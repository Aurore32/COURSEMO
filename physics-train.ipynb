      "{'Question': 'Discuss the view that price stability should be the main aim of government.', 'Answer': ' The focus on rising GDP can also help decrease unemployment, maintain a healthy balance of payments and help a country become more competitive internationally. As the potential and capabilities of the economy increase, the economy will operate more efficiently. Greater opportunities will be available for the citizens of the country and it will attract foreign investment. Some inflation may be acceptable in order to pursue the objective of growth. Secondly, it could be argued that economic growth should be the main aim of government. For developing countries and arguably developed economies, economic growth can be seen to be the main aim. Economic growth is measured by the rise of GDP. In fig. 1 you can see the impact of an increase in aggregate demand on real GDP and the price level. Depending on the levels of spare capacity, increases in economic growth may not have a significant impact on the price level. In addition, in fig. 2, there is an increase in aggregate supply, which drives up output but actually lowers the price level. Price stability could be the main aim of a government whose economy is facing rapid and excessive inflation. During times of excessive inflation, there are many costs which are borne by society. For example, when prices rise rapidly, businesses are reluctant to invest, as it is difficult to project for the future. If a business is preparing for an investment project, they won‚Äôt be able to accurately predict the costs of doing so nor the returns. During periods of high inflation and low price stability, businesses will suffer. In addition, consumers will suffer as their purchasing power has eroded. Their money will not buy the same amount of goods and services as it did before the rise in prices. Price stability is a macroeconomic objective of government. It means that the government aims to maintain low and stable inflation over time. There are several other objectives of government such as sustained economic growth, maintaining a healthy balance of payments and keeping a low rate of unemployment. On balance, the extent to which price stability should be the main aim of an economy depends on the macroeconomic issues it is facing. If an economy has low levels of inflation and excess capacity, then it should not be a priority. In this situation, the government should focus on economic growth and lowering unemployment. However, during periods of high inflation and price instability, the government should absolutely make price stability the main aim. Dependent upon the economic conditions of the country, the priorities will change. However, it is important to note that focusing on price stability should be the main aim of a government who is facing rapid and sustained inflation.

      "The current account (CA) is part of the balance of payments (BOP). The CA records four types of transactions: visible, invisible, investment and transfer payments. Visible exports and imports are recorded as trade in goods. Invisible exports and imports include services, interest and profit payments. Investment payments include foreign direct investment into a country and investment payments by citizens of a country to foreign enterprises. Transfer payments include international transfers of money, for example, foreign aid payments. The CA records the balance of these four types of transactions. If the balance is positive then the economy has a surplus in the current account. If the balance is negative then the economy has a deficit. A deficit in the current account is financed by a capital surplus. The CA deficit is an indication of a leakage in the circular flow of income. The leakage is a result of the economy's failure to produce enough goods and services to satisfy the wants of consumers. It is also a result of the economy's failure to invest in goods and services which will be of benefit to the economy in the future. The leakage is financed by a withdrawal of funds from the circular flow. This is achieved by borrowing money from other countries. The deficit in the current account causes the exchange rate to fall. This is illustrated in the graph below: In the diagram the initial equilibrium of the exchange rate is Rs. 100 = $1. At this rate there is equilibrium in the foreign exchange market. There is neither a shortage nor a surplus of $ in the market. When there is a deficit in the current account the exchange rate falls to Rs. 110 = $1. This means that Rs. 110 will now purchase $1. The fall in the exchange rate is expected to improve the balance of trade in goods and services. This is illustrated in the graph below:  The effect of a fall in the exchange rate on the balance of trade in goods is shown in the graph above. The quantity of exports rises from X to X1. The quantity of imports falls from M to M1. This is because the exchange rate has fallen from Rs. 100 = $1 to Rs. 110 = $1. The price of imports in Rs. has increased. The price of exports in $ has fallen. Expenditure-reducing policies are contractionary fiscal policies. They are designed to reduce the level of government expenditure and/or increase the level of taxation. The effect of these policies is to reduce the level of economic activity. In times of recession this is the correct policy to adopt. The government should reduce its expenditure and/or raise taxes. This will help to reduce the deficit in the current account. However, in times of high growth, when there is a deficit in the current account, the government should adopt expenditure-switching policies. These policies are designed to divert expenditure away from imports and towards home-produced goods and services. Examples of these policies include the introduction of import controls, such as quotas and tariffs. The government can also use its expenditure to encourage the purchase of home-produced goods and services. The effect of these policies is to reduce the deficit in the current account. However, they do have the disadvantage of causing inflation and worsening the balance of payments current account deficit on the balance of payments for an economy with a floating exchange rate.<|eot_id|>\n"
