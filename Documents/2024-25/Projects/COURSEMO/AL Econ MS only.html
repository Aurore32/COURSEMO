<p><strong>Indicative content</strong></p>
<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on international trade.</li>
<li>One of the main potential negative effects of globalisation on high-income economies might be caused by the import of goods produced at low cost by other countries. This might cause a rise in unemployment.</li>
<li>Analysis should be provided to show the impact of selective tariffs on imports into high-income countries. A clear, accurately labelled diagram should be provided to underpin this analysis.</li>
<li>Further analysis should be provided to illustrate the potential impact on different stakeholders of these tariffs. For example, an increase in tax revenue can be re-invested into the economy to promote long term economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The imposition of tariffs may lead to retaliation by other countries, possibly leading to a trade war and misallocation of resources.</li>
<li>Restricting imports and subsequent trade diversion will reduce allocative and productive efficiently and lead to a net welfare loss.</li>
<li>Tariffs will lead to higher prices for both consumers and producers due to lack of international competition.</li>
<li>In some cases, higher tariffs will lead to higher costs which could lead to higher prices, falling demand and ultimately increase the level of unemployment.</li>
<li>Although tariffs might reduce the negative effects of globalisation, they might also remove some existing benefits of globalisation. For example, by reducing choice for consumers.</li>
<li>Protecting inefficient domestic firms by using tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the economy in the long term.</li>
<li>A conclusion should attempt to use cost/benefit analysis and use the preceding analysis to examine the net effect of the introduction of selective tariffs by high-income countries on their economies.</li>

<p><strong>Evaluate this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question. <br>AO1 and AO2 out of 14 marks. AO3 out of 6 marks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Indicative content</strong></p>
<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A definition of what is meant by inflation.</li>
<li>An explanation of what constitutes the key components of the money supply. This should primarily consist of commercial bank balances held at the central bank plus all bank deposits held in the commercial banks.</li>
<li>Examples of the instruments available to use by the central bank to control the money supply. Reference to and explanation of Open Market operations/Quantitative Easing, plus the use of changes in interest rates should be made and explained.</li>
<li>The potential link between changes in the money supply and/or changes in the rate of interest rate and inflation should be examined.</li>
<li>Analysis of the use of specific monetary policy instruments and their impact on reducing the money supply should be provided. For example, examining the links between the sale of long-term government securities and changes in the level of bank deposits.</li>
<li>Analysis of how changes in interest rates/money supply might impact upon the level of aggregate demand and inflation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The money supply is very difficult to measure, thus there are many different definitions of what might constitute the money supply.</li>
<li>The link between changes in the money and changes in the price level is not altogether clear.</li>
<li>The link between changes in the rate of interest and changes in the money supply are not always clear. For example, an increase in the rate of interest might lead to an increase in savings. This would cause bank deposits and therefore, the money supply to rise.</li>
<li>The effectiveness of the use of monetary policy to control inflation will also depend upon the cause of inflation. For example, demand pull inflation might be controlled more effectively by the use of contractionary fiscal policy.</li>
<li>A conclusion should use the preceding discussion to decide the extent to which this type of monetary is likely to be used effectively to control inflation.</li>

<li>An explanation of how monopsony markets work should be provided, emphasising the importance of how wages are determined in this type of market.</li>
<li>A diagram should be provided which shows a monopsony labour market and used to show how wages and level of employment are determined.</li>
<li>Analysis should refer to the factors which affect both the supply of and demand for labour in both these types of labour market.</li>

<li>Evaluation should then be used to link external factors which might affect final wage levels in both markets. For example, Trades Union or government intervention. <br>In some cases, the intervention of Trades Union might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. This would support that wages would be higher in a perfectly competitive labour market.</li>
<li>Although a monopsony labour market model would predict lower wages due to buyer power on the part of monopsony firms, other factors will still determine the extent to which monopsony market wages will remain low. For example, the ease with which capital can be substituted for labour.</li>
<li>Also, the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry will influence the extent to which wages might rise in either market.</li>
<li>Accusations of labour exploitation might lead to government intervention in a monopsony labour market. A minimum wage might be fixed that it is higher than wages gained in a perfectly competitive labour market.</li>
<li>Trades Unions might also intervene in monopsony markets and enable workers to gain higher wages through collective bargaining.</li>
<li>Higher wages might not be sustainable in the long run in perfectly competitive markets, due to increases in the supply of labour responding to the opportunity to gain higher wages.</li>
<li>A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the question preceding argument.</li>

<ul>
<li>Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction.</li>
<li>This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.</li>
<li>Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.</li>
<li>One form of government intervention might be the introduction of indirect taxation. A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of an indirect taxation on the level of output and efficiency.</li>
<li>Analysis would use this to show the impact of an indirect tax on the PC curve.</li>
<li>Further analysis should then identify the links between the indirect tax and the behaviour of firms. This would link the creation of negative externalities to the benefits of removing them and then linking this to addressing this cause of market failure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A government might introduce indirect taxation however it is difficult to determine the extent of the taxation necessary which will address the issue of market failure without causing other problems, for example, an increase in unemployment.</li>
<li>Also, the impact of indirect taxation in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.</li>
<li>Some large firms might produce and sell products which have an inelastic demand therefore this would be unlikely to have a significant impact on output and efficiency.</li>
<li>The introduction of indirect taxation might be costly and unnecessarily bureaucratic, as well as being difficult to monitor and enforce.</li>
<li>It might be that government intervention based on the use of alternative more direct approaches such as the use of pollution permit might be more effective.</li>
<li>Indirect taxation is regressive and might unfairly penalise lower income groups.</li>
<li>A conclusion should consider alternatives, compare these with the use of indirect taxation and attempt to form some judgement regarding the effectiveness of this type of policy.</li>

<p>In 2021, one of the largest United States (US) technology companies averaged sales of US$1.2 billion a day. It took less than four seconds to earn US$52000, the average American yearly salary. Three of the largest technology companies reported record breaking sales and profits. Five of the largest companies made combined profits of over US$68 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were helped by the Covid-19 pandemic that caused a huge increase in online working and shopping. The ability to work and shop online was greatly welcomed by many who were forced to stay at home.</p>
<p>Critics, however, worry that if this trend to large firms continues the future will be controlled by a handful of super-rich, super-powerful companies. They will dominate economic activity. This is not just bad for the economy; it is bad for consumers and bad for competition. Also, economic concentration causes unacceptable inequality. One powerful firm tried to prevent workers joining a trade union.</p>
<p>Their huge cash reserves mean that they could undercut possible new entrants and prevent competition. Investors will be wary of investing in possible competitors and new owners would be prepared to sell out to the dominant firms rather than try and compete.</p>
<p>The size of the firm gives it political power to fight any official or government intervention. Governments are beginning to be aware of this. The chair of the US body that deals with competition law said there was a range of potential risks created by the large companies. The government is aware of their ability to avoid paying taxes and their ability to dominate allows them to expand into markets for similar products.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, a co-founder of one of the large firms said ‘Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who used the term creative destruction would be proud’. But now that co-founder is not so sure. ‘We went from being pirates to being the navy. People may love pirates when they are young and small, but nobody likes a navy that acts like a pirate. Today’s technology giants are just like that’.</p>

<p><strong>Distinguish between limit pricing and predatory pricing.</strong></p>
<p>Limit Pricing is a strategy used by the existing supplier to restrict the entry of new entrants into the market. The existing firm sets a price low enough to prevent new entrants considering it a worthwhile market in which to try and compete. They set a price possibly close to average cost so that just normal profit is made. (2)</p>
<p>Predatory pricing by contrast is a strategy which is used by one supplier to force another supplier already in the market to leave the market. They set a price below unit cost in the short run to drive out competition. Then later raise prices to recover those losses. It is considered anti-competitive and is illegal under their anti-trust laws. (2)</p>

<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Definition and explanation of long-term economic growth as a function of more inputs such as labour, land, and equipment creating an outwards shift of the productive possibility curve. Economic growth is measurable in terms of increases in real GDP.</li>
<li>Many developing countries are characterised by low incomes which prevent savings and the funds needed to finance investment and economic growth. Funding is needed to finance the investment and technological aspects of economic growth which comes from internal sources (savings) or from foreign lending/investment.</li>
<li>Foreign investment may be from governments (e.g. China’s Belt and Roads initiative), international agencies (e.g. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) or sovereign wealth funds. Governments borrow from other governments and international agencies to invest in infrastructure and other development projects which under lie economic growth.</li>
<li>Private capital investment via multinational corporations (e.g. Toyota, Intel). MNC investment is usually in factories, plant and machinery which increase output directly.</li>
<li>Candidates may analyse the effects of the increase in investment through aggregate supply and demand analysis.</li>
<li>Successful investment requires a return (marginal efficiency of capital (MEC)) which exceeds the rate of interest that has been relatively easy to obtain.</li>
<li>The effects of rising interest rates on developing countries: Many developing countries will suffer from falling exchange rates, especially if US$ interest rates rise this will increase the US$ funding cost of borrowings. The balance of payments (X-M) will deteriorate.</li>
<li>Accept references to IMF and World Bank lending investment funds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact depends on the proportion of funding which comes from abroad and how much is locally sourced. If domestic funds are not available, then how else will the growth be funded.</li>
<li>The quality of the investment projects and the likelihood of realising a profit will affect the ability to cover the increase in interest rates. In some cases ‘vanity projects’ with little long-term economic benefit are funded (Roads to Nowhere) which enhance the standing of the government amongst its supporters but have no economic benefit.</li>
<li>The short-term effects of the project in terms of raising aggregate demand may be of limited benefit to the borrower if the lender requires much of the construction and materials to be sourced from them. This will have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments.</li>
<li>Higher interest rates in high income countries will raise the cost of borrowing by the low-income country. This means the cost of financing projects has risen representing an opportunity cost for borrowing. The balance of payments current account will deteriorate as the higher interest is paid.</li>
<li>Many low-income countries may be affected by a commodity price slump which reduces export earnings and depreciates a floating exchange rate making interest rate and capital repayment more expensive.</li>

<ul>
<li>Definition/explanation of privatisation: the selling of state-owned corporations (the meaning of the term can include the provision of services and goods by private firms).</li>
<li>Explanation of productive/allocative efficiency. X-inefficiency.</li>
<li>A model of monopolistic competition/oligopoly/monopoly is used to analyse the effects on efficiency of shifting to privatised economy</li>
<li>Definition/explanation of a market economy.</li>
<li>Development of benefits of privatisation: <br>– Greater competition in the market if an industry is privatised as competing firms. <br>– Greater scrutiny of operation by shareholders should hold the company to account and increase efficiency. <br>– Wider access to funds - not dependent on a government’s wider economic concerns.</li>
<li>Analysis may be in terms of comparing the monopoly model with one which is more competitive e.g. monopolistic competition or oligopoly and drawing the relevant inferences.</li>
<li>Relevant diagrams correctly drawn and labelled with accurate reference to them in the text.</li>
<li>Reduction in the need for the government to finance the activity and the implications for fiscal policy.</li>
<li>A further source of funds for the government that can be used to repay government debt and reduce the burden of interest payments. The funds can be devoted to education/health services improving economic development.</li>
<li>The cost of a loss-making state industry is no longer borne by the general tax-payer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation against productive, allocative and/or dynamic efficiency.</li>
<li>Privatisation may lead to the break-up of a natural monopoly e.g. railways/water pipelines. The problem of the ‘final mile delivery’.</li>
<li>A state monopoly may simply be replaced with a private monopoly. Competition may be unrealistic due to high barriers to entry (BTE).</li>
<li>Many privatisations are accompanied by an industry regulator which suggests that the privatisation needs policing. The amount and direction of investment, and the pricing strategy are reviewed to maintain the industry’s efficiency.</li>
<li>Equity the transfer of profitable state-owned assets to private individuals means the contribution they might make to the state funds are lost.</li>
<li>Often there is a loss of employment in the industry and the burden of unemployment pay falls on the government raising the fiscal deficit or requiring more borrowing.</li>
<li>Private firms are only concerned with private costs and benefits, they ignore negative externalities and their consequences.</li>

<p>The factors of production land, labour, capital and enterprise form the basis for all economic output. Whilst land is geographically fixed, the other factors of production, for example labour, are mobile. Large numbers of migrants move from country to country every year. Many migrate to the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average increase in the number of migrants working in the US was 0.6 million per year until 2018. However, the Covid-19 restrictions in place since 2019 prevented migration and by 2022 the total number of migrants working in the US was nearly 2 million lower than expected.</p>
<p>Half of migrants initially come as students, to be college educated, often in science-based subjects. Post-graduation, they often remain to work in the high-tech industries, before many return to their home countries with enhanced skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well-educated immigrants are three times more likely to start businesses than inhabitants of the US. The reduction in the number of new migrants would reduce the number of new businesses and this, in turn, would reduce job creation by an estimated 200000.</p>
<p>The remaining non-college educated migrants work mainly in lower-paid sectors such as retail and agriculture. They also play an important role in industries such as hospitality and food-related services. Many of the migrants send money to family members who remain in their home countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 shows the relationship between job vacancies in various industries and the share of migrant workers in the workforces of these industries in the US.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1: Unfilled job vacancies (%) and migrant workers in the workforce (%) for selected US industries, 2019</strong></p>
<p>The reduction in migrants took place at the same time as more older US workers retired.</p>
<p>Mexicans and Central Americans form the largest share of migrants, at over 35% of the total. Average incomes in their home countries are between 10% and 20% of the US average. There is also significant unemployment and under-employment in their home countries. In the US, migrants earn on average 12% less than the average wage for all workers. This varies by ethnic origin: Hispanic workers earn 16% less than the average while white workers earn 15% more than average.&nbsp;</p>

<li>The shape of the AS curve – whether it is horizontal or vertical in the short-run. Keynesians argue AS is more elastic in the SR</li>
<li>Expansionary fiscal and monetary should not be used as they only create higher inflation.</li>
<li>Phillips curve relationship may no longer be valid. In the 1970s there was high inflation and high unemployment, in the 2000s there was low unemployment and low inflation.</li>
<li>In the 1960s/1970s there was more structural strength between wages and inflation as there was a larger proportion of unionised labour and the ability of workers to negotiate higher wages was stronger.</li>
<li>Since the 1950s when the Phillips curve relationship was determined, there has been a significant increase in world trade and development of MNC the supply of labour is no longer limited by national borders.</li>

<p>Many low-income countries have high unemployment and large deposits of unused natural resources. In 2007, Ghana discovered a new offshore oil field and extraction started in 2010. The discovery and extraction of such natural resources can create new jobs, that increase incomes and consequently gross national income (GNI). The additional income will lead to an increase in spending on both domestic and imported goods and services, creating further employment in other sectors through the multiplier effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the extraction of oil may ‘crowd out’ other sectors of the economy. Workers might move, for example from agriculture and manufacturing to the mining sector due to higher wages. Also, the prices of houses, land and locally produced goods may increase. This could increase the cost of living and discourage businesses from operating in the affected region.</p>
<p>The export of oil from Ghana causes an inflow of United States dollars (US$), increasing the exchange rate of Ghana’s currency, the cedi. This appreciation reduces the competitiveness of Ghana’s agricultural and manufactured goods, leading to an increased demand for imports. This loss of competitiveness is referred to as the ‘Dutch disease’, reflecting the experience of the Netherlands following the exploitation of their natural gas reserves.</p>
<p>Oil provides the Ghanaian government with revenue from the tax on each barrel of oil produced. This revenue can be used to provide transfer payments and goods and services such as roads, health facilities, and public water supply. These can benefit both households and businesses. Alternatively, the presence of such revenues can create corruption and conflict as political groups compete for them.</p>
<p>Between 2011 and 2018 agricultural products and food as a share of Ghana’s exports have decreased, as shown in Fig. 1.1.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Protectionism is when governments attempt to protect domestic businesses against foreign competition (1).</li>

<p><strong>Indicative content</strong><br>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Protectionism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages of protectionism – for example, tariffs can reduce the value of imports in the short term as infant industries grow and gain the economies of scale to enable them to be internationally price competitive. This reduction in foreign dependency will reduce the value of imports which (ceteris paribus) reduce a deficit on the current account.</li>
<li>Problems of protectionism includes – the ability to reduce the value of imports will be influenced by the price elasticity of demand for imports. Moreover, the possibility of retaliation thereby reducing the value of exports. This may not only limit any reduction in the current account deficit but may hinder a government’s ability to achieve other macroeconomic objectives – e.g., reducing the level of unemployment or possibility of increasing cost-push inflation.</li>
<li>Alternative policies that may be considered include contractionary monetary policy – higher interest rates will increase the cost of debt and mortgage repayments and leave people with less money to spend. Therefore, this will reduce their consumption of imports, improving the current account.</li>
<li>Problems of the alternative policy – for example, an increase in interest rates will tend to cause hot money flows and therefore an appreciation in the exchange rate. This appreciation makes exports less competitive, and imports more attractive. Assuming demand is relatively elastic, this appreciation will worsen the current account.</li>

<ul>
<li>Free goods are not scarce and have zero opportunity cost / no prices as no factors of production are required to produce them (1).</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the vaccine is free at the point of use to the consumer (1). However, there is a cost to the taxpayer (1). This means that there is an opportunity cost to the government as providing the vaccine involves the use of scarce resources (1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>If governments provide free-of-charge vaccinations, then there is no price charged to the consumer (1). This means consumers do not need to use their own their own scarce resources to be vaccinated (1) which means there is no opportunity cost to them because they do not need to make a choice between ‘consuming’ the vaccine and reducing their consumption of other goods and services (1).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 2 marks for evaluating whether or not free-to-charge vaccinations offered by a government can be considered a free good.

<p>Coffee is big business, especially in the United States (US). The global market was worth nearly US$110bn in 2020, with production around 10m tonnes of coffee beans. 95% of this production came from thousands of small-scale producers in South America, Central America, Asia and Africa. If present trends continue, production is forecast to triple by 2050. The Arabica coffee bean price was at a 10-year high in January 2022, having more than doubled in 2021. Fig. 1.1 shows the world price of coffee in United States dollars (US$) per pound (lb) weight. A pound is 454 grammes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/27fd4b8ce46911efb52f00163e02ecea-1738832576.png" alt="" width="472" height="255"></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Source: tradingeconomics.com, 18 February 2022</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1: Arabica coffee bean price, 2002 to 2022</strong></p>
<p>So how can this huge price increase be explained? The main cause was a series of weather events affecting Brazil, the world’s largest producer of high quality Arabica coffee beans. Its market share is 35% of total global supply. There was severe drought in early 2021 that reduced the number of ‘cherries’, which contain the beans on coffee bushes. The crop yield was further damaged by frosts that followed the drought. As a result of these weather events, Brazil produced its smallest volume of quality coffee beans for ten years.</p>
<p>In addition, the production of cheaper low-quality Robusta coffee beans in Vietnam was badly affected by storms which stripped the bushes of their ‘cherries’. Overall, there was a very large decrease in the global supply of all coffee beans.</p>
<p>Supply issues affecting major producing countries like Brazil and Vietnam mean that the volume of coffee beans produced regularly fluctuates between ‘high’ years and ‘low’ years. Producers try to reduce their risks through buffer stock schemes in order to maintain a regular income stream. This type of scheme is particularly important for the many small-scale subsistence producers who have no other source of income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dramatic weather events of 2021 have been exceptional, although a few large-scale producers in Brazil who survived the immediate impact of drought and frost should gain from the huge rise in the price of coffee beans. But what about the thousands of other producers elsewhere who lack power in the market? The most likely outcome is that they will once again become victims of the unpredictable global market for coffee beans.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Use a demand and supply diagram to show why there was a ‘huge’ increase in the price of Arabica coffee beans in 2021. [2]</li>
<li>Is the price elasticity of supply of coffee beans likely to be elastic or inelastic in any one year? Justify your answer from the information provided. [2]</li>
<li>Consider whether a buffer stock scheme is likely to be successful in reducing the price fluctuations shown in Fig. 1.1. [4]</li>

<p>Buffer stocks schemes occur when governments buy and sell coffee beans to stabilise prices (1).

<p><strong>Up to 3 marks for explanation/analysis of the gains to coffee bean producers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the demand for coffee is price inelastic in demand, then coffee producers would be expected to gain (in terms of increased revenue).</li>

<li>Producers in Brazil and Vietnam and with existing stocks of coffee that survived the frost and storms would expect to increase their own sales at the expense of those rivals unable to produce a large enough yield of coffee.</li>
<li>Similarly, producers in countries not affected by climatic problems should benefit from increased sales and revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Up to 3 marks for explanation/analysis of the extent to which coffee bean producers will not gain:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the demand for coffee is price elastic in demand, then coffee producers would not be expected to gain (in terms of reduced revenue).</li>
<li>For example, those producers unable to produce a sufficiently large enough yield may make losses which may ultimately result in business closures.</li>

<p><strong>Up to 3 marks for explanation/analysis of potential benefits to economies of major producers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rising coffee prices will result in higher taxes paid to governments which can be used to finance other internal projects – e.g. improvements to education and development of infrastructure and reduce a country’s reliance on coffee bean production.</li>

<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate knowledge and understanding of marginal rate of tax (MRT). That is an understanding that it is the proportion of extra income taken in tax (1).</li>
<li>Accurate knowledge and understanding of average rate of tax (<strong>ART</strong>) <br>i.e., an understanding that it is the proportion of the whole of income that is taxed (1).</li>
<li>An accurate example (which may be numerical/graphical) of each type of tax. <strong>MRT </strong>– a person earns an extra £100 and £40 is taken as tax then the marginal rate is 40%. <strong>ART </strong>– an individual with total earnings of £10 000, total tax paid £3000 the average rate is 30% (1).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)</strong></p>
<p>Discussion is likely to focus on whether the gains in revenue exceed the disadvantages of the indirect taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>easier and quicker to put in place than direct taxes</li>
<li>they may be less easy to avoid than direct taxes</li>
<li>however, they are often seen as regressive and can lead to a higher MRT for poorer households</li>
<li>their effectiveness in raising revenue depends on PED</li>
<li>they may also lead to cost push inflation</li>

<p>Follow the point-based marking guidance at the top of this mark scheme and award:<br>up to 3 marks for AO1 Knowledge and understanding, up to 3 marks for AO2 Analysis, and up to 2 marks for AO3 Evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)</strong></p>
<p>The question refers to methods of measurement and <strong>not </strong>types of unemployment. Answers focused on types and not measures cannot answer the question without any reference to methods of measurement and <strong>must not be rewarded</strong>. <br>For the identification of 2 methods of measuring unemployment (1) plus for a brief explanation of both measures 2x(1).</p>
<p><strong>Guidance for explanation marks:</strong> <br>The two most used measures are the claimant count measure which is a measure based on those claiming benefits (1) and the labour force measure which is a measure of unemployment based on a survey that identifies people who are actively seeking a job (1). However, if the meaning of these measures is clearly understood then they do not need to explicitly refer to the terms.</p>
<p><strong>AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The difficulties in obtaining an accurate measurement using <strong>both </strong>methods should be considered. e.g., the claimant count figure may omit people actively looking for a job and may include people who are, in reality, not looking for a job.</li>
<li>Whereas the labour force measure is based on sampling which may not be entirely accurate due to sampling errors and/or problems associated with data collection in general.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>maximum </strong>of <strong>2 marks</strong> if the difficulties of only one method of measurement are analysed.</p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>An assessment of the difficulties of both measures is required with an overall assessment of the extent of the possible difficulties (1), leading to a valid conclusion (1).</p>

<ul>
<li>The discussion should focus on the strengths and weaknesses of supply side policy to solve <strong>both </strong>cyclical/demand-deficient <strong>and </strong>structural unemployment.</li>
<li>For example, supply side policies may be used to encourage investment into education and training and infrastructure to solve structural problems in the economy and hence structural unemployment.</li>
<li>However, supply side policies may be less successful in solving cyclical/demand deficient unemployment as they have less impact on the level of aggregate demand (AD) – unless for example, if they involve a direct injection of government spending due to the additional investment.</li>
<li>Other disadvantages include the potential cost of the policy and the time taken for the policy to be effective.</li>
<li>Although not necessary, other demand side policies, e.g., fiscal and monetary policies, may be analysed to explain the possible disadvantages of supply side policy. This is an acceptable approach.</li>

<p>For example, future economic growth will be influenced by the choices an economy makes about the split between consumer spending and capital spending (1). If a country decides to focus its spending and output on consumer goods, then this may create growth in the short run but may not be sustainable (1). A decision to focus on spending and output of capital goods, this may have a short run negative impact on economic growth but should create more long-term sustainable growth as output may expand (1).</p>

<ul>
<li>Price changes and the availability of complements (a negative value indicates a complement) e.g. a rise in the price of the complement would be expected to reduce the demand for the ‘other good’.</li>
<li>Price changes and the availability of substitutes (a positive value indicates a substitute) e.g. a rise in the price of the substitute would be expected to increase the demand for the ‘other good’.</li>
<li>For example, an increase in the price of a complement good is likely to reduce the demand of the good (1) due to the nature of the joint demand between both goods (1).</li>
<li>For example, a rise in the price of a substitute good is likely to increase the demand for the other good (1) if the consumer now sees the other good as a direct replacement (1).</li>

<p>Chile is the world’s biggest copper producer with 28% of global copper production and the second biggest producer of lithium with 22% of world production. Overall, mining contributes 11% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and more than 50% of the value of the country’s total exports. World copper and lithium prices have increased quickly since 2020. This has led to strong growth in GDP which is expected to increase by 3.5% in 2022, exceeding earlier estimates of 2.5% as world demand is expected to grow following the Covid-19 pandemic. Fig 1.1 shows the world price of copper in United States dollars (US$) per pound (lb) weight. A pound is 454 grammes.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/6220986ae46311ef81d300163e02ecea-1738830097.png" alt="" width="580" height="299"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig 1.1: World copper price, 2017 to 2022</strong></p>
<p>Economic growth in Chile has also been helped by the world’s highest rate of vaccination against Covid-19 and a rapid economic recovery from the pandemic which has led to a large increase in consumer spending.</p>
<p>However, the trade in goods surplus has fallen substantially in February 2022. This is mainly because of a 9.2% fall in the revenue from copper exports due to the higher prices and a fall in world demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. There has also been a 38.3% increase in the value of imported consumer goods. As a consequence, the current account deficit has widened substantially to US$7.5bn in the first quarter of 2022 from a deficit of US$1.1bn in the first quarter of 2021 despite a surplus of US$50m in the secondary income account.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig 1.2: Chile’s balance of trade in goods, March 2021 to February 2022&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>One of the main benefits of Chile’s increased prosperity in recent years has been a decline in the number of people living at or below the minimum income level of US$5.50 per day. However, Chile remains the most unequal country in the list of largely developed countries according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with an income gap 65% wider than the OECD average. In addition, although the Gini coefficient has fallen from 52.1 to 44.4, this is still higher than lower-income countries such as Haiti and El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try and reduce this inequality in income and wealth, the Chilean government has increased its expenditure on education from 3% of GDP in 1997 to 5.4% in 2018. Further recognition of the importance of education as a merit good is shown by the government increasing its education spending by 3.4% each year since 2018. Chile has also recently made all college tuition free of charge. It is hoped that this will reduce the gap in the quality of education received by the wealthiest and poorest students and open up opportunities for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Identify <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> possible reasons why the current account on the balance of payments in Chile is in deficit in the first quarter of 2022 despite the surplus on the balance of trade in goods.</strong></p>
<p>The data also states the secondary account is in surplus so the primary account (1) and /or the balance of services (1) must show a deficit.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance:</strong> <br>Please also accept valid references to any of the components of the primary account i.e., net income from investments made abroad, earnings made by residents working abroad being in deficit. <strong>(1 max if no additional reference to services)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Do <strong>not </strong>accept references to components of the secondary account e.g., transfers, government aid.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative approach:</strong> <br>Many candidates have answered why the current account deficit has grown rather than why it is in deficit in the first quarter of 2022. This is by reference to the final paragraph on page 2 of the data e.g., the fall in revenue from copper exports, the increase in the value of imported consumer goods and the impact of the pandemic.</p>

<p>For an explanation of the reasons / benefits of the government increasing education spending to improve the incomes of poorer households <strong>(Up to 3 marks)</strong>. These <strong>may </strong>include:</p>
<ul>
<li>As the data makes clear, education is considered a merit good that is considered to be beneficial for the individual and society in e.g., raising income levels due to a better educated and skilled workforce.</li>
<li>Additional spending may increase the availability of education provision and free college tuition fees may make it more affordable to poorer households.</li>
<li>Increased provision may also reduce other costs of education, again making it more affordable and accessible.</li>
<li>It may raise awareness of the benefits of education for poorer households.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>For an explanation of why increased government spending on education may not have the desired effects <strong>(Up to 3 marks)</strong>. These <strong>may </strong>include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may still be a lack of awareness of the benefits of education due to information failure.</li>
<li>Poorer households may have higher opportunity costs due to the need to start earning an income at an earlier age.</li>
<li>Government spending may be unsustainable leading to reductions in future spending.</li>

<p><strong>Up to 4 marks for the explanation / analysis:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Up to 3 marks for a discussion of the advantages of a rise in copper prices which include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mining forms 50% of Chile’s exports and contributes towards 11% of GDP and copper is a major part of this.<strong> N.B</strong>., a simple reference to the importance of copper mining to the Chilean economy will be sufficient.</li>
<li>As world demand picks up and prices rise, assuming demand for copper is relatively price inelastic, revenue from exports should rise leading to a rise in GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Up to 3 marks for a discussion of the disadvantages of a rise in copper prices which include:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data shows revenue from copper exports had fallen in February 2022 due to higher prices suggesting PED is more elastic/more substitutes available leading to a fall in revenue and GDP if the world copper price continues to rise.</li>
<li>It may encourage more competition from other copper producing countries.</li>
<li>Copper is a finite resource, and extensive mining may lead to depletion in the future leading to a future fall in export revenue and GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Max: 4 marks</strong><br><strong>Note</strong>: maximum of 3 marks if only one side is considered.</p>
<p><strong>Up to 2 marks for evaluation (no marks if only one side is considered)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That assesses both sides and may include the argument that the fall in revenue from copper exports would be temporary due to a downturn in demand and that this would change as the world economy starts to grow again (1), leading to</li>

<p>Argentina’s annual inflation rate increased from just over 40% in February 2021 to just over 50% in January 2022. Argentina’s annual inflation rate, as measured by changes in the consumer price index (CPI) over 12 months is shown in Fig. 1.1.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1 Annual rate of inflation in Argentina, February 2021 to January 2022</strong></p>
<p>Argentina has the fifth highest inflation rate in the world after Venezuela, Sudan, Suriname and Zimbabwe. It is forecast to continue to rise during 2022 to reach an annual rate of between 55% and 58% by the end of the year. One of the main reasons for this high rate of inflation is excessive growth of the money supply. The need to lower the rate of inflation in Argentina is considered essential by many economists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government of Argentina has tried to control the increase in the rate of inflation by imposing maximum prices on 1432 products. This has the advantage of limiting price increases, but such a policy can also have a number of disadvantages. One such disadvantage is the creation of excess demand in markets.</p>
<p>Another policy has been to increase interest rates. In January 2022, Argentina’s central bank raised its main interest rate from 38% to 40%, but many economists argued that this increase was insufficient to control inflation. This is because the real interest rate will be negative. A more appropriate monetary policy would be to lift the interest rate above the inflation rate so that the real interest rate will be positive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Identification and explanation of market failure regarding this question may relate to allocative inefficiency, productive inefficiency or information failure. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC or MSB = MSC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Productive inefficiency occurs when the firm is not producing at its minimum average costs. Forms of competition other than perfect competition may be used to show both the lack of allocative and productive efficiency.</li>
<li>Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market&nbsp;</li>
<li>forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-consumption of a good or service. The negative externality leads to an over production of the good.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A wide range of government intervention can be used to correct market failure. These may include:<br>subsidies to increase consumption<br>indirect taxation producers<br>use of advertising<br>the direct provision of goods and services<br>price restrictions/quantity direction&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive/negative externality on the level of output and the welfare change will be identified.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of market failure and may compare this with the efficient level of output when the market failure is taken into account.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The diagram may be amended or re-drawn to show the impact of a chosen policy(ies) and the impact on consumption or production shown.</li>
<li>Reference to the diagram and the outcomes it illustrates showed be made in the text.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A government might introduce a subsidy/indirect tax to encourage consumers/producers to change behaviour, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy/indirect tax.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.</li>
<li>Indirect taxes may be used to offset the effect of the market failure.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long</li>
<li>time to become effective depending on the length of contract or production process.</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities, but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.</li>

<p>The advantage of the car is that it provides freedom for the consumer. However, the disadvantages of car use are that it creates congestion, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and air pollution. These disadvantages led many countries to agree to replace internal combustion engine (ICE) cars with electric vehicles (EV) from 2030.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successful introduction of EV is dependent on the development of battery technology and production of batteries to enable EV to drive a similar distance to ICE cars before they need re-charging. Better electrode design, battery assembly and chemistry are all technical aspects of battery production that could reduce costs, resulting in economies of scale from more efficient use of capital and labour. In addition to technical economies, there may well be purchasing economies of scale in battery production when buying raw materials and capital equipment in bulk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 1.1 shows the estimated average costs of battery production for EV using two different technologies.</p>

<p>The shift to EV will cause redundancies for highly skilled mechanical engineers who have developed and refined the ICE. Often these workers are concentrated in specific areas, such as southern Germany.</p>
<p>The change from ICE cars to EV may also cause difficulties for governments in two ways. First, many countries rely on oil exports for a large part of their income. For example, Saudi Arabia receives 45% of its gross national income (GNI) from oil exports. Secondly, other governments place an indirect tax on petrol (gasoline) and diesel as part of their general revenue. For example, Singapore charges S$0.41 per litre, approximately 17% of the price.</p>

<p>According to a report by the World Bank, income inequality has declined in some low-income countries in recent years. For example, between 2008 and 2018, the Gini coefficient decreased by more than 5 percentage points in Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In some other countries, such as Ethiopia, India and Indonesia income inequality has remained relatively stable over the past decade while it has increased in China and South Africa.</p>
<p>In low-income countries inequalities of opportunity, in particular the differences in access to education between females and males, appear to pose obstacles to a more equal income distribution. Equality of opportunity becomes an issue of macroeconomic relevance.</p>
<p>Table 1.1 shows Gini coefficients, female/male literacy ratios and the percentages of population in absolute poverty for five countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to note that income inequality is a complex issue that can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic growth, government policies and global economic trends. The government can use fiscal and supply-side policies to influence and change income distribution. These could lead to higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and increased economic growth.</p>
<p>While the Gini coefficient is the most widely used measure of income inequality, it is important to note that it has limitations. It does not take into account other factors that contribute to inequality such as wealth inequality, and it may not take into account the full extent of inequality in societies with large informal economies.</p>

<li>It measures the number of exports that have to be sold to buy a given number of imports. <strong>(1)</strong></li>

<p><strong>AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The two main causes of changes in the terms of trade occur e.g., when there is an increase in export prices and a fall in import prices. Such changes are often the result of changes in the demand for exports and the demand for imports. <strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Low-income countries are more likely to export primary goods and to import manufactured goods. The demand for primary goods may be lower than that for manufactured goods when income rises, e.g., for agricultural goods, so import prices may fall and terms of trade deteriorates. <strong>(1)&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>However, commodity prices such as oil may have an inelastic demand and prices may rise leading to an improvement in terms of trade. <strong>(1)</strong> .</li>

<p>The relationship between interest rates and the general price level is one that is central to macroeconomic theory; namely that an increase in the rate of interest produces a reduction in the rate of inflation in an economy. Most economists agree on this relationship. Not so, according to President Erdoğan of Turkey, who has defied conventional economic theory in tackling his country’s fundamental economic challenges.</p>
<p>Two economic challenges stand out. There is spiralling inflation and a collapse in the external value of Turkey’s currency (the lira) in the foreign exchange market, as shown in Fig. 1.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/eb13ae84650911efb52f00163e02ecea-1724827874.png" alt="" width="740" height="442"></p>
<p>In January 2022, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices was 48.7%, against a 36.1% yearon-year increase for December 2021. Much higher food prices and transport and energy costs accounted for most of the increase. Despite this rise, the country’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held the short-term interest rate at 14%. This was the rate set in September 2021 when the MPC cut the rate substantially from 19%. In short, the President had used his influence over the MPC to reduce interest rates in an attempt to reduce the increasing rate of inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President’s unconventional approach has had a dramatic effect on the external value of the lira. The rapid depreciation in the value of the lira from September 2021 has had serious repercussions for Turkey’s economy as Mr Erdoğan has sought to prioritise exports over currency stability. Consumer and producer confidence are low; many who can, have converted their lira deposits into US dollars or euros, fearing a collapse of the banking system.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, the President remains adamant that his economics is right for Turkey. Moreover, he is convinced that when exports increase and international tourists return after the COVID-19 pandemic, employment will increase and the current account deficit on the balance of payments will be reduced. If true, this unconventional approach to Turkey’s economic problems will be proved to be a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protectionism is when governments attempt to protect domestic businesses against foreign competition (1). It seeks to reduce the impact of the free market/ restrict free trade (1) by increasing the price competitiveness of domestic businesses against foreign competitors (1).&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>An explanation of how tariffs work (diagram will help although this is not essential) as a method of protectionism i.e., increasing prices of imports and increasing the price competitiveness of domestic businesses. NB: no marks for a diagram unless it is used to explain the impact on the price of imports and how it protects domestic businesses. <strong>Up to 2 marks</strong> e.g., for an explanation of how tariffs increase the price of imports <strong>(1)</strong> and how this protects domestic businesses as it increases their price competitiveness<strong> (1)</strong>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Problems may include possible retaliation, inelastic PED for imports, possible cost push inflationary pressure. <strong>Up to 2 marks</strong> e.g., retaliation by other countries may offset the impact, if the demand for imports is price inelastic then imports may not fall and domestic businesses will not benefit, if the impact is on imported raw materials, this will lead to cost push inflation and domestic businesses who rely on such imports will not benefit.&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Long-run economic growth is likely to need both growth of AD and AS</li>
<li>Analysis of the role of supply side policy in achieving long-run economic growth and its advantages and disadvantages. E.g., supply side policy such as training and education is more likely to increase AS, but this can also lead to an increase in AD, for example as better training leads to an increase in income and therefore an increase in consumer spending. It is also less likely to result in inflation. However, it is costly and will take time.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Analysis of the extent to which supply side policy can lead to growth in both AD and AS. For an explanation that a problem with supply side policy is that it is less effective in directly increasing the level of AD.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Analysis of at least one alternative policy e.g., fiscal policy or monetary policy and how they may achieve long-run economic growth, together with their advantages and disadvantages e.g., fiscal policy such as a reduction in income tax is more likely to increase AD and can be relatively quick. It may also indirectly lead to an increase in AS if more people are encouraged to enter the workforce. However, if AS does not increase, it may be inflationary. It may also reduce the amount available for government spending.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Analysis of the extent to which these policies can lead to growth in both AD and AS. For an explanation that a problem with such policies is that they are less effective in directly increasing the level of AS.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>Minimum wage rates</li>
<li>Transfer payments</li>
<li>Progressive income taxes</li>
<li>State provision of essential goods and services</li>
<li>Investment in infrastructure&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Accept any valid policies but the analysis must focus on how they may be used to redistribute income and wealth and their advantages and disadvantages to be credited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.g., A minimum wage rate that is set above the equilibrium, should increase the income levels of those on the lowest levels and therefore possibly ensure that poverty is reduced. However, if everyone’s income levels increased, this will not have a redistribution effect. It will not impact on the self-employed. It may lead to unemployment and more poverty leading to less redistribution if businesses cannot afford the higher rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.g., Progressive income taxes should ensure that those on lower incomes pay less tax as a percentage of income than those on higher incomes. This should have a redistributive effect. However, those on higher incomes may have the ability to reduce their tax burden or may simply leave the country. It may also reduce incentives to earn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Eurozone consists of 19 European Union (EU) states that have agreed to use a common currency (the euro) and monetary policy, both of which are governed by the ECB. The ECB sets interest rates for all 19 members of the Eurozone and since July 2021 has aimed to maintain the rate of inflation at 2% in the medium term. Interest rates have been held at 0% since March 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/9666f546650211ef81d300163e02ecea-1724824725.png" alt="" width="679" height="297"></p>
<p>In March 2022, the annual rate of inflation hit a record high for the Eurozone of 7.5% and is forecast to continue to rise throughout 2022. Additionally, according to the ECB vice president, annual economic growth is expected to fall from 4.6% at the end of 2021 to around 0% at the end of 2022. Most of the impact of these changes is expected to fall on consumers. Much higher energy costs and rising food prices tend to have a more severe effect on poorer households and those on fixed incomes.</p>
<p>The main causes of the rapid increase in the inflation rate are supply-side factors. The rise in energy prices result from a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine which have reduced supplies of oil and gas. Additionally, the Eurozone labour market is increasingly suffering from a shortage of supply as unemployment has fallen to a record low of 6.8% in February 2022 with further falls predicted. Because the rise in the rate of inflation is almost exclusively supply-side driven, the ECB fears that this will lead to further falls in economic growth leading to a period of ‘stagflation’, where an economy experiences high inflation and low economic growth at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/c0c6d766650211ef81b900163e02ecea-1724824797.png" alt="" width="610" height="294"></p>
<p>All this leaves the ECB with a dilemma. Should it:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase interest rates substantially now to control the increasing rate of inflation and risk weakening economic growth even further, or</li>
<li>increase them slightly in the hope that supply pressure will ease soon (this runs the risk of making high inflation more permanent if the pressure does not ease), or</li>
<li>leave interest rates unchanged?&nbsp;</li>

<p>In May 2022, Sri Lanka had to admit that it was unable to pay its debts to other countries for the first time in its history. As a result, in February 2023 it was forced to obtain a loan of US$3bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The question is now, can Sri Lanka trade its way out of trouble?</p>
<p>The main problem faced by Sri Lanka for many years has been a lack of international competitiveness. Despite a growth in exports between 2000 and 2018, over the same period, they fell as a share of the economy from 39% to 23% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As a result, the country has found itself unable to earn enough foreign currency to pay for essential imports of food and fuel.</p>

<p>For many years, Sri Lanka has enjoyed a comparative advantage in growing and exporting tea. However, the ban on imports of fertilisers in 2021 which cut yields by a fifth and an overreliance on outdated methods of production have had a disastrous impact. Another major export is textiles, but these rely heavily on imported raw materials that have rapidly increased in price following the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. So, what alternatives exist for Sri Lanka?</p>
<p>Unlike in other Asian nations, Sri Lanka does not appear to have a plan to develop any new comparative advantage. Probably the most likely option would appear to be to take full use of its position at the centre of Indian Ocean shipping lanes by developing its ports. Sri Lanka could become a major shipping hub which would extend opportunities for exports. For example, approximately a third of the world’s oil is transported across the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other options include allowing the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate to boost exports because it is felt that the currency is overvalued. There are also suggestions that all import tariffs should be removed. Sri Lanka is currently one of the most protected economies in the World and removing tariffs may help attract much needed foreign investment and encourage local industries to become more efficient.</p>
<p>The question now is, could the introduction of these options lead Sri Lanka back into economic growth?</p>

<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting secondary/tertiary goods/services.</li>
<li>High living standards are generally associated with: low poverty levels; advanced infrastructure; good housing, education and health; and low infant mortality rates.</li>
<li>Economic growth is usually measured by changes in real GDP per capita in a specific time period.</li>
<li>An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita.</li>
<li>Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a high-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The links between an increase in economic growth and an increase in living standards are not clear. Economic growth is a quantitative measure not a qualitative measure</li>
<li>Economic growth which depends upon globalisation would increase long distance transport which would create more negative externalities.</li>
<li>It is not clear how any benefits of economic growth might be used in a high-income economy</li>
<li>Globalisation might lead to an increase in cheap imports from low-income economies which might lead to higher levels of unemployment in more advanced economies.</li>
<li>A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term benefits of globalisation in relation to the improvement of living standards in high-income countries. Also a judgement should consider whether this will <strong>automatically </strong>improve living standards.</li>

<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the use of subsidies and/or decreasing the use of indirect taxation is likely to have a negative effect on a government’s budget. For example, increasing the budget deficit and subsequently increasing the need for more government borrowing.</li>
<li>Removing tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the incomes and output of domestic producers and possibly lead to an increase in unemployment</li>
<li>The introduction of incomes policies is likely to lead to opposition from trade Unions and the possibility of industrial disruption.</li>
<li>Long run supply-side policies are likely to focus on attempts to increase productivity. This frequently involves significant investment in new technology which will lead to a rise in unemployment in the short run</li>
<li>Other policies which might be used in the long run might include immediate investment in skills training and improving the quality of the infrastructure. Skills training is expensive and hence has a high initial opportunity cost. While the immediate effect of an increase in expenditure on improving the infrastructure is likely to increase aggregate demand and add to the inflationary pressure&nbsp;</li>
<li>A conclusion should attempt to assess the relative effectiveness of each type of policy approach and consider which approach is likely to be the most effective in the short run and then compare this with possible outcomes that might be achieved in the long run.</li>

<p>L2 maximum if no accurate diagram provided.</p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the introduction of trade unions might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. Although an increase in productivity might also be produced by substituting capital for labour which might lead to an increase in unemployment.</li>
<li>Trade unions might gain higher wages for labour but because this makes capital relatively cheaper, machines might be substituted for labour which will further reduce employment.</li>
<li>The impact of higher wages on employment will also depend upon how easy it is to substitute capital for labour and the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry.</li>
<li>If trade unions manage to bargain for higher wages but the new wage is above the market equilibrium, there will be an excess supply of labour at the new wage leading to higher unemployment. The extent of this impact will be determined by the relative elasticities of supply of and demand for labour</li>

<p>In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.</p>
<p>Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.</p>
<p>The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.</p>
<p>A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.</p>
<p>In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.</p>
<p>Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Identify what caused the rise in the electricity prices and explain whether it can be concluded from the article that the price rise was an example of market failure.</strong></p>
<p>Natural gas supply shortage (1) breakdown of nuclear reactors (1). <br>Market failure occurs when price mechanism fails to account for all of the costs and benefits necessary to determine price equilibrium and this results in allocative inefficiency (accept alternative definitions of market failure) (2). There is no evidence of allocative inefficiency and no market failure (accept either) (1).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is there any evidence in the article that the French government’s decisions will increase competition or efficiency in the energy market?</strong></p>
<p>Competitors got cheaper electricity, so this maybe increases competition (1). Alternative renewable energy projects were stopped, so possibly leading to less efficiency (1). Five reactors were forced to close due to poor maintenance and becoming less efficient (1). The reactors enabled selfsufficiency so this is now less likely. <br>Conclusion: some evidence of increasing competition, no evidence of increasing efficiency (1). Accept fall in monopoly profits might lead to a fall in dynamic efficiency (1).</p>

<p>Cannot show that changes in price are linked to any notion of fairness, in relation to producer (1). Therefore, producer equity will be unaffected (1). A tax cut might increase consumer equity (1). <br>Explanation (1) equality possibly, consumer rescued from excessive price increase (1) but as both rich and poor consumer benefit it is not conclusive that consumer equality is improved (1). <br>Small firms will get cheaper electricity at the expense of large firms and this suggests an increase in equality between producers might be obtained (2). <br>However, a cut in electricity taxes might benefit the large electricity company more than its smaller rivals, therefore any conclusion on the impact of equality for producers might remain uncertain (2).</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a form of technological progress. It involves computers or computercontrolled robots engaging in tasks usually performed by humans. Many businesses invest in AI to reduce their costs, to increase their efficiency by reducing human errors and to raise business revenues and profits.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process – from increased use of contactless card payment systems to large-scale investment in driverless taxis. In China, a leading internet search company plans to follow some of its rivals in the United States (US) by starting a driverless taxi service in 100 cities by 2030.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the pace of growth in AI has raised concerns that this will result in increased unemployment. One study suggests that up to 38% of US jobs are at risk from automation by the mid-2030s. To date, Japan has between 200 and 300 AI companies. It is also the leading supplier of industrial robots and third, behind China and the US, in spending on research and development into AI.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, the growth of the internet created similar fears. Despite these concerns, the technology created millions of jobs and contributed as much as 10.5% towards US GDP in 2020. As a result, some economists suggest that the movement towards AI will fundamentally change the world and the way we work and live but will not lead to large rises in unemployment. AI technology may create more jobs than it destroys.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the danger remains that automation will lead to a society of winners and losers. These newly created jobs will require new skills and significant investment in training young people and retraining adults. Therefore, governments may need to implement targeted policies to ensure that any changes to structural unemployment are only short-lived. However, rising national debt alongside projections of low economic growth, as shown in Table 1.1, may reduce the ability of governments to deliver such policies.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Aid can be defined as any assistance given to a country that would not be provided through normal market forces.</li>
<li>There are two main types of aid, humanitarian aid; development aid. Development aid would include many different types including: long term loans; tied aid; bilateral aid and multilateral aid.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.</li>
<li>Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population grow.</li>
<li>Aid that focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.</li>
<li>Aid can increase real wealth and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The links between an increase in aid and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes aid only reaches a relatively small section of the population. For example, due to corruption.</li>
<li>Different types of aid might produce different outcomes. For example, aid in the form of long-term loans might make it more difficult for low-income countries to escape the cycle of poverty.</li>
<li>Aid is sometimes given for political reasons rather than the low-income countries where the need is the greatest.</li>
<li>Tied aid might mean that low--income countries receiving such aid have to purchase goods and services from the donor country which are more expensive.</li>
<li>Long term dependency upon aid might lead to a welfare mentality and reduce levels of innovation in the low-income country.</li>
<li>A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term efficacy of development aid in relation to the improvement of living standards in low-income countries.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fiscal policy would require a government to use taxation and government expenditure changes to influence key macroeconomic goals such as inflation, economic growth and the level of employment.</li>
<li>An output gap will show the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.</li>
<li>A negative output will indicate that there is spare capacity in an economy which will be primarily due to insufficient aggregate monetary demand. A relevant diagram can be used to illustrate this gap.</li>
<li>Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to significantly influence aggregate demand by either increase its expenditure or reducing the overall level of taxation.</li>
<li>A budget deficit will inject additional demand into an economy which will have a magnified effect on output, income and employment due to the positive contribution of a multiplier effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal policy could help to close a negative output gap by increasing a government’s budget deficit but this may lead to higher interest rates and crowding out in the private sector.</li>
<li>It is difficult for a government to produce an accurate forecast of the magnitude of the output gap.</li>
<li>Although a budget deficit might help to reduce a negative output gap in the short run, if the deficit is financed by increasing the money supply, this might lead to inflation in the long run.</li>
<li>Alternative policies such as supply-side policies might be more effective by closing the output gap while avoiding the risk of inflation in the long run.</li>
<li>Expansionary fiscal policies used to close an output gap might lead to an increase in the demand for imports and subsequently, a negative impact on the country’s balance of payments.</li>
<li>While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.</li>
<li>The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.</li>
<li>It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.</li>
<li>Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximisation and this might lead to these firms focusing upon private costs and ignoring social cost.</li>
<li>The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all market inefficiency because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.</li>
<li>The use of minimum prices would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.</li>
<li>Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.</li>
<li>A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces. Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.</li>

<p>South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.</p>
<p>Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.</p>
<p>Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/5aa1be60c34a11ee81b900163e02ecea-1707043461.png" alt="" width="393" height="268"></p>
<p>This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.</p>
<p>Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth. The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.</p>
<p>For South Africa’s economy to grow it needs to address major infrastructure issues. Also, in disadvantaged communities the education system is weak contributing to a skills shortage and a rise in the unemployment rate to 27% (see Fig. 1.2). Increased production is further hindered by restrictive trade union practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/a4991ec8c34a11ee930a00163e02ecea-1707043585.png" alt="" width="429" height="248"><br><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/ac95b1f4c34a11eea72600163e02ecea-1707043598.png" alt="" width="477" height="255"></p>
<p>An analyst said: ‘A critical reason for low economic growth has been a lack of private sector investment and FDI (see Fig. 1.3). The lack of investment wasn’t just due to the political policies but also to uncertainty and mismanagement which led to continued inequalities.’</p>

<p><strong>Assess the evidence provided about the significance of the performance of the state-owned electricity monopoly as a contributor to the decline in South Africa’s economy.</strong></p>
<p>Electricity supply is fundamental to the functioning of an economy. The company has been unable to meet national demand for electricity and has used power cuts to ration consumption. (1)</p>
<p>Article mentions other industries in decline but states that the electricity company is the biggest threat. (1)</p>
<p>Lack of electricity has had an effect on the outputs of mining and manufacturing that have led to unemployment. (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>General uncertainty has led to reduced investment and has also contributed to the situation that South Africa’s actual growth is well below its potential growth in view of its well-endowed natural resources. (1)</p>
<p>No similar figures for the other industries so a definite conclusion about the exact significance of the electricity industry is not possible. (1)</p>

<p><strong>Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy.</strong></p>
<p>Various government reforms and poor performances of some state industries have undermined confidence in the entire South African economy. (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by the lack of investment by the private sector in the mining industry leading to increasing unemployment. (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South African economy has also been diminished in the international economy as indicated by the fall in FDI (Figure 3) (1)</p>
<p>High unemployment means low consumer expenditure and low growth in AD. (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future prospects</span> for improvement seem limited in the short run (1). Longer term it needs to overcome a skills shortage by reforming education (1) and restrictive trade union practices. (1) Nevertheless, there is some increase in FDI (1). Longer term increase in infrastructure (1). An increase in employment/economic growth in the economy (1)</p>

<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of GNI: the total income earned within a country in a year plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production. This is an aggregate measure of an economy’s income.</li>
<li>GNI measures in monetary terms.</li>
<li>For many developing countries which rely on remittances from overseas workers, this will boost the value of GNI.</li>
<li>Other countries that have invested overseas will receive a stream of dividends and interest that boosts their GNI.</li>
<li>Definition of the MPI</li>
<li>Some explicit breakdown of the categories which are involved in the construction of MPI</li>
<li>Health: 1/3rd weighting includes child mortality and nutrition (1/6th each);</li>
<li>Education: 1/3rd weighting includes years of schooling and school attendance (1/6th each); and</li>
<li>Standard of living 1/3 weighting includes cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing and assets (1/18th each).</li>
<li>The measures are fundamentally different in their approaches GNI is concerned with money values whilst MPI is concerned with the adequacy of provision of a number of essential services and goods linked to the Millennium Development Goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation may be by individual measure or by comparing the measures.</p>
<ul>
<li>GNI The comprehensiveness of the data collection:&nbsp;</li>
<li>The GNI figures needs deflating for the effects of price increases and changes in the population to achieve real GNI per head, which allows for comparisons over time.</li>
<li>The range of incomes which are included ‘the dark economy’, illegal activity – drugs crime etc. the ability to count all income flows between countries.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Incomes from activities that produce negative externalities or are the result of monopoly profits increase the GNI but reduce the level of economic efficiency.</li>
<li>Real GNI per head can be used as a simple measure of economic growth but lacks a distributional measure. <br>Additional measures such as the Gini coefficient need to be calculated to gain a measure of the distributional effect of a given GNI. Both these measures are averages which disguise a wide range of individual circumstances.</li>
<li>The data collection for MPI is more complex than for GNI. The criteria for GNI are well established and are given.</li>
<li>Monetary-based poverty measures can omit a lot. The overlap between monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty is not perfect. In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.</li>
<li>Economic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation. Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.</li>
<li>Real GNI per head data is available for 188 (most) countries of the world whilst MPI data is only available for 103 poorer countries.&nbsp;</li>
<li>MPI for education measures inputs not outputs, attending school is not the same as learning to read</li>

<li><strong>Consumer rationality:</strong> indifference analysis assumes that consumers act rationally. They are of a calculating mind, carrying numerous combinations of different commodities in their heads, can substitute one for the other, compare their total utilities and make a rational choice between various combinations of goods.</li>
<li>As the effect of a reduction in price is an increase in demand for both a normal and inferior good (except in the case of Giffen good) it is not possible to know whether a good is normal or inferior.</li>
<li>It is difficult to apply the concept of substitutability to goods such as consumable durables, which are one-off indivisible purchases and the choice is between, for example, 1 fridge and 4 weeks’ food.</li>
<li>A consumer is faced with a much more complex world than the two-good world of the model because a consumer buys not just two but a large number of commodities to satisfy their innumerable wants.</li>
<li>IC analysis is a static analysis and consumer preferences may change over time.</li>

<p><strong>Indicative content</strong><br>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.</li>
<li>High-income countries are likely to benefit from access to a wide range of goods and services and access to good health care and education.</li>
<li>Comparative advantage allows high-income countries to increase their standard of living by providing access to cheap raw materials produced in low-income countries.</li>
<li>Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assess the contribution of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the improvement of the standard of living in low-income countries.</strong></p>
<p>Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and<br>Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.</p>

<p><strong>Indicative content</strong></p>
<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.</li>
<li>This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.</li>
<li>Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.</li>
<li>An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.</li>
<li>FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a lowincome economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.</li>
<li>More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The links between globalization and the costs/benefits imposed on lowincome countries is not clear. For example, low-income countries might benefit significantly from the transfer of new technology from high income countries.</li>
<li>Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore helping to train the indigenous population.</li>
<li>Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth which can then be used to provide merit goods such as health care and education.</li>
<li>In some cases, individual firms in low-income countries might gain access to large markets in high-income countries which will subsequently allow new businesses to grow</li>
<li>In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to benefit both high and low-income countries, but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall positive impact.</li>

<li>The effectiveness of monetary policy is likely to depend to some extent upon the cause of unemployment. Monetary policy can be used to influence aggregate monetary demand which will be more effective dealing with cyclical unemployment.</li>

<p><strong>Indicative content</strong></p>
<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between public and private ownership should be clearly explained.</li>
<li>Health care should be identified as a merit good and the significance of merit goods explained.</li>
<li>The links between a merit good, positive externalities and allocative efficiency should be analysed.</li>
<li>Analysis of the relationship between the public provision of health care and efficient outcomes should be provided.</li>
<li>Analysis of the possible causes of inefficiency relating to the provision of health care by the public sector</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Private providers of health care are unlikely to provide an allocatively efficient level of health care because of a failure to take into account the additional benefits of positive externalities.</li>
<li>Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximization and this might lead to a higher cost of receiving health care.</li>
<li>If access to health care in the private sector is based on an ability to pay, this might create inequitable outcomes in society.</li>
<li>The pursuit of profit might lead private firms to cut costs and reduce any unnecessary bureaucracy thus leading to a more efficient use of scarce resources.</li>
<li>The substitution of public provision by private provision might enable additional resources to become available in the public sector.</li>
<li>A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative ie private or public sector provision of health care.</li>
<li>Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.</li>

<p>In 2020, Japan suffered its third quarterly decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in a row. The size of its real GDP shrank to its lowest level since 2011 when the country was suffering from 20 years of deflation and economic stagnation. In 2020, the economy was not helped by a previous increase in sales tax, the COVID-19 pandemic and the trade war between the world's biggest economies, the United States (US) and China.

<p>In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the global economy was facing its worst recession since the world depression in the 1930s. Japan's economy shrank by 7.8% between April and June of 2020, while the US economy contracted by 9.5% and China's by 3.2%.</p>
<p>Japan, which was the world's fourth largest exporter, incurred an overall trade deficit of US$15.2 billion for 2019, an increase of almost 50% on the trade deficit for 2018. In 2020, exports fell by a further 18.5% in the third quarter, mainly caused by a decline in Japan's motor vehicle exports. In that quarter, its main car producer, one of the world's biggest car companies, made its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as sales halved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government of Japan used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to try to stimulate the economy. Low interest rates had been used by the central bank since 2016. In August 2020, economists said that despite this stimulus to encourage growth there was a chance economic activity may stagnate even further if major nations again adopted more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to combat any reoccurrence of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Up to 4 marks for theory response<br>Up to 4 marks for application of data</p>
<p>In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)</p>
<p>In theory the low interest rates should discourage saving and increased consumption but the pattern of retail sales seems to contradict this expectation. (2)</p>
<p>Also, low interest rates should encourage borrowing for industrial investment to expand capital assets but industrial production has declined significantly after 2017 (2)</p>
<p>Policy appears to have worked best in 2017 when industrial production and retail sales improved significantly linked to the highest rate of economic growth year-on-year.</p>
<p>However the fall in exports, trade wars (US − China) and high levels of public debt have continued to lead to more stagnation. This has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 (2)</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a very significant impact on the global economy in 2020. Negative economic growth rates were recorded for all major economies. The speed, unexpected and unprecedented nature of the downturns has been devastating for businesses, governments and populations. Individual economies reacted to the pandemic differently. Fig. 1.1 shows quarterly economic growth rates in 2020 for four selected countries compared to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) average.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/4bf6ffa0c32811eea72600163e02ecea-1707028833.png" alt="" width="610" height="270"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1 Annual change to quarterly gross domestic product (GDP)</strong><br><strong>in selected countries in 2020 compared to the OECD average.</strong></p>
<p>China's economic performance in 2020 was the exception. China was the first country to experience the pandemic. It has also been the first economy to recover from recession, a period of two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The Chinese government was quick to enforce lockdowns to limit the pandemic and there was rapidly increasing demand for exports of PPE (personal protection equipment) and other Chinese-made products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case of neighbouring South Korea was different. Like China, the impact of the pandemic was more effectively contained than in other economies and growth in South Korea’s economy was less affected. There was, however, little evidence in the data that by the end of 2020, South Korea’s economy would recover to its pre-2019 position of strong economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The economies of the US and the UK had negative quarterly economic growth throughout 2020. Economists in these countries have disagreed about how best to increase the rate of economic growth after the pandemic. The governments of both countries introduced very high government spending programmes to encourage the return to economic growth in 2021. However, monetary policies have been widely promoted by many economists as an alternative to more traditional fiscal measures.</p>

<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of the concept of price elasticity of supply may explain its use in increasing a business' total sales by examining the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usefulness depends on the type of goods and whether decisions need to be made in the short run or long run.</li>
<li>It may help businesses with regards to stock holding and decisions about which products to focus on</li>
<li>It may help businesses make decisions about productive capacity and whether e.g., to invest in new technology BUT</li>
<li>It depends on the accuracy of the data used to produce the value.</li>
<li>This may change over time and the value may have little value in a growing economy.</li>
<li>Some products, such as agricultural/perishable products, will naturally have a more price inelastic supply and knowledge of the value may have little use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis of the concept of cross elasticity of demand may explain its use in increasing a business’s total revenue by examining the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will mean the business understands the relationship between its product and others i.e., whether they are complements or substitutes.</li>
<li>It also measures the closeness of the relationship and informs decisions about how quickly and the extent to which it should react for example if a competitor changes its prices.</li>
<li>It should assist a business to develop a pricing strategy that maximises opportunities to generate more sales BUT</li>
<li>The usefulness depends on the accuracy of the data and in a growing economy, it may not be possible to keep the value up to date. It is therefore often dependent on estimates that may be inaccurate.</li>
<li>Businesses may not be able to act on the data by changing prices if their cost structure cannot be easily changed.</li>
<li>Other variables other than cross elasticity of demand may be more important for example non price determinants such as brand loyalty.</li>

<p>Oil companies are facing uncertainty in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic causes a collapse in demand for their product, but car producers are predicting the pandemic will help accelerate the use of electric cars.

<p>However, the rise of electric car sales could slow within the next few years due to a worldwide shortage of the supply of lithium needed for car batteries. Demand for lithium could triple by 2025 to one million tonnes per year and then double again to two million tonnes per year by 2030. A typical lithium mine produces 30000 tonnes per year which means the market needs approximately four new mines per year to meet demand. However, it usually takes about six years to discover, develop and put a lithium mine into production.</p>
<p>Rising global sales of electric cars are impacting on world oil producers. The boom years for the oil industry are over as economies start to deal with climate change. This will have significant implications for petrostates (countries whose economies are almost totally reliant on oil and gas).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Volatile oil prices, as illustrated in Table 1.1, have already left many petrostate governments struggling. The governments of most Middle Eastern oil producing countries cannot maintain a balanced budget at the 2020 average oil price of around US$40. Years of unstable oil revenues have left these countries with significant levels of national debt.</p>
<p>Venezuela offers a cautionary tale. Serious mismanagement has caused its oil output in 2020 to drop to about 10% of its 2000 level. Gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen by more than 75% in the past 5 years and more than 5 million people have left the country.</p>
<p>The solution is diversification. Wealthy Middle East states, such as Oman and Saudi Arabia, are investing in renewable energy and international tourism. Attempts at change by less wealthy petrostates such as Venezuela are hampered by a lack of capital at home and because they are often unable to attract international investors. As a result, they tend to focus on short-term rather than long-term economic growth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many petrostates are likely to need outside support to diversify their economies. In addition to financial aid, it is suggested that wealthy countries should also offer technical assistance such as retraining workers, help designing new tax systems and support with the adoption of renewable energy.</p>

<p>The shortage of lithium may be caused by a fall in its supply or an increase in its demand (not matched by an increase in its supply).

<p><strong>Assess whether diversification is likely to be more successful in Venezuela or Saudi Arabia as they reduce their dependence on oil production.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Up to 4 marks for the explanation/analysis</strong><br>Answers should analyse the extent of the likely success of diversification for both economies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 3 marks for valid analysis for Venezuela</li>
<li>Up to 3 marks for valid analysis for Saudi Arabia<strong> (with a maximum of 4 </strong><strong>marks overall)</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>that considers why the success of diversification may differ in <strong>each </strong>case.</li>
<li>and reaches a justified conclusion as to which country's economic growth is most likely to be impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guidance</strong></span><br>Clearly, according to the extract, the common problem for both economies is the forecast fall in oil demand led by the need to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change. However, as the data also makes clear, the impact of this will be different for countries such as Saudi Arabia and countries such as Venezuela, and the analysis and evaluation must refer to these differences for full marks. Points to consider from the extract may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The relative wealth and access to both internal and external capital</li>
<li>The relative focus on short- and long-term growth</li>
<li>The relative ease of diversifying e.g., Saudi Arabia has already begun investing in renewable energy and tourism, whereas Venezuela is suffering high rates of emigration and lacks the funds to do so.</li>
<li>The possible difference in the willingness of other economies to offer the needed support to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela respectively and the possible difference in the receptiveness to any aid offered.</li>

<p>In 2021, Taiwan's economy is forecast to grow at its fastest rate in seven years, encouraged by increasing global demand for its technology products. Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise by 4.6% in 2021.</p>
<p>Exports from Taiwan's electronics industry include gaming devices, laptops, devices that aid cloud computing and semiconductors for car production. Taiwan is able to take advantage of a global shortage of semiconductors and it is estimated that exports will grow by 9.6% in 2021, the strongest export growth since 2017. A Taiwanese company is the world's largest producer of semiconductors, and it plans to increase its capital investment by as much as US$28 billion in 2021 to help meet the shortage of semiconductors.</p>
<p>Consumption expenditure in Taiwan is also expected to grow by 3.7% in 2021 which would be the fastest rate of growth in 17 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is significant that the expected growth in GDP in 2021 is higher than the expected rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI), as is shown in Table 1.1.</p>

<p>The growth in the demand for Taiwan's exports has contributed to an appreciation of more than 7% in the Taiwan dollar against the US dollar during 2020. Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$58.8 billion in 2020 and this is expected to rise to US$63.9 billion in 2021. This increase is likely to appreciate the value of the Taiwan dollar further.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC or MSB = MSC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Negative externalities occur when the when the consumption/use of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that received by an individual producer MPB &gt; MSB or MSC &gt;MPC. This is sometimes described as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect. The negative externality leads to an over production of the good.</li>
<li>Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-consumption of a good or service.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies for consumers to increase consumption and also producers to change production methods, use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services such as alternative transport methods. Indirect taxation. Nudge theory effects.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive/negative externality on the level of output and the welfare change will be identified.</li>
<li>The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a negative consumption externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the negative externality is taken into account. The diagram may be amended or re-drawn to show the impact of a chosen policy(ies) and the impact on consumption or production shown.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Reference to the diagram and the outcomes it illustrates is made in the text.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.&nbsp;</li>

<p>The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.</p>
<p>Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.</p>
<p>Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.</p>
<p>The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>

<li>Low – income countries might increase productivity due the transfer of new technology from high income countries, however this might lead to a substitution of capital for labour thus increasing the level of unemployment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) might lead to the exploitation of the indigenous raw materials, thus leading to a long run decline in economic growth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increases in productivity might provide opportunities to create more real wealth but it will still depend upon a government in a low – income country to ensure that any increases in wealth lead to equitable outcomes.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>The links between an increase in FDI and GDP and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by MNCs in lowincome countries. The majority of MNC profit might be repatriated rather than re – invested in the low re – income country.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Higher skilled work might be provided separately by the MNC therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place. In some cases it has been argued that MNCs extract key resources and then leave.</li>
<li>It is not certain that a government will use the increase in tax revenue to invested in key sectors such as health, education and the country’s infrastructure.&nbsp;</li>
<li>es in productivity in relation to services such as health and education.</li>
<li>A government in a low-income economy has to decide whether to allow FDI into their economy which might produce short – term benefits but result in long re – term consequences of resource depletion in the long run.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is very difficult to measure changes in living standards. Increases in GDP might not be divided equally among the population. FDIs might introduce external costs of production which are likely to have a negative effect on overall living standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for FDIs to improve   living standards but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negative impact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not focus entirely on an increase in access to material goods and services.</li>

<li>The use of relevant labelled diagrams (not mandatory)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>If firms are rational profit – maximisers, the firms must benefit from their action therefore the initial point that the producer will always benefit is true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As total spending on the good / service takes place this represents a transfer of consumer surplus to the producers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it depends on whether the firms gain at the expense of consumer and society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the price discrimination exists between domestic and foreign markets The producer may also be able to drive competition from the foreign market if it charges high domestic prices / recovers overheads domestically. This may improve a country’s balance of payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some consumers gain and some lose. The lower price in the low PED market will benefit those consumers in that market whilst the opposite occurs in the High PED market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in profits may allow the producer to increase its research and development leading to innovative production techniques which lower long term costs – dynamic efficiency. The benefits of the dynamic efficiency may be enjoyed by consumers / society as lower prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment of the statement should conclude with the view that it should benefit the producer as a matter of rationality but whether this is always at the expense of consumers / society is debateable. Accept all valid responses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of subsidies to encourage the provision of education in the private sector might not be entirely successful because of the difficulties involved when attempting to assess the precise level of subsidy required to achieve an allocatively efficient outcome.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Subsidies provided by the public sector are often expensive and their use will automatically create opportunity costs. For example, money spent on state subsidies to health care&nbsp;</li>
<li>Subsidies in the private sector will mean that access to education is still based on an ability to pay, this might create inequitable outcomes in society.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The pursuit of profit supported by subsidies might enable private firms to cut costs and reduce any unnecessary bureaucracy thus leading to a more efficient use of scarce resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Direct state provision of education might lead to less efficient outcomes and reduce the time taken to ensure a high standard of education is available on an equal basis throughout the population.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. private or public sector provision of education.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output / consumption is reached&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities, but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good / service under consideration.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Firms are sometimes thought of as machines: inputs go in, products come out. However, it matters how powerful these firms are allowed to become.</p>
<p>Competition law – the law that governs how firms compete in the market, how they may exert their power and how and when they may join forces – has not prevented high concentration ratios in many industries.</p>
<p>Global monopolies have been created in the name of ‘free market’ capitalism. Mergers have been approved and monopolies tolerated under the assumption that they are efficient. Their ability to enable innovation is relied upon to justify these monopolised industries.</p>
<p>Competition law is being used to protect a narrow set of public interests based on the idea of ‘consumer welfare’. The test applied by the law is whether any change will result in lower prices for consumers and thus is beneficial. This is regardless of how monopolised the resulting market structure becomes.</p>
<p>The logic that focuses on consumer prices is flawed. This can be seen in the impacts of firms on the environment. Prices do not capture the negative externalities of production, for which neither the producer nor the consumer pays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low consumer prices are not an adequate indicator for consumer welfare. The low price/low wage spiral keeps pushing for cheaper goods and services to increase the profitability of the firm. The result is that workers are paid less. Low prices cause unequal bargaining positions between powerful employers and workers, and between powerful buyers and small independent suppliers.</p>
<p>Regulation has a role to play in protecting consumers from the worst abuses of market power by firms. There needs, however, to be new competition law that promotes the free market rather than the desires of the monopoly firms. It needs to consider the balance of power between the public sector and private enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The article refers to concentration ratios. Explain what is meant by a concentration ratio and how it is calculated.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The concentration ratio is the sum of the market share percentage held by the largest specified number of firms in an industry. It ranges from 0% to 100%, and an indicates the degree of competition in the industry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Low concentration ratio</span> in an industry would indicate greater competition among the firms in that industry. (2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is calculated by adding together the total sales for each of the specified number of largest firms in the industry. (E.g. a 4 firm concentration ration takes the sales of the largest 4 firms) That sum is then divided by the total sales of the industry and converted to a percentage. (2)&nbsp;</p>

<li>it results in unequal bargaining power between employers and workers. Workers have little scope for arguing for pay rises.</li>
<li>it allows an unequal negotiation between large organisations and small independent suppliers. Large organisations can insist on low purchasing prices and small suppliers have limited power to resist. This has been noticeable in large supermarkets dealings with small farmers.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Consumers love to eat doughnuts. In 2019, 10 billion of these deep-fried sugar-coated products were consumed in the United States (US). Fig. 1.1 shows that the US market increased steadily from 2011 to 2019. Doughnuts are widely available throughout the US. There are specialist shops selling their branded products almost everywhere; local coffee shops invariably sell ‘hole in one’ doughnuts as a popular breakfast snack to tempt consumers on their way to work. The growing number of shops selling doughnuts has been an important reason behind overall market growth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1 Doughnut market size in the US, 2011 to 2021&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a varying impact on the US doughnut market. Despite having less income, many consumers have continued to buy small luxuries such as doughnuts which remain affordable and can provide some short-term relief from the stresses of the pandemic. Overall, sales of doughnuts fell in 2020 and are forecast to remain below their 2019 peak into 2021. Reasons for this fall in demand are that consumers are making fewer shopping trips and in cities, more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom (UK), more so than in the US, there are growing concerns about the increase in sugar consumption amongst children. This increase comes from soft drinks, chocolate biscuits and sweets (candy) as well as from jam-filled doughnuts, all of which are widely available in supermarkets and local convenience stores. In 2021, it was estimated that a third of teenagers and two thirds of adults in the UK were overweight. This has increased the pressure on the UK government to end online advertising of a range of products including doughnuts. It has been estimated that viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories. Moreover, a ban on advertising sugary foods would result in children consuming the equivalent of 62 million fewer doughnuts a year in the UK.</p>

<p>Maximum of 2 marks if only demand-pull inflation is considered and should focus on the impact of the fall in price of exports and the rise in the price of imports and the possible impact on the X -M component of AD and therefore the impact on AD overall. Reference may be made to the PED of exports and the PED of imports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maximum of 2 marks if only cost push inflation is considered. Reference must be made to the importance of imports (1) and the fact that this country has few natural resources which probably means they must be imported for the 2nd mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)</strong> <br>For an answer that clearly considers the fact that this country has few natural resources <strong>(1)</strong> to come to a justified conclusion as to which type of inflation is most likely to be the outcome for a country with few natural resources <strong>(1)</strong></p>

<p><strong>AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: there are two possible approaches to answering this question. If both the approach focused on demand-side (inferior and normal goods) and the supply-side approach are attempted, then only the best response should be marked including marks for evaluation.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>EITHER:</strong> <br>The demand curve will be expected to shift in this situation.

<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis (max 8 marks)</strong><br>The advantages of encouraging entrepreneurship include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that entrepreneurs are the ones who organise the other three factors of production to produce output in an economy.</li>
<li>They are the ones who take risks and in return receive profit which is the motivation to be successful and so stimulate economic growth.</li>
<li>The fact that entrepreneurs must be creative and innovative to succeed and therefore should have the skills to anticipate current and future needs to be successful and therefore increase the productive potential of an economy and thus stimulate long run economic growth e.g., as measured by a shift to the right of the PPC.</li>
<li>Modern economies are dynamic, ever changing and the need to respond quickly to changes is one that can be met by successful entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There may be a cost in training and educating future entrepreneurs.</li>
<li>The rate of success of a policy to increase entrepreneurship may be low</li>
<li>The success depends on other factors such as the availability of government subsidies etc. which have an opportunity cost as well as the availability and quality of the other factors of production,</li>
<li>Because of high risks, entrepreneurs may seek short run gain which may not encourage long run economic growth and may in fact make it less likely e.g., due to rapid depletion of scarce resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be compared with the likely importance and the advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) of increasing <strong>one </strong>other factor of production i.e., land <strong>OR</strong> labour <strong>OR</strong> capital.

<p>Nigeria has about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of young people in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.</p>
<p>Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic, particularly due to the steep decline in oil prices. Nationally, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, while another 25% are vulnerable and could fall into poverty due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria’s export revenues, a dominant position that it has occupied since the 1970s. Many people believe that Nigeria needs to move further away from its dependence on oil and natural gas. Initial attempts at diversification have produced limited gains as the policies have been aimed mainly at the domestic market to create jobs and to improve living standards. There needs to be a focus on export‑orientated manufacturing that should boost economic growth as it has done in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of these countries, more open trade and competition policies would help to diversify the economy, especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) takes effect. Nigeria needs to create at least five million new jobs each year to employ its growing population of young people.</p>

<p>Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 2020 due to fall in crude oil prices caused by falling global demand and measures to fight the spread of COVID‑19. Inflation rose in 2020 due mainly to higher food prices, the removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in the price of electricity. The budget deficit also worsened in 2020 because the COVID‑19 pandemic caused higher government spending and lower tax revenues, adding to the national debt.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s national debt is sustainable at 25% of GDP, but interest payments are high, accounting for about 50% of government spending. Nigeria’s government could improve its finances by reforming domestic tax collection. Non‑oil tax revenue is equivalent to just 4% of GDP. An increase in the rate of value‑added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 resulted in less revenue than forecast because of the recession. A wider tax base could help the budget, but this will require significant reform to reduce both tax evasion and a large informal economy.</p>

<p>Changes in the rate of unemployment in India between July 2020 and May 2021 can be seen in Fig. 1.1.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1: India's unemployment rate, July 2020 to May 2021&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>India's unemployment rate rose in December 2020, reaching a six-month high. The fact that the unemployment rate has been rising during this period, despite an economic recovery, has raised concerns among economists at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) research institute in Mumbai, although they recognise that there are possible difficulties in the measurement of unemployment.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the increase in unemployment in December 2020 is an increase in frictional unemployment. According to CMIE, India’s labour force increased from 421 million in November 2020 to 427 million in December 2020 and the majority of these new workers were unable to find work immediately. Many of these people are reluctant to relocate to take jobs and others are unaware of job vacancies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another reason for this increase in unemployment in India is because of seasonal unemployment. One of the main reasons behind rising unemployment has been the failure of the agricultural sector to absorb the additional labour. One economist at CMIE has stated: ‘Farming is the last resort of many who are without work. However, December is not the month in which farming can absorb labour. This is the month when it needs fewer workers. In December 2020, the job losses from agriculture were 9.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The economists at CMIE stated that the rise in unemployment in certain months was not a good sign for the Indian economy as it could lead to higher income inequality and poverty.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primarygoods.</li>
<li>Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.</li>
<li>An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to beachieved.</li>
<li>Globalization through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard ofliving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The links between globalisation and GDP and an increase in living standards in low-income countries are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by more advanced, higher income countries. inlow- income countries</li>
<li>Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries</li>
<li>Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place.</li>
<li>In somecases, individual firms in low-income countries might be outcompeted and go out of business. Unemployment might then rise and living standards might fall.</li>
<li>In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to improve the standard of living but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negativeimpact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not rely entirely on the material benefits gained by globalisation.</li>

<li>Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome thatachieves allocative efficiency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.</li>
<li>Forms of government intervention might include: the use of taxation; the use of negative advertising, direct regulation</li>
<li>A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a negative externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.</li>
<li>The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not recognize the existence of a negative externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of flight use when the negative externality is taken into account.</li>
<li>One type of intervention might involve the use of taxation by a government. A tax will increase the cost of air travel which will decrease demand. A decrease in demand will decrease the equilibrium number of flights and achieve allocative efficiency.</li>
<li>A government might use negative advertising to decrease demand. A decrease in demand will lead to fewer flight, volume of air travel will fall and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A government might introduce a tax however it is difficult to measure the precise level of taxation required.</li>
<li>Also, the impact of a tax on price and demand in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly, and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of consumption is reached&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities, but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.</li>

<p>Politicians do not usually think it a success to borrow a large amount of money but, in June 2020, when the economy was approaching a recession, the United Kingdom (UK) borrowed five times as much as it did in June 2019. This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./AL Econ MS only_files/9e6f6b04ff6611edae3200163e02ecea-1685505172.png" alt="" width="523" height="245"></p>
<p>Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.</p>
<p>However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.</p>

<p>If the government borrows to fund the expenditure it may have to sell bonds to the private sector (1).

<p>Successful supply-side policies will cause a rightward shift in the long-run AS curve, reflecting more efficient production. This would make a country’s products more competitive in international markets and so there is likely to be an increase in net exports, correcting a deficit in the current account. Supply-side policies could include improvements in training and education, making labour markets more flexible, reductions in the powers of trade unions, an increase in competition and a reduction in rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Potential disadvantages of supply-side policies are that they are essentially a long-run solution and so may take a relatively long period of time to have an impact, such as improvements in training and education. Some of the policies could be quite expensive and so would involve the government in considerable expenditure, money which could have spent elsewhere (giving rise to the issue of opportunity cost).</p>
<p><strong>Guidance:</strong> There are a number of alternative approaches to answering this question. At the simplest level, analysis and evaluation may focus on an assessment of the effectiveness of supply side policies only. Furthermore, this may be expanded to include a direct comparison with the effectiveness of alternative policies such as fiscal, monetary or protectionist policies. In addition, such an assessment may simply be part of evaluation. However, if supply side policies are ignored or receive scant attention then only a Level 2 mark may be awarded.</p>
<p><strong>A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong><br>Points to consider may include:<br>the cause of the deficit, the cost and ease of introducing various policies, the possible unintended consequences of introducing policies etc. leading to a justified conclusion as to whether supply-side policies would be the most effective way to correct a deficit in the current account of the balance of payments of an economy.</p>

<p><strong>Indicative content</strong></p>
<p>Responses may include:</p>
<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.</li>
<li>This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.</li>
<li>Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.</li>
<li>Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.</li>
<li>An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.</li>
<li>FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a low-income economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.</li>
<li>More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country's government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.</li>
<li>However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The links between an increase in FDI and GDP and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by MNCs in lowincome countries. The majority of MNC profit might be repatriated rather than re-invested in the low-income country.</li>
<li>Higher skilled work might be provided separately by the MNC therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place. In some cases it has been argued that MNCs extract key resources and then leave.</li>
<li>It is not certain that a government will use the increase in tax revenue to invested in key sectors such as health, education and the country's infrastructure.</li>
<li>A government in a low-income economy has to decide whether to allow FDI into their economy which might produce short-term benefits but result in long-term consequences of resource depletion in the long run.</li>
<li>It is very difficult to measure changes in living standards. Increases in GDP might not be divided equally among the population. FDIs might introduce external costs of production which are likely to have a negative effect on overall living standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for FDIs to improve living standards but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negative impact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not focus entirely on an increase in access to material goods and services.</li>

<p><strong>Evaluate this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and<br>Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.</p>
<p>AO1 and AO2 out of 14 marks.<br>AO3 out of 6 marks.</p>
<p><strong>Indicative content</strong></p>

<p><strong>AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A devaluation relates to a decision by a government to fix the exchange rate of its domestic currency at a new lower level.</li>
<li>A persistent balance of payments deficit on a country's current account in goods and services will create problems because it has to be financed. If it is not financed by positive currency flows on the financial account due to direct investment or portfolio investment, it will have to be financed by reducing its reserves of foreign currency. This particular problem will only apply to a country that has adopted a fixed exchange rate.</li>
<li>In this situation the difference between the short run and the long run will be determined by the time taken to reduce the deficit and will also be measured by the final impact on the general price level that is the rate of inflation.</li>
<li>A devaluation of the domestic currency will immediately make all exported goods cheaper and all imported goods more expensive. On this basis it is assumed more exports will be sold and fewer goods will be imported. This would then help to reduce a balance of payments deficit.</li>
<li>To some extent, the ability of domestic suppliers to reduce a country’s current account balance deficit in the short run will depend on how domestic suppliers respond to the opportunity to sell more exports at a lower price. We can measure this response by calculating the price elasticity of supply of domestic producers.</li>
<li>A devaluation might not solve a balance of payments deficit on a country’s current account in goods and services in the short run because domestic supply of goods might be inelastic. This means domestic producers cannot increase output sufficiently to meet the additional demand for exports.</li>
<li>Further analysis of a devaluation on the general price level could be provided. For example, analysis might consider the proportion of imports accounted for by raw materials and how this might affect the cost of goods and services provided in an economy and how an increase in costs might lead to cost push inflation. Links to other costs such as subsequent wage demands might also be examined.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In the long run it is necessary to consider both the price elasticity of demand for imports and the price elasticity of demand for exports. The Marshall-Lerner condition states that the sum of the two elasticities must be greater than one to achieve a successful outcome.&nbsp;</li>
<li>While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.</li>
<li>It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.</li>
<li>Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>A perfect labour market would assume homogenous labour, perfect mobility, identical jobs, many buyers and sellers of labour and perfect information. This would mean that each firm’s supply of labour would be perfectly elastic and a wage taker.</li>
<li>In perfect labour markets the wage that has to be taken by each firm will be determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the industry.</li>
<li>Imperfect labour markets might occur due to the intervention of trade unions or government. A monopsony, single buyer of labour would also lead to market failure.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market failure associated with imperfect markets will often result in lower wages and/or higher levels of unemployment.</li>
<li>Intervention by trade unions by controlling the supply of labour might lead to higher wages but this is likely to cause higher levels of unemployment. A diagram that illustrates supply of and demand for labour showing a decrease in supply will illustrate this potential outcome.</li>
<li>A government might impose a minimum wage above the market equilibrium wage which would also result in higher wages but would be accompanied by higher levels of unemployment. This analysis would be supported by an accurate, clearly labelled diagram plus an explanation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A monopsony firm would employ labour where the marginal cost of labour was equal to the marginal revenue product of labour. This would potentially lead to both lower wages and higher levels of unemployment. An accurately labelled diagram plus an explanation would support this conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some circumstance it is possible for trade unions to increase labour productivity through increased training. This would increase the demand for labour by increasing the marginal productivity of labour which would enable both higher wages and higher levels of employment to be attained. This can be illustrated by a supporting diagram and further explanation.</li>
<li>The negative impact of imposing a minimum wage on the level of employment will depend upon the relative elasticities of the demand for and supply of labour. If the demand and supply are relatively inelastic then it would be possible to introduce a relatively high minimum wage which will not have a significant impact on the level of employment.</li>
<li>It is possible for trade unions to intervene in monopsonistic markets and undertake bilateral wage negotiations. Depending on the respective bargaining strengths of the union and monopsony, it might be possible for collective bargaining to raise both wages and employment. A supporting diagram plus an explanation would illustrate this potential outcome.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some circumstances a government might need to intervene to maintain the provision of vital public services as a priority, if trade unions attempt to increase wages through the withdrawal of labour.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In conclusion it is possible to show that imperfect labour markets do not always lead to lower wages and a higher level of unemployment. Trade unions, through the power of collective bargaining, can counteract the negative effects of monopsony labour markets. Also trade unions can train labour to increase labour productivity to enable an increase in wages at the same time that employment levels are rising.</li>

<li>Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.</li>
<li>Positive externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a benefit to society which is greater than that received by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimes described as a positive ‘spill-over’ effect.</li>
<li>Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-production/consumption of a good or service.</li>
<li>Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies; the use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services.</li>
<li>A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.</li>
<li>The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a positive externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the positive externality is taken into account.</li>
<li>Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised.</li>
<li>One type of intervention might involve the use of subsidies provided by a government. A subsidy will lower the cost of production which will increase supply. An increase in supply will lower price, increase the equilibrium output and achieve allocative efficiency.</li>
<li>A government might use advertising to increase demand. An increase in demand will lead to a higher consumption, output will rise and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.</li>
<li>Alternatively, a government might directly provide the good or service which can increase production and supply and eventually attain an allocatively efficient outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AO3 Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.</li>
<li>Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.</li>
<li>Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached.</li>
<li>Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces.</li>
<li>It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.</li>

<p>Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:</p>
<ul>
<li>customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer</li>
<li>emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy</li>
<li>monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.</p>
<p>But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.</p>
<p>It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.</p>
<p>The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. Since then, its real GDP has increased rapidly. A series of economic and political reforms has been responsible for its so-called 'economic miracle'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vietnam has benefitted from the increased protectionism in trade between China and the United States (US). For example, Vietnam has increased production of goods that are substitutes to those made in China to such an extent that Vietnam is popularly referred to as 'China plus one', in recognition of its similar comparative advantage to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rising export revenue is only one reason for Vietnam's spectacular economic growth. With a rapidly growing population, Vietnam has invested heavily in its human capital and physical capital in the form of infrastructure, including cheap access to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third reason for this success is how Vietnam has moved towards trade liberalisation. This is shown through its free trade agreement with the US and its membership of organisations of countries that have agreed to trade freely with each other, such as ASEAN and the TPP. These initiatives involve the removal of tariffs and other tools of protection, increasing the potential for Vietnam to trade with other countries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are possible dangers in this strategy. Vietnam's economy is heavily dependent on its exports which in 2017 were over 90% of GDP. This reliance puts Vietnam at risk from downturns in the global economy and in the economies of its main trading partners. Even more worrying is the repeated threat from the US that it may put import tariffs on manufactured goods from Vietnam.</p>

<p><strong>A government's decision to move from a fixed exchange rate system to allow free market floating exchange rates will solve the problem of unemployment in the short run but will cause higher rates of inflation in the long run. </strong><br><strong>Evaluate this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Governments in conjunction with central banks can fix exchange rates by buying and selling the domestic currency. Floating exchange rates are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. If unemployment is rising, there are different policy options available to governments. For example, lowering interest rates might stimulate aggregate demand which will increase output and employment. Lower interest rates however will put a downward pressure on a fixed exchange rate. In response, the central bank will either have to sell pounds or increase interest rates.</p>
<p>Both options will undermine policies to increase employment. If a government allows exchange rates to float freely based on market forces, a reduction in interest rates will lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency. In this case lower rates will stimulate domestic demand such as consumption/investment expenditure plus a lower value of the domestic currency will further increase demand for exports. Therefore, low interest rate policies are more likely to be successful under a floating rate system. However, it should be noted that this policy is likely to be more successful when addressing the problem of cyclical unemployment rather than other types such as structural or frictional unemployment.</p>
<p>Also, a freely floating currency which is allowed to depreciate will have some potential inflationary effects in the long run. For example, a depreciating currency will lead to a higher cost of imports and possible cost push inflation. In addition, a switch from fixed to floating exchange rates will mean that the central bank exchange rate policy will no longer have complete control over the money supply. This might be inflationary in the long run. The extent to which inflation might rise in the long run will also be determined by other factors, for example global expansion, rising commodity prices etc.</p>

<p><strong>Developing economies have a high proportion of economically inactive people relative to the size of the labour force ( a high dependency ratio). This is the main reason why the standard of living is low in developing economies. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Evaluate this statement.</strong></p>
<p>A dependency ratio indicates the extent to which the working population has to produce not only enough goods and services to sustain itself but also for the rest of the population who do not work and depend upon those who do. Dependency ratios might be high for different reasons. Some economies have a disproportionately large number of young people under the age of 15 who are economically dependent. Some economies have high dependency ratios due to a disproportionately large number of people who are too old to work. Developing economies have high dependency ratios primarily due to very high birth rates. This will have a negative impact on living standards due to the insufficient wealth creation to enable everyone in the population to have access to food, shelter, education, health care etc. A smaller working population will also pay insufficient tax to allow governments to invest in necessary public and merit goods.</p>
<p>However, there are many additional factors which also contribute to low living standards in developing economies, for example, reliance on primary products, low levels of capital investment, insufficient access to training and education, limited natural resources. Also it should be recognised that it is extremely difficult to measure living standards. GDP per capita is commonly used but this omits many important factors which might impact on living standards. Based on the above, it is difficult to accept with any degree of certainty that high dependency ratios are the main reason why the standard of living is low in developing economies.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks):</strong> For a response which explains what is meant by dependency ratio and why this ratio might be high in developing countries. Discussion will focus upon the link between a high dependency ratio and low living standards. Problems associated with defining standard of living should then be linked back to the specific question. A conclusion which addresses the specific question should then be provided.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (14–17 marks):</strong> For explanation of dependency ratio and its importance in relation to a developing country. Analysis of the links between a high dependency ration and living standards in an developing economy will be limited. There will be no attempt to question how we define living standards in the context of the specific question.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (10–13 marks):</strong> For a competent comment with the emphasis on describing what is meant by a dependency ratio.

<p><strong>Consider with the help of a circular flow diagram, why an export led growth policy is likely to be successful when a developed economy is in a recession.</strong></p>
<p>Export led growth is dependent on an outward growth strategy which relies heavily on openness and increased international trade. Successful growth should lead to an increase in national income, output, and employment. Concentration on the expansion of exports should be a key factor determining an increase in aggregate demand, output, and employment. This can be clearly illustrated, using a circular flow diagram which shows all withdrawals, all injections, and the change in national income equilibrium achievable via export led economic growth. This diagram should be clearly labelled and accurate showing an increase in injections (exports) producing a bigger increase in output/income/employment via the multiplier. An economy is in a recession when its GDP falls for two successive quarterly time periods. Recession will generally be accompanied by rising levels of unemployment due to a fall in aggregate monetary demand.</p>
<p>Government can use different economic policies to stimulate aggregate demand to move an economy out of a recession. Lower interest rates might be used to encourage investment, but this might have a limited effect due to low confidence. Government expenditure might be increased but this will depend upon the state of the public finances. When national debt is high this policy option might not be adopted. However, a policy which stimulates the growth of exports might avoid these problems and simultaneously protect the value of the domestic currency while maintaining a positive balance of payments. The effectiveness of this approach will depend upon the existing exchange rate regime used and the type of policy used, for example, lowering interest rates to depreciate a floating currency which should lead to a higher level of export growth.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a sound analysis of export led growth using an accurately labelled circular flow diagram. An explanation of the meaning of a recession should be provided. Export led policies should be compared to alternative policies that might be used to lead an economy out of a recession.</p>

<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For a response which is descriptive rather than analytical. Answers might focus on the link between the circular flow of income and an export led growth policy.

<p><strong>The introduction of new technology will increase efficiency but will also cause an increase in unemployment.</strong><br><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement?</strong></p>
<p>An increase in productivity will produce a more efficient outcome in an economy. An increase in productivity will be attained when there is an increase in output per unit of resource used in a given time period. This is usually measured by an increase in output per unit of labour employed in a given time period. The introduction of new technology in form of more advanced, more efficient machinery, should enable labour to increase productivity. However, this increase in productivity is often achieved by substituting capital for labour. As a result the level of unemployment will rise.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this is usually linked to a specific type of unemployment known as structural unemployment. There are a number of causes of unemployment for example, cyclical unemployment which are not linked to the introduction of new technology. Therefore, to some extent the statement might be correct in that structural unemployment might rise due to the substitution of capital for labour.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to distinguish between the short run immediate impact of the introduction of new technology. In the long run, it is possible that an increase in productivity will lead to falling prices, more consumer demand and ultimately more demand for labour. Also it is possible that the introduction of new technology will further reduce the cost of producing capital which will also lead to further increases in productivity. Further increases in productivity might then lead to a fall in the price of exported goods and a further increase in aggregate demand. In this case employment might rise in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For an explanation of productivity and discussion of the link between an increase in productivity and an increase in structural unemployment. Analysis of the potential short run impact should be provided. Evaluative comment might discuss possible positive long run effects on the level of employment and the importance of the type of unemployment under consideration.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For accurate but only partially developed analysis which explains what is meant by productivity and recognises that it will cause structural unemployment. The focus will be on the short run outcome. No discussion regarding long run outcomes and no conclusion will be provided</p>

<p><strong>Discuss the effectiveness of government policies which increase the net advantage of labour on the long term supply of labour in an economy.</strong></p>
<p>Government policies which increase the net advantage of labour will increase the supply of labour in the long run and this can be shown by a shift downwards to the right of the supply curve of labour. This means more workers will be supplied at every wage rate. The net advantage of labour can be divided into pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements. The former might include: wages, salary and bonus payments. Non-pecuniary advantages might include: hours of work, job security, promotion prospects and nature of the work. Reductions in income tax, increasing the minimum wage and the provision of skill training could be used to increase the pecuniary element of the net advantage.</p>
<p>However tax reductions might lead to a fall in supply because some workers will substitute work for leisure. The provision of skill training is expensive therefore has a high opportunity cost. Minimum wage might increase the supply of labour but firm’s might lower their demand for labour and therefore create excess supply. Alternatively, a government can introduce new regulations to ensure worker’s rights such as flexible working hours, working conditions, safety at work etc. Although this extra support will benefit workers new regulations are often costly to implement. In some cases it is the firm which is expected to finance improvement in working conditions and this might lead to a fall in profitability and ultimately a fall in demand for labour</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the meaning of net advantage of labour and links this to a labour supply curve. At least one policy to increase the pecuniary element of labour supply and one policy to increase the non-pecuniary element should be analysed. In both cases some evaluative comment should enable comment on the effectiveness of the policy.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a competent comment with limited analysis that recognises that net advantage is composed of pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements but does not establish a clear link with the labour supply curve. One policy in relation to both elements will be identified but not analysed in depth. No evaluative comment will be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For an attempt that describes net advantage of labour but only examines one policy in relation to one element of the net advantage. Analysis of this policy will not be fully developed.</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–4 marks): </strong>For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market.</strong></p>
<p>Answers should clearly identify and explain the key assumptions which explain the difference between these two labour markets. A monopsony market will consist of a single employer of labour; as a result the supply of labour to the firm will be upward sloping to the right. A profit maximising monopsonist employer will employ labour up to the point where the marginal cost of employing labour is equal to the marginal productivity of labour. A firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market will pay a wage determined by the market as a whole. The firm will be a wage taker and the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at the given wage.</p>
<p>Supporting diagrams in each case should clarify this difference. An increase in labour productivity would be reflected by an increase in the marginal physical product and therefore an increase in the marginal product of labour. In both market situations this would lead to a shift to the right of the firms MRP curve which is equivalent to an increase in the demand for labour. The impact in the case of monopsony will depend upon the extent of the increase in productivity. In a monopsony market, a significant increase in productivity will lead to a relatively higher increase in wages and employment but the extent of these changes will also be determined to some extent by the marginal cost of employing additional labour. In a perfectly competitive market, an increase in productivity will increase the demand for labour but the wage rate will remain the same.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For an explanation of the difference between monopsony and a perfectly competitive labour market and a detailed analysis of the relationship between an increase in productivity, change in MRP and change in demand for labour. This analysis will then be applied to both markets and the respective impact of these changes on wages and employment in both markets will be compared.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For competent analysis which clearly distinguishes between the two types of market and understands the relationship between changes in productivity, MRP and the demand for labour. An attempt should be made to compare the impact on wages and employment in both markets but the analysis will not be fully developed.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks): </strong>For a brief and less clearly established link between labour productivity, MRP and the demand for labour. Some knowledge of the differences between the two types of labour market but only a very limited attempt to analyse the impact on one of the markets.</p>

<p><strong>High market concentration ratios are closely linked to Oligopoly market structures.</strong><br><strong>Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Some industries are dominated by a few large firms. A concentration ratio indicates the extent to which large firms might dominate an industry. For example, 4 large firms might control more than 80% of a market while a large number of small firms account for the remaining 20% of the market. In this case the four firm concentration ratio would be 80%.</p>
<p>Oligopolies are market structures which can be specifically identified by noting that there are only a few large firms which dominate the market i.e. they have high market concentration ratios and they also have high barriers to entry which maintains their dominant position. However, because of the nature of this type of market structure, firms have to take into account the reaction of their main rivals before adopting their pricing strategy i.e. they are interdependent. If a firm chooses to ignore the reactions of its main rivals, this could result in a price war where each firm loses potential revenue and consumers gain. As a result Oligopolies will often adopt alternative strategies to maintain/increase market share and maximise profits. Sometimes firms will collude and agree to fix a price. This is illegal but it is still used.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the dominant firm within the group might become the price leader and set the market price which other large firms choose to follow. Game theory and the theory of the kinked demand curve can be used to assess which strategy might be the most effective. Most of these alternative pricing strategies will lead to price rigidity. It should be noted that many Oligopoly firms will adopt non price competition such as advertising or increasing product differentiation to avoid the negative impact of price competition.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks): </strong>For a clear explanation of what is meant by a high market concentration ratio and an attempt to link this to an Oligopoly market structure. Analysis of alternative pricing policies which might subsequently be adopted will be provided and an assessment of their likely impact on a firm's profits/market share. Some reference to alternative non pricing market strategies might form part of a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For an accurate reference to the question and clear understanding of the term high market concentration ratio and its link to an Oligopoly market structure. One link to a pricing policy should be analysed in detail, other strategies might be referred to but not fully developed.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For a briefer descriptive comment that explains the terms in the question and provides some evidence of the main characteristics of an Oligopoly. Reference to pricing policies might be made but not clearly linked to the nature of the market structure.</p>

<p><strong>Limit pricing may sometimes be used by a monopoly. It creates a barrier to entry which benefits consumers in the short run but increases costs to the consumer in the long run.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Monopoly firms will control the entire market or in some legal definitions, control at least 25% of the market. Barriers to entry will be used to prevent new firms entering the market and any subsequent loss of market share. It is also assumed that Monopoly firms will attempt to maximise profits and this will be achieved by letting the level of output be determined by the point where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). In some circumstances, when the market price falls to a relatively low level, it becomes possible for a new firm to enter the market and profit by charging a price which covers its costs. To prevent this, Monopoly firms might choose to lower their profit maximising but still cover costs and still maintain a satisfactory level of profits.</p>
<p>Monopolies can benefit from dynamic efficiency which is likely to lower average total costs compared to a new smaller firm attempting to enter the market. The new price is known as a Limit price and this can be shown with the help of a diagram which identifies a monopoly’s cost curve and a chosen limit price which is lower than the costs of the new firm. This is why limit pricing can act as a barrier to entry. On this basis it is likely that consumers will benefit in the short run due to a Monopoly firm’s decision to lower prices. However, in the long run, if the threat of entry has been removed and with it the threat to maintaining its market share, it is possible that a monopoly will then revert to its profit maximising policy. This will lead to higher prices which will have a negative impact on consumers and higher prices might now be maintained for a longer time period because the threat of competition has been removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the monopoly might invest the additional profits in research and development and achieve dynamic efficiency which will enable costs to be further reduced and low prices maintained.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For an explanation of monopoly and why limit pricing might be used as a barrier to entry. The links between dynamic efficiency, low costs and the use of limit pricing as a barrier to entry should by analysed. The benefits to the consumer in the short run and potential costs in the long run should be evaluated and a conclusion provided.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks): </strong>For a competent analysis of the relationship between a monopoly, dynamic efficiency, limit pricing and barriers to entry. Some limited comment will be made in relation to the potential difference to costs/benefits to the consumer in the short run and the long run.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For a brief, descriptive approach which refers to monopoly and the use of limit pricing. Detailed analysis will not be provided to illustrate why limit pricing can act as a barrier to entry. No attempt to consider the difference between short and long run implications of pricing policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.</p>
<p>Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.</p>
<p>In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a clear, explanation of what economists mean by a public good and its relationship to market failure. The key elements of cost benefit analysis should then be set out. The link between the nature of public goods and the use of cost benefit analysis should be established and a discussion of the effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in this situation should be provided.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For an explanation of what is meant by public goods. Cost benefit analysis will be explained but not fully developed. There will be a limited attempt to link the provision of public goods to cost benefit analysis. The effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in these circumstances will not be considered.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5-6 marks):</strong> For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of public goods and some of the key aspects of cost benefit analysis. There will only be a very limited attempt to link a government’s decision to provide a public good and the use of cost benefit analysis. No evaluation of the effectiveness of cost benefit will be provided.</p>

<p><strong>Pareto optimality can only be achieved when an economy is both productively and allocatively efficient. This will create a more equitable society. </strong><br><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Answers should provide a clear explanation that productive efficiency is achieved when a firm achieves minimum average total cost for a given level of output or alternatively when an economy is operating on its production possibility boundary. Allocative efficiency will be achieved when resources are allocated to ensure that the price of a unit charged to the consumer is equal to the marginal cost of producing that unit. In this case the firm will produce at an output where price (AR) = marginal cost (MC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a macroeconomic level, allocative efficiency will be attained when all resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction in society. This will be attained when an economy is operating at one specific point on its production possibility curve. Pareto optimality will be achieved when it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off. Any point below the production possibility curve would not be optimal because it would not fulfil this condition. Similarly an economy which is not operating at the unique allocatively efficient point on the production possibility curve would also not fulfil this condition, therefore the first part of the statement in the question is correct.</p>
<p>However, equity relates to an outcome where the distribution of income and/or wealth is considered to be fair. Governments can intervene, for example, through the use of re-distributive fiscal policies to produce a more equitable outcome but Pareto optimality which produces efficient outcomes will not automatically lead to a more equitable outcome. Thus the statement in the question is only partially correct.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains productive and allocative efficiency. Each type of efficiency should by analysed from a macroeconomic perspective. The concept of Pareto optimality should be explained and clearly linked to both types of efficiency. The second part of the statement should be discussed by explaining what is meant by equity and discussing whether there is a link between Pareto optimality and equity. A conclusion should be provided.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a competent comment which clearly defines productive and allocative efficiency. Pareto optimality might be explained and partially linked to different types of efficiency. Equity would be briefly described but not clearly discussed in relation to Pareto optimality and no conclusion will be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks): </strong>For a descriptive explanation of both types of efficiency and a definition of Pareto optimality. The link between efficiency and Pareto optimality will not be clearly established and there will be no attempt to distinguish between efficiency and equity and no attempt made to address the specific question.</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–4 marks):</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.</p>

<p>Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nations producing palm oil view it as a means of reducing poverty, while international finance organisations regard it as an engine of growth for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) encouraged Malaysia and Indonesia to cultivate natural resources and to produce more palm oil in spite of an awareness of high external costs. Dutch banks provided more than US$12 billion in loans to Indonesian producers. Palm oil is Indonesia’s main export earner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Widespread adoption of palm oil began when, in 1995, one of the world's major multinational companies decided to use it in its global food manufacturing industries instead of animal fats and other vegetable oils, which were then said to be unhealthy. It invested heavily in expanding palm oil plantations in Malaysia and achieved considerable cost savings because palm oil has a much higher yield per hectare than other vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Palm oil's versatility is not limited to food. It is used in 70% of personal care products (toiletries) such as soap, shampoo and make-up. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel fuel.</p>
<p>As the palm oil industry expanded, conservationists began to raise the alarm about the devastating effects from carbon emissions and on wildlife habitats. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of some rare animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, one supermarket promised to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. Norway banned imports for biodiesel production. The European Parliament proposed that public subsidies for biodiesel should be removed by 2021. If this proposal is enacted it will affect the demand for biodiesel and may force palm oil producing countries to reduce deforestation programmes, leading to improved environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 illustrates the palm oil uses in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>A government's decision to increase its budget deficit as a proportion of the economy's GDP will depend significantly upon whether the economy's output gap is positive or negative.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>With the help of a diagram explain and evaluate this statement.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Answers should explain that a budget deficit will occur when government total expenditure is greater than its total income. It should also be recognised that a decision to increase a budget deficit as a proportion of a country's GDP, is likely to inject additional expenditure into an economy. On this basis this policy would be expansionary, in that it has been introduced to increase expenditure, income, output and employment.</p>
<p>An output gap will be positive can be explained in different ways. One approach states that a positive output gap will occur when actual output is above the level of the trend output. Alternative approaches might use production possibility curves or aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis. Each of these approaches can be explained using a diagram. Each approach should recognise that a positive output gap is associated with an economy that is overheating or undergoing inflationary pressure. A negative output gap can be explained using the same three approaches outlined above. In each of these cases an economy will not be using all its resources and is likely to be in recession. Based on the above it is clear that a government is highly unlikely to increase its budget deficit if the economy is experiencing a positive output gap. Diagrams could be used to show that such a policy in such circumstances is highly likely to lead to high levels of inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, an increase in a budget deficit is likely to stimulate the output and employment when the output gap is negative. A diagram could be used to show the potential impact of such a policy. Evaluative comment might note that the extent of positive effect of an increase budget deficit will depend upon the cause of the output gap. It will be less effective if the gap is caused by structural unemployment rather than cyclical unemployment. Also, the use of large budget deficits to close a negative income gap might create additional problems such as high interest rates (crowding out), high inflation in the long run, or negative effects on the balance of payments.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks)</strong> For an answer which explains what is meant by a budget deficit and how an increase in this deficit might impact on key macroeconomic variables. A clear explanation of positive and negative output gaps with supporting diagrams should be provided. The impact of a deficit with respect to each gap should be analysed. The potential beneficial effects of an increase in the deficit on a negative output gap should then be evaluated.&nbsp;<br><strong>L3 (14–17 marks)</strong> For clear analysis which uses a diagram to explain each type of output gap. The focus will show how an increase in a budget deficit as a proportion of GDP might affect a negative output gap. There will be no attempt to evaluate the extent to which the negative output gap might be closed. <br><strong>L2 (10–13 marks)</strong> For a less well-developed comment which describes the meaning of a budget deficit and both types of output gap. Diagrams provided might not be clearly labelled and the link between a negative output gap and a budget deficit will not be analysed in detail. <br><strong>L1 (1–9 marks)</strong> For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what economists mean by an increase in real GDP per capita and discuss the extent to which an increase in real GDP per capita will have a positive impact on economic development.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>GDP is measured by the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy in a particular time period, usually one year. To ensure that an accurate measure of the real output is attained with we have to take account of the price element of the change in value of goods. By taking inflation into account we can calculate the real value of GDP. It is also helpful to calculate the relationship between this increase in real value of GDP and any change in population. Economists will divide the real GDP by the total population to calculate the amount of GDP that is available per person. This would now allow economists to calculate real GDP per capita. An increase in real GDP per capita is consistent with the achievement of economic growth. This potentially allows the population access to more goods and services and this is often associated with an increase in living standards.</p>
<p>However, economic development considers a much wider range of variables than economic growth and many of these variables are more difficult to measure accurately. Economic development attempts to measure the improvement in the overall quality of life enjoyed by the population. Key measures of development include access to education; access to health care; life expectancy; lower levels of poverty. An increase in real GDP per capita might have a positive impact on economic development because more resources will be available to provide better education, better access to health care and a subsequent increase in life expectancy. However, an increase in GDP per capita might a have a negative impact on economic development for reasons which might include negative effects on the environment; loss of leisure time; further inequalities in the distribution of wealth; unsustainable growth due to overuse of scare resources.</p>

Economic development will be clearly defined and at least two positive links between an increase in real GDP per capita and economic development established and analysed. At least two potential negative impacts on development will be identified and discussed and a conclusion will be provided. <br><strong>L3 (14–17 marks)</strong> For a limited explanation of real GDP per capita and analysis of at least one positive link between an increase in real GDP per capita and development plus a recognition of one potential negative impact on development.

<p><strong>Explain, with the help of a diagram, explain the Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap and consider the importance of the liquidity trap to government policy makers when an economy is in a recession.</strong></p>
<p>The Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap relies heavily upon the Keynesian theory of interest rate determination. This theory assumes that the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money. It is also assumed that the demand for money becomes perfectly elastic when the rate of interest on securities becomes very low and that the supply of money is perfectly inelastic because it is determined solely by the Central Bank. This can be illustrated by a supply and demand diagram. When an economy is in a recession, GDP will be falling, incomes will be low and unemployment will be relatively high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monetary policy such as lowering interest rates might be used to stimulate aggregate demand and move the economy out of a recession. However, according to Keynesian theory, when interest rates reach a very low level, an increase in the money supply to stimulate the economy will have no effect because this policy will have no further effect on interest rates. This form of monetary will no longer work. A diagram can support this conclusion by clearly identifying the liquidity trap. If policy makers recognise the existence of a liquidity trap, they might then choose to rely on alternative policies to move an economy out of a recession. Alternative measures might include: a devaluation of the domestic currency if is based on a fixed exchange rate; the use of expansionary fiscal policies such as increased government spending and/or tax reduction; or various supply side measures to increase productivity</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> For a sound analysis of the Keynesian theory of interest rate determination, supported by accurate, clearly labelled diagrams. A recession should be explained and the link between a recession and policies used to move out of a recession should be considered. A least one alternative policy approach should be explained and discussed and a conclusion provided. <br><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> For an analysis of the Keynesian theory of interest determination and an identification of the liquidity trap. Links between policies to move out of a recession and the liquidity trap will be established. No alternative policies which might be used because of the liquidity trap will be discussed and no conclusion will be provided. <br><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> For a response which is descriptive rather than analytical. Answers will explain Keynesian theory of interest rate determination but will not use this to analyse the link between the liquidity trap and the effectiveness of the use of monetary policy to move an economy out of a recession. <br><strong>L1 (1–4 marks)</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.</p>

<p><strong>The most important aim of a central bank is to control the money supply while the most important aim of a commercial (retail) bank is to maximise profits.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the extent to which these two aims can be achieved together.</strong></p>
<p>Central banks have a number of important roles. One of the most important roles is the use of monetary policy to try and ensure financial stability and help a government to meet its target rate of inflation. Monetary policy would include the use of interest rate changes, exchange rate changes and controlling the money supply. The need to control the money supply is strongly linked to the relationship between the amount of money in an economy can have an important impact on the rate of inflation. Different policy instruments are available to a central bank to enable control of the money supply, these might include changes in interest rates and/or the use of open market operations.</p>
<p>Commercial banks are responsible for creating the largest proportion of the money supply, because banks grant loans which produce new bank deposits which automatically add to the money supply. Therefore, if a central bank increases interest rates, less borrowing from the commercial banks will take place, when bank lending falls bank deposits will fall. When this takes place, the central bank will have achieved its aim of decreasing the money supply. However, commercial bank lending is one of the main sources of commercial bank profits. On this basis one could argue that central bank policy is likely to lead to a fall in commercial bank profits. If this is true then it would seem that the two aims referred to in the statement in question are not compatible. But it could also be argued that the demand for bank loans might be interest inelastic. In this case higher interest rates are likely to lead to an increase in commercial bank profits and therefore the two aims might be compatible.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks)</strong> For a response which explains why central banks would want to control the money supply and how commercial banks might maximise profits. Analysis of the impact of changes in the rate of interest on the money supply and also on commercial banks’ profits should be provided. A discussion of the extent to which the two aims are compatible should then follow, supported by a conclusion. <br><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> For an explanation of both aims and the mechanisms through which each aim might be achieve. Accurate developed analysis based on both aims stated in the question will be provided but there will be a very limited attempt to establish the extent to which both aims might be compatible. A conclusion will not be provided. <br><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> For a mainly descriptive comment which demonstrates understanding of why control of the money supply is an important aim of a central bank and also explains what the main influence on commercial bank profitability is. Analysis of how these two aims might be achieved will not be provided. <br><strong>L1 (1–4 marks)</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what is meant by the marginal revenue product theory and consider the relationship between this theory and a trades union's ability to gain higher wages for its members.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Marginal revenue product theory is a theory which explains what determines the demand for labour. The value of an individual worker’s marginal revenue product is made up of two parts. The marginal physical product of a worker multiplied by the marginal revenue gained by the firm when the product is sold will determine the worker’s marginal revenue product. It is assumed that each firm in all labour markets are profit maximisers and will therefore employ workers up to the point where the worker’s marginal product is equal to the marginal cost of employing this extra unit of labour. In this case, either an increase in worker productivity (increase in worker MPP) or an increase in the marginal revenue gained (MR) will increase MRP. This will shift the demand curve (MRP curve) to the right and indicate an increase in the demand for labour.</p>
<p>The extent to which this increase in demand will enable Trades Unions to negotiate higher wages will be determined to some extent by the nature of the labour market in which they operate. In a perfectly competitive labour market analysis will focus on a situation where wage rates are determined by the supply of and the demand for labour. In this case trade unions can raise the demand for labour by increasing training and ultimately MRP.</p>
<p>However wages will only rise if the MRP of all labour in all firms increase. If the increase is confined to one firm, wages will not rise. In a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the marginal revenue product theory and analyses the potential impact of a Trades Union’s ability to change MRP in both a perfectly competitive labour market and an imperfect labour market. A conclusion should summarize the differences between the two markets. <br><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> For a competent comment with analysis that recognises the determinants of MRP, and how this relates to the demand for labour. Further analysis will establish the links between MRP, Trades Unions and higher wage rates. However the analysis will only be confined to one type of labour market. <br><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> For an attempt describes what is meant by the marginal revenue product and links this to the demand for labour. A limited attempt will be made to show how Trades Unions can bargain for higher wages but the analysis will not be fully developed. <br><strong>L1 (1–4 marks)</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Distinguish between economic rent and transfer earnings and with the help of diagrams discuss why famous sports people receive much higher pay than street cleaners.</strong></p>
<p>Transfer earning is the minimum payment to a worker to remain in their job. Economic rent is that payment beyond that necessary to keep a factor of production in its current use. A diagram can be used to identify this difference in the labour market. Links between the elasticity of supply of labour and transfer earnings and economic rent can be further established with the help of diagrams. Famous sports people have special talents which mean that the supply of such players is limited and very inelastic. Provided there is a strong demand to watch tennis, then it is likely that famous sports people will receive very high pay. Moreover, because their particular skill is not transferable, most of a sports person's high pay will in the form of economic rent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The supply of street cleaners is likely to be highly elastic because of the low skill levels required and the short training period necessary. Therefore, even if demand for street cleaners rose significantly, it is still unlikely that they would be able to gain a high pay rise. Also the combination of a high and elastic supply should lead to most of their pay consisting of transfer payments. It is possible for pay levels to fall for famous sports people if they fail to provide sufficient entertainment and the demand to watch an individual player falls or if there is a general decline in the demand to watch professional sports. It is also possible for pay levels of street cleaners to rise if they form part of a Trades Union or benefit from changes in government policy regarding the pay of workers in the public sector.</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. </strong><br><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.</p>
<p>Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> For a clear, explanation of monopoly profit maximisation pricing and an analysis of why limit pricing could be used and the extent to which its use would support the statement in question. Evaluative comment should also be provided to question how far the statement in question can be supported. <br><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> For a clear analysis of how a profit maximising monopolist would choose its output and how limit pricing works and the extent to which its use supports the statement in question. No evaluative comment will be provided to question the extent to which the statement in question is correct. <br><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of the profit maximising pricing strategy of a monopoly and also how limit pricing might work. However, the distinction between the short run and long run impact of limit pricing will not discussed and no analysis further analysis of the statement in question will be provided. <br><strong>L1 (1–4 marks)</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure.</strong></p>
<p>Collusion takes place when firms find that it is in their interest to co-operate with their rivals to maximise profits. Usually this will mean that firms agree together to fix output or prices or both output and price. This is known as forming a cartel. It is also known as formal collusion and is usually illegal. Sometimes an informal agreement takes place (tacit collusion). In this a dominant firm will set the price/output and other firms will then do the same. It is possible to identify specific factors which would favour collusion. These might include firms are likely to produce similar products using similar production methods; firms will be large, often with a dominant firm; there are significant barriers to entry; the market they operate in is usually stable; governments do not interfere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all market structures are likely to fulfil these conditions. Firms operating in perfectly competitive markets are price takers and there are no barriers to entry. Firms operating in monopolistic competition are very small, they sell differentiated products and there are no barriers to entry. Monopoly firms, are large but by definition, do not face competition because they control all the market, so collusion would not be relevant. Oligopoly markets consist of a few large firms, which often produce similar types of goods and use barriers to entry. These factors would produce the ideal conditions to promote collusive behaviour. Therefore it is reasonable to agree with the view that collusion will only take place in an Oligopoly market.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although collusion can take place it does not automatically ensure that it will. Also, Oligopoly firms will still compete with each other through alternative means such as advertising and/or product differentiation. It should also be recognised that many cartel agreements break down because of cheating or one or more firms not fully sticking to the agreed rules.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks)</strong> For a clear explanation what is meant by collusion. The key characteristics of a market which are necessary to enable firms to collude successfully should be identified.

At least two types of market structures should be discussed in relation to the specific question and a brief conclusion should be provided. <strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> For a briefer descriptive explanation of collusion and a reference to at least one condition necessary for it to take place. Reference to one type of market structure should be made but no conclusion will be provided in relation to the specific question. <br><strong>L1 (1–4 marks)</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what is meant by cost benefit analysis and consider how it might be used by a government to decide whether a new hospital should be built.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to consider negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits. In many cases the provision of certain types of good will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value of benefits that might be gained from a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The type of analysis outlined above would be particularly useful when considering whether to build a new hospital. Hospitals are huge capital projects; they are extremely costly and the associated benefits are only likely to be gained over a long time period. As well as private costs there are likely to be negative externalities, for example, effect on the local wildlife, increased traffic congestion around the hospital. Also there will be positive externalities, for example easier access to health care for local residents, more jobs for doctors and nurses, local multiplier effects associated with building and maintaining the hospital. When all the costs and benefits have been considered, a government has to decide whether the net benefit justifies the decision by comparing this with the opportunity cost. It should be recognised that it is very difficult to put a monetary value on externalities and to estimate the future benefits in real terms i.e. allowing for inflation.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks)</strong> For a reasoned and clear discussion which analyses and explains the key characteristics of cost benefit analysis. This analysis should then be applied to explain government decision making, in this case whether to build a new hospital. Evaluative comment should refer to at least two problems associated with using this type of decision making. <br><strong>L3 (14–17 marks)</strong> For a competent analysis which clearly explains how cost benefit can be used to aid a government when deciding whether to build a new hospital. At least one evaluative comment should be provided which illustrates a difficulty associated with the use of such analysis. <br><strong>L2 (10–13 marks)</strong> For a descriptive explanation of cost benefit analysis but there will be little attempt to link this analysis to consider the government's decision whether to build a new hospital. No specific problems associated with the use of this analysis will be identified. <br><strong>L1 (1–9 marks)</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.</p>

<p>Romania, like other former planned economies in eastern Europe has increased the amount of private enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in its economy. Romania's economy has boomed in recent years and compares favourably with economies in the European Union (EU) as indicated in Fig. 1.1.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./AL Econ MS only_files/62069ef8ab4211edb54500163e02ecea-1676253711.png" alt="" width="585" height="259"></p>
<p>This economic boom has been characterised by the expansion of services and manufacturing sectors. In particular the high-tech industries have been very successful and are expected to double their contribution to GDP to 12% by 2025. The low wage rate in Romania was a benefit for foreign companies. For example, global car companies have, since 2008, invested US$1.4 billion in Romania’s car factories that has increased employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Romania joined the EU in 2007, many Romanian workers took advantage of the free movement of labour the EU allows. In 2008, 600000 out of a population of 21.2m left Romania. In spite of its economic boom, Romania has failed to attract sufficient workers back and there is now a shortage of labour. The total population is lower than in 2008 at 19.4m. Unemployment was only 5.9% in 2017 compared with an average rate of 8.6% for the EU as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2015, the government has taken measures to boost the economy. It reduced sales tax from 24% to 19%, which increased consumer demand. It also doubled the national minimum wage providing a boost for both private sector and public sector employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there are also serious economic challenges. The gap between government income and spending has widened causing a rising budget deficit. The transport infrastructure remains poor. In a World Economic Forum report in 2016, Romania was ranked 128<sup>th</sup> out of 138 countries for the quality of its road network and 79<sup>th</sup> for its railway system.</p>

<p>A direct tax is one that is paid by individuals or businesses direct to the government. It is based on an individual’s income or on the profits of a business. Examples are income tax and profits tax. An indirect tax is so-called because it is not directly collected by the government-retailers and local government agencies are the main collectors. The tax is based on the purchase of products. Examples are GST or VAT and duties charged on sales of petrol, cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
<p>A direct tax is usually progressive, the rate of taxation increasing as income increases. Indirect taxes are regressive since they have to be paid irrespective of the income of the consumer.</p>
<p>The marginal rate of taxation is the proportion of <strong>extra</strong> income taken in tax. This will rise with a progressive tax thus increasing the burden on higher income groups. It will fall with a regressive tax thus increasing the burden on lower income groups. The average rate of tax refers to the proportion of income taken so for a progressive tax the marginal rate of taxation will be <strong>higher</strong> than the average rate of taxation and <strong>lower</strong> for a regressive tax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An increase in direct taxes is likely to lead to a fall in AD and therefore inflation due to a fall in consumption and investment. It is likely to be easy to implement and may be seen as fair if the tax is progressive as the burden will fall more on higher income groups. However, it may reduce incentives and lead to lower economic growth.</p>
<p>An increase in interest rates should lead to an increase in savings and a fall in consumption and investment due to the increase in borrowing. The effects are likely to be quicker than an increase in direct taxes due to the speed of implementation. However, it may have similar consequences to an increase in direct taxes and it may be ineffective if interest rates are already very low, or confidence levels remain high.</p>
<p>Both evaluation and analysis may make reference to the fact that effectiveness of both methods depends on the type of inflation i,e., if it is costpush rather than demand -pull, they may be ineffective..</p>

<p>The purpose of maximum price legislation is to ensure that consumers get access to supplies of essential products such as various types of food and in some cases, water and power supplies. It may also free up income to purchase other essential items. To be effective the maximum price must be below the equilibrium price in a free market, and this may be referred to in the first part of the analysis. An accurate diagram should not be expected but would enhance the quality of the analysis.</p>
<p>However, the problem with a maximum price is that demand invariably exceeds supply at this price. Shortages can occur and this can lead to an informal market and profiteering along with rationing and queuing. Consumers may end up paying even more than the equilibrium price to get the supplies they need.</p>

<p>The higher cost of production in Pakistan has serious implications for Pakistan's participation in global trade in agricultural products. This problem is particularly critical as Pakistan seeks to increase exports to reduce a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.</p>
<p>A complaint of farmers is that GST, a sales tax, is charged when they purchase fertilisers. In May, the government gave in to pressure and cut GST on fertilisers from 17% to 2%. Farmers' leaders want the tax to be completely removed from fertiliser sales. Their priority, however, is for a large increase in the subsidy paid to farmers to a level comparable to that paid to farmers in India. In Pakistan's current economic position this prospect appears to be remote.</p>
<p>Pakistan's farmers also complain about the subsidies that are paid to farmers in richer neighbouring countries. They strongly argue that these subsidies are unfair on farmers from developing countries and are holding back their economic development.</p>

<p><strong>Extract 1: World export prices of maize fall sharply</strong></p>
<p>Export prices of maize declined further in April 2020, with the United States (US) maize price nearly 10% down from April 2019. It is now at the lowest value in more than ten years. Large global supplies and good harvest prospects in South America continue to reduce prices. In addition, lower demand for maize from the biofuel and animal feed industries is depressing the price further.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 12/05/2020</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Extract 2: Zimbabwe takes steps to curb the rise in maize prices</strong></p>
<p>Despite a falling world price for maize, the price of this staple food in Zimbabwe has continued to increase and is now at an exceptionally high level. The increased price mostly results from continued weakness in Zimbabwe’s currency that has damaged the country’s ability to import maize. In addition, the sharply reduced harvest of maize in Zimbabwe resulted in low domestic supplies. In an effort to tackle the soaring prices, the government has implemented several policies. To increase market supplies, the government removed a ban on imports of certain types of maize. It also increased producer subsidies on maize by 40%. Poorer households should benefit from access to this subsidised maize.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 17/02/2020</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Extract 3: Malawi raises guaranteed minimum price for maize&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture has released updated guaranteed prices for cereals produced on Malawi's farms in 2020. These are the minimum prices that farmers will receive for their crops. The guaranteed price for the food staple, maize, was raised by just over 10%. The government has begun purchasing maize at this increased price. This change in the minimum price is expected to increase the production of maize in 2020 and in the future to an average level of 3.7 million tonnes per year.</p>

<p><strong>Discuss, with the help of a diagram, whether a subsidy on maize production will always benefit both the producers of maize and poorer households in Zimbabwe equally. </strong></p>

<p>The diagram should show a shift to the right of the supply curve and a fall in pricebenefitting consumers and the payment to producers shown as the vertical distance between the new supply curve and the old supply curve at the new price. For both marks for the diagram, the impact on the price paid by the consumer and the effective price received by the producer must be clearly shown.</p>
<p>The answer just requires a brief explanation that the extent of the benefit to producers and consumers depends mainly on PED e.g. if it is elastic then producers will gain more and if inelastic, consumers will. May also depend on PES and consumers gain more when PES is more elastic and vice versa.</p>

<p><em>Source: Adapted from 'In a fix', The Economist, 11 January 2020</em></p>
<p>Governments generally impose price controls for one of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>to redistribute income in an economy: maximum prices help the poor afford the necessities of life, whereas minimum prices support the livelihoods of farmers</li>
<li>to stabilise a market: governments use stocks to smooth fluctuations in the price of a commodity like cocoa, buying when there is excess supply in the market and selling when there is excess demand</li>
<li>to control inflation: maximum prices have been used in many countries</li>
</ul>
<p>Many economists have been critical of the use of price controls by governments. In a market without government intervention, a product's price acts as a signal of its scarcity and an incentive to overcome scarcity. However, minimum prices can lead to food rotting in warehouses while maximum prices can lead to hoarding and black markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be very unpopular. For example, in Santiago, the capital city of Chile, an increase in the minimum price on the public transport system led to widespread unrest in 2019. In the same year, the government of Iran decided to raise the minimum price of fuel sharply and suddenly, leading to a great deal of protest.</p>
<p>A representative of the World Bank has stated that one reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be hard to remove, expressing the view that 'it is better not to have them in the first place.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.</p>
<p>Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.</p>
<p>In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.</p>
<p>The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.</p>
<p>The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.</p>

<p><strong>Keynesians argue that increasing budget deficits will solve the problem of unemployment. Monetarists argue that supply side policies are more effective in reducing unemployment.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider which view is more likely to be correct.</strong></p>
<p>Candidates should explain that a budget deficit will occur when government total expenditure is greater than its total income. It should also be explained that unemployment is considered to be a problem primarily because it represents a waste of valuable scarce resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keynesians argue that an increased budget deficit will create additional expenditure/aggregate monetary demand which, in conjunction with the multiplier effect, will lead to an increase in output, income and employment. However, monetarists suggest that this approach might not be effective because: additional borrowing due to a budget deficit will lead to higher interest rates, lower investment and a countervailing fall in monetary demand; alternatively monetarists suggest it the financing of the deficit depends upon printing new money, this will ultimately lead to inflation; that it is the cause of unemployment which matters and Keynesian solutions would not be helpful regarding structural unemployment caused by changes in the pattern of demand and/or frictions in the labour market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore monetarists would argue that supply side policies, either based on direct government intervention, for example reducing corporation tax or by interfering with the price mechanism to reduce frictions in the labour market. For example introducing de-regulation and promoting privatisation. An attempt should be made to summarize the preceding argument and recognising that a key difference between the two approaches is closely linked to the type of unemployment under consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks):</strong> For an answer which explains what is meant by a budget deficit and which recognizes why unemployment constitutes a significant economic problem. Analysis of both the Keynesian and Monetarist proposed solutions will be provided. Analysis in both cases should be subject to at least one evaluative comment. A conclusion should recognize that a key difference between the two solutions advocated should relate to the specific type of unemployment under consideration.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (14–17 marks):</strong> For analysis which addresses both the Keynesian and Monetarist approach to solving the problem of unemployment. A budget deficit and the reason why unemployment will also be explained in the process. However, there will be little evidence of evaluative comment with respect to either approach. A brief conclusion might be provided but it will not recognize the key explanation regarding the difference between the two approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (10–13 marks):</strong> For a less well developed comment which describes the meaning of a budget deficit and the problem of unemployment. Also some attempt will be made to distinguish between Keynesian demand side policies and Monetarist supply side policies but this will not be supported by any in-depth analysis. No attempt will be made to directly compare the effectiveness of the two policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–9 marks):</strong> For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.</p>

<p><strong>Explain what is meant by a transmissions mechanism of monetary policy and consider why it might not work in practice.</strong></p>
<p>Monetary transmissions mechanisms attempt to explain how changes in monetary policy might have an impact on key macroeconomic goals such as national income, output, employment and inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers may explain either the Keynesian model or an alternative model based on a central bank changing the base rate of interest. Keynes suggested that an increase in the money supply might affect real variables such as output and employment because this would be transmitted by a fall in interest rates, leading to a rise in investment/aggregate monetary demand and ultimately an increase in GDP and employment. However, Keynes also identified a number of reasons why this approach might not work effectively in practice. Reasons might include: the existence of a liquidity trap; an interest inelastic investment; a relatively low multiplier effect; negative effect of a rise in income on interest rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar approach might be adopted in relation to the use of a central bank’s mechanism to change interest rates to control the rate of inflation. Again, the success of this approach will rely heavily upon the strength of the links between a change in monetary policy and each of the variables which will determine the final outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For either approach an explanation of the meaning of <strong>monetary transmissions mechanism</strong> is required and supporting analysis should be fully developed and critically evaluated. In either approach, at least two evaluative comments should be provided. A reasoned conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the chosen monetary transmissions mechanism might work in practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks): </strong>For accurate but only partially developed analysis based on either approach which provides at least one evaluative comment. Some attempt to draw upon the analysis and form a conclusion should be demonstrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discuss the role and importance of the commercial banks in a developed economy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Key roles associated with commercial banks include: to allow the safekeeping of funds; to provide loans to consumers and producers; to act as financial intermediaries and make it easier for payments to be made within and between persons and firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these roles can be linked to growth and development in a developed economy. Savings can be used to allow firms to borrow for investment purposes thus promoting long term economic growth. Loans can be also provided to consumers to promote an increase in consumer expenditure, increased aggregate demand and an increase in output and employment. Financial intermediation and easier methods of payment should promote specialisation and exchange thus further encouraging economic growth.</p>
<p>However it should also be noted that profitably is one of the main aims of a commercial bank and in some circumstances it is not clear that the needs of would- be investors are not consistent with the aims of a commercial bank. Banks have to maintain liquidity and security as well as profitability. Hence much needed loans to the private sector are not always available. In addition commercial bank loans create new bank deposits which automatically increase the money supply in an economy. In some situations this does not help a government to maintain an appropriate monetary policy. For example, a rapid increase in bank lending would be unwise when an economy is experiencing rising rates of inflation. A conclusion should summarise the preceding discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For a description of three key functions of a commercial bank. Responses should then discuss the importance of at least two of these roles in relation to a developed economy. Each role should be analysed and at least one evaluative comment provided in relation to each role discussed. A conclusion should attempt to assess the importance of commercial banks in relation to the preceding analysis/discussion.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a description of at least two functions of a commercial bank and an attempt to analyse the importance of these functions in a developed economy. Some attempt should be made to evaluate the importance of one of these roles.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For a competent comment with the emphasis on describing how commercial banks function and supporting this with some limited comment. There will be a very limited attempt to examine why commercial banks might be important in a developed economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>With the help of a circular flow diagram discuss how a policy of export led growth might affect the standard of living in a developing economy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Export led growth is dependent on an outward growth strategy which relies heavily on openness and increased international trade. Successful growth should lead to an increase in national income, output and employment.</p>
<p>Concentration on the expansion of exports should be a key factor determining an increase in aggregate demand, output and employment. This can be clearly illustrated, using a circular flow diagram which shows all withdrawals, all injections and the change in national income equilibrium achievable via export led economic growth. This diagram should be clearly labelled and accurate showing an increase in injections (exports) producing a bigger increase in output/income/employment via the multiplier .These increases should lead to a real increase in GDP per capita which should provide the potential for a rise in living standards by increasing access to more goods and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a developing economy is likely to rely heavily on the export of primary goods for which it would have a comparative advantage. The demand for such goods is likely to be income inelastic and the supply of such goods will be volatile because supply of such goods will vary significantly dependent upon changes in the weather. This means that changes in the growth rate might not be significant and the subsequent impact on the standard of living much reduced. Also it should be recognised that an increase in output, income and employment might not necessarily result in a significant increase in living standards. For example, it would depend upon how the additional income is distributed, possible loss of leisure time, might lead to lower long term economic growth due to focus on production and sale of primary products.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks):</strong> For a sound explanation of how export led growth can be analysed using an accurately labelled circular flow diagram. Links between the export led growth and potential benefits on the standard of living in developing countries should be clearly established. Evaluative comment should then be provided which questions the extent of the beneficial impact of this type of growth on the standard of living in a developing economy. A conclusion should be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (14–17 marks):</strong> For a clear analysis of the impact of export led growth on a developing economy, using a circular flow diagram. An attempt will be made to show how this growth might impact on living standards. Some attempt might be made to discuss the overall impact of export growth on living standards but points raised will be brief and not fully developed. Similarly, a brief, undeveloped conclusion might be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (10–13 marks):</strong> For a response which is descriptive rather than analytical. Answers might focus on factors which affect living standards in developing countries. A circular flow diagram will not be provided and there will be only a very limited attempt to link export led growth to changes in the standard of living in developing countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discuss the costs and benefits of a trade union intervening to influence the wages of workers in a specific occupation</strong></p>
<p>The main benefits associated with Trade Union intervention in the labour market would include: high wages due to collective bargaining; maintenance/improvement of working conditions and the maintenance of job security. The extent to which these objectives will be determined to some extent by the nature of the labour market in which they operate. In a perfectly competitive labour market analysis will focus on a situation where wage rates are determined by the supply of and the demand for labour. In this case trade unions can raise wages without loss of jobs, by increasing training and ultimately MRP. However, if wage increases are obtained by collective bargaining, which establishes a higher minimum wage, this might be achieved at a cost of significant job losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, in a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer. The loss of jobs and job security is likely to be the most significant cost in both cases. A conclusion should attempt to judge alternative situations where a net benefit/cost might arise.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks): </strong>For a sound discussion that recognises at least one cost and one benefit referring to a perfect labour and any imperfect labour market. Evaluative comment should attempt to compare the relative costs/benefits in each case and this should form the basis of a relevant conclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a competent comment with limited analysis that recognises costs and benefits but does not apply this analysis to both a perfect and an imperfect labour market. A brief conclusion might be provided but it will not be fully developed to allow a valid judgement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The introduction of a national minimum wage by a government will always benefit employees at the expense of employers.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement</strong></p>
<p>Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to introduce a minimum wage. Aims might include: to protect basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage imposed <strong>above the existing market equilibrium</strong>. This analysis can then be linked to the specific statement in the question by considering why the effect of an increase in wages will be different, depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case.&nbsp;<br><strong>‘always’</strong> is a key word in the statement and it is assumed that candidates will question whether this is acceptable. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit the employer as well as the employee. Also references to possible positive/negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, higher minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living. A conclusion should attempt to address the specific question based on preceding analysis.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks): </strong>At least 2 factors should be identified which support the assertion that employees will benefit from the imposition of a minimum wage. These benefits should be discussed using appropriate analysis. The extent to which these benefits are then attained at the expense of employers should then be fully discussed, referring to different types of labour market etc. A conclusion should attempt to make a judgement relating to whether the attained benefits are <strong>always</strong> gained at the expense of the employers.</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For competent analysis which clearly demonstrates the potential impact of a minimum wage on an employee via higher wages but is also aware that there are potential costs e.g. higher prices, job losses. Some brief comment might be provided regarding possible benefits gained by employers but this will not be fully developed. A conclusion addressing the specific question will not be provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Firms in perfect competition and firms in monopolistic competition will only achieve normal profits in the long run. This means that firms in both these types of market structure are equally efficient.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss, with the help of diagrams, the extent to which you agree with this statement.</strong></p>
<p>The main types of efficiency will be explained including: allocative efficiency, productive efficiency and possibly dynamic efficiency. Reference to the long run position in perfect competition in combination with definitions of efficiency should allow that firms in perfect competition will achieve both allocative and productive efficiency in the long run. Similarly, reference to a long run position in monopolistic competition using the same definitions of efficiency should enable candidates to conclude that a firm in monopolistic competition will not be allocatively efficient i.e. will not produce where AR=MC and it will not produce at the minimum point of its long run average total cost curve. Therefore it will not operate at an optimum level of output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers which point out that the firm in monopolistic competition will be operating at a productively efficient level of output in the long run are acceptable provided it is clear that the definition of productive efficiency is stated as 'the minimum unit cost attainable for a given level of output'. A conclusion would point out that a perfectly competitive firm is therefore likely to be more efficient than it monopolistically competitive counterpart. Good responses might refer to dynamic efficiency and given the small size of firms in both types of market structure, neither firm would be able to benefit from this type of efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a clear explanation of the concept of normal profit and an analysis of the long run positions of both types of firms, supported by clear, accurately labelled diagrams. A clear understanding allocative and productive efficiency. An attempt to evaluate the accuracy of the claim under consideration by comparing the two long run outcomes. A conclusion which points out that the statement is incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For an accurate reference to the question and clear understanding two types of efficiency and an attempt to link these different types of efficiency to different long run positions of both types of firm but with a more limited evaluation of the differences in efficiency between the two firms in the long run. Analysis of how the long run positions are attained will be also less well developed. #&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For a briefer descriptive comment that examines two types of efficiency and applies these concepts to both types of firm in the long run. Diagrams might not be accurate and it is not clear how the long run position has been attained. Does not use these differences in long run outcomes to discuss the validity of the view under consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Interdependence is a key characteristic of oligopoly firms. This creates a problem regarding the pricing decisions made by such firms.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explain this statement and discuss the extent to which game theory can help to solve this problem.</strong></p>
<p>Answers should explain what economists mean by ‘interdependence’ in relation to an Oligopoly market structure. Oligopolies will be large firms with a high concentration ratio. This means that the pricing and output decisions of any one of these firms is likely to have a significant impact on profits, market share and growth of their main competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example might be illustrated by reference to the kinked demand curve and the link between price changes and changes in total revenue. This also emphasises the need to avoid price wars where all firms risk a fall in profits while the consumer benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game theory, which uses the idea of a maxi-min strategy and refers to the ‘Prisoners Dilemma’ as an example, can be used by an Oligopoly firm to promote the idea of collusion to choose a price which will maximise revenue. There are alternatives to this approach. For example, the market price may be set by the dominant firm while the remaining firms follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tacit collusion might take place where the market price is set by ’rules of thumb’ such as average cost pricing. Thus although Game theory is undoubtedly useful to Oligopoly firms, there are a number of alternative approaches which might also be successfully adopted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For a response which explains the concept of interdependence in relation to the specific market structure of Oligopoly. The kinked demand curve should be used to illustrate the pricing problem. A clear analysis of the use of Game theory should be used to discuss a potential solution to this problem. At least one alternative pricing approach should be discussed. A conclusion should provide a judgement upon the specific statement under discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a competent analysis of the importance of interdependence in relation to Oligopoly pricing, which incorporates the theory of the kinked demand curve and identifies why this constitutes a problem. An attempt might be made to explain Game theory but this will not be clearly identified as a solution to the specific problem. There will be no attempt to consider whether Game theory might represent the only solution.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks): </strong>For a brief, descriptive approach which refers to interdependence and the kinked demand curve or interdependence and Game theory but does not attempt to link the three concepts to address the specific question&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–4 marks):</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what economists mean by a public good and discuss why the provision of such a good is associated with market failure.</strong></p>
<p>Answers should provide a clear explanation of the meaning of a public good. Key characteristics: non rival; non excludable should be identified. Some reference to non- divisible/non-rejectable might also be referred to. Examples provided might include: street lighting/national defence/lighthouse&nbsp;</p>
<p>The link between the characteristics of a public good and the difficulty associated with the provision of such a good by the free market should be established i.e. the ‘free rider problem’ Market failure should be discussed in the context of allocative inefficiency. Allocative efficiency is attained when resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction. If public goods are not provided, consumer satisfaction is unlikely to be maximised, hence unless the State provides public goods, market failure will occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains the key characteristics of a public good and analyses the links between allocative efficiency and the concept of market failure. An attempt should be made to evaluate the potential impact on total consumer satisfaction if certain public are not provided. A conclusion should be provided which might comment on the importance of public goods and how a government can help to address this type of potential market failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a competent comment which clearly defines the concept of a public good and market failure together with limited elaboration of the analysis or imprecise links in the argument. Evaluation will not be fully developed and no attempt will be made to provide a conclusion to summarize the preceding argument.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks):</strong> For a limited explanation of the key terms but weak or illexplained links between these terms. The explanation will be undeveloped with some attempt at analysis but the emphasis will be on descriptive comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discuss the extent to which monopoly producers and the consumers of their products might benefit from the existence of barriers to entry.</strong></p>
<p>Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the state might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Potential benefits to the monopolist might include: higher profits; increase in efficiency; increase in market share; growth of the firm. The consumer benefits might include: lower prices; higher quality product; greater availability of a product.</p>
<p>Responses might refer to a range of alternative barriers to entry including: economies of scale; branding/advertising; legal requirements/patents; natural monopolies; limit pricing. Good responses will choose at least two types of barrier and discuss how each might have a positive/negative effect on both the producer and the consumer. For example, economies of scale might increase Monopoly profits by lowering unit costs but also benefit the consumer by possible subsequent price reductions. Similarly, the use of limit pricing to prevent new entrants might lower prices for the consumer in the short run but lead to a higher market share and higher profits in the long run.</p>
<p>On a more general note, some barriers might allow a monopolist to maintain profits in the long run and invest in research and development thus achieving dynamic efficiency. These benefits might by be passed on to the consumer through lower prices, higher quality products and more choice. Alternatively, barriers might lead to complacency and X inefficiency which is likely to lead to higher prices and lower quality products.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks):</strong> For a clear, explanation of two barriers to entry and a discussion of how each of the barriers might have both a negative and positive effect on the producer and the consumer. An attempt should be made to summarize the extent to which producers/consumers might achieve a net benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks):</strong> For a fair explanation of two barriers which focuses upon either the potential costs/benefits to the producer or consumer only or an explanation which does not attempt to examine both costs and benefits in both cases. A brief conclusion referring to the extent of the costs/benefits might be made.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks): </strong>For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of different types of barrier to entry but does not identify specific costs/benefits and does not distinguish clearly between costs/benefits to the producer and costs/benefits to the consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–4 marks):</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.</p>

<p>The G7 is a group of countries that have some of the world's major advanced economies. Productivity in the G7 countries varies, as shown in Fig. 1.1 below, with United Kingdom (UK) performance as the base index of 100.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./AL Econ MS only_files/c921b190334711eda2e300163e02ecea-1663061892.png" alt="" width="442" height="342"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1: Gross domestic product per hour worked, G7 countries, for 2015 and 2016</strong></p>
<p>Productivity in the UK was one of the worst in the G7. Poor management practices and lower levels of skills in the workforce were the main reasons for the UK’s position. In low wage, high employment sectors of the UK economy, the performance compared unfavourably with five of the G7 countries. In retailing, the UK was 40% lower than the performance in the United States (US). In hospitality industries the UK had a 45% lower rate than France.</p>
<p>Tackling poor productivity is about innovation, investment and improving infrastructure as well as labour skills.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of the US suggested that innovation is one of the keys to productivity differences among the G7 countries. Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&amp;D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.</p>
<p>In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&amp;D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&amp;D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.</p>
<p>There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK. This made some UK industries, such as car production, vulnerable. The central bank in the UK has stated that foreign owned car manufacturers in the UK invest heavily in R&amp;D and their presence boosts the productivity of labour. It was thought this may change in the future.</p>

<p>Cost-push inflation is the outcome of a rise in the costs of production. This results in a shift to the left of the AS curve, increasing the price level. Possible causes could be an increase in wages above the rate of inflation, an increase in raw material costs or an increase in the price of fuel imports due to the depreciation of the currency</p>
<p>Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in aggregate demand not matched by an increase in aggregate supply. This will have a strong effect if the economy is at or close to the level of full employment. The cause could be an increase in government spending, a reduction in taxation leading to a consumer boom or an increase in demand for exports following a depreciation of the currency.</p>

<p>Monetary policy involves measures that influence the price or quantity of money. These include interest rates and the money supply. In some countries exchange rate policy is included. Interest rate changes though have tended to be the main policy used to control the rate of inflation in most countries. In theory, an increase in the rate of interest should encourage more saving by consumers and less funding for investment by businesses. If effective, an increase in interest rates should reduce the rate of inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiscal policy can also be used. This involves increasing taxation or reducing government spending to reduce inflation. Both measures are at the cost of increasing the level of unemployment. Supply side policies are also possible, especially if there are structural weaknesses in an economy.</p>

<p>Merit goods have positive side effects when consumed. They are provided because of information failure which can lead to under consumption and under production. Consumers of things like education and healthcare do not perceive the true benefits usually because they do not have either any information or true information. Therefore, the government often provides merit goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merit goods in many countries are provided by the private sector as well as the public sector. This is often because the cost of provision to the public sector is too great or because the cost cannot be met in full. The case of healthcare is important in most low and middleincome countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global consumption of avocados has increased in the last few years, particularly in the United States (US) but also in China and parts of Europe. This growth is largely due to the increasing popularity of ‘guacamole’ (smashed avocado) and the health benefits claimed for its regular consumption. The US is the largest importer of avocados with supplies coming mainly from Central and South American producers as shown in Fig. 1.1.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.1: US Avocado imports by country, 2010 to 2018</strong></p>
<p>The supply of avocados is unpredictable. It is estimated that to produce one kilogram of avocado requires 2000 litres of water. Consequently, production is highly susceptible to drought conditions such as those that affected Central American growers in 2018. When this happens, the price of avocados increases as shown in Fig. 1.2.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fig. 1.2: Wholesale price of Mexican avocados in the US,</strong><br><strong>January to July 2019 (pesos per 10kg box)</strong></p>
<p>A shortage in supply provides an opportunity for new producers to enter the global market. Kenya, for example, has expanded its productive capacity and signed an agreement to supply the Chinese market. Even some New Zealand farmers switched from dairy to avocado production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global market for avocados is expected to continue to grow over the next few years. Rising prices will continue to increase production. It should be recognised, however, that there are increasing objections to higher production. In Mexico, for example, farmers have cleared forests to cultivate more avocados. This has put a strain on water supplies and raised concerns about the effects of the farmers’ actions on climate change. These concerns have led one market research report to conclude that ‘the price mechanism is not working to allocate resources successfully.’</p>

<p>A growth in the productive capacity of an economy is represented by a shift outward in the PPC. It can be caused by an improvement of technology or an increase in productive resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A reduction in the quantity of unused resources in an economy is represented by a movement from within the PPC towards the curve. It can be caused for example by increased aggregate demand or by an improvement in the aggregate supply that makes the labour market more efficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disadvantages of a planned economy may include a lack of consumer sovereignty. A lack of profit motive which may lead to less efficiency. It may therefore lead to surpluses and / or shortages. It may lack incentives e.g., to invest which may lead to a lack of innovation and a reduction in consumer choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transition to an economy in which many resources are allocated by market forces may counter the disadvantages of a planned economy through market forces but it may also lead to the overproduction of demerit goods and the underproduction of merit goods together with a lack of public goods. It may lead to greater inequality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fall in the price of oil is likely to reduce the value of Russia’s exports and have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments, but this is only the case if the PeD is inelastic. A possible opportunity is that costs of production will fall for domestic firms that use oil and this may impact the Russian economy by making its exports more price competitive,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of the fall in the value of the rouble could be positive or negative depending upon the PED of Russia's imports and exports. There is a threat however that will result from the possible imported inflation and this may impact the Russian economy by lowering living standards.</p>

<p>The relatively high rate of inflation has been caused by price rises in both the food and the nonfood sectors. In terms of the food sector, there have been significant rises in the price of fish, chicken and vegetables, particularly onions. In terms of the non-food sector, price rises have been significant in healthcare, transport and energy resources such as gas.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Government is concerned about the possible consequences of a relatively high rate of inflation. It has now therefore set an annual inflation rate target of 5.5%.</p>
<p>The central bank of Bangladesh has the maintenance of price stability as one of its main objectives. It uses monetary policy to control the rate of increase of prices in the country. However, there is always the possibility that tough monetary policies could do more harm than good to an economy, compared with the possible use of fiscal policy.</p>
<p>The central bank recognises that inflation can be caused by both demand-pull and cost-push factors in the economy. A particular cause of inflation is the increase in wages. The Wage Rate Index (WRI) rose in December 2019 by 6.6% compared with a 6.4% rise in the index in November.</p>

<p><strong>Consider, with the help of a circular flow diagram, the potential impact of a fall in the rate of interest on the level of output and the level of employment.</strong></p>
<p>Candidates should produce an accurate, clearly labelled, three sector circular flow diagram. Injections and withdrawals should be clearly identified. The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained. Also the links between expenditure, output and employment should be explained. The full employment level of income, expenditure and output should be labelled on the diagram. Analysis should then examine the potential impact of a fall in the rate of interest on withdrawals. For example, savings and imports, or injections for example, investment and exports. The extent of the potential impact should be discussed in each case. For example, a fall in interest rates is likely to reduce the level of savings and increase the level of consumer spending. This will produce higher levels of expenditure, output and employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the overall impact will also be affected by any subsequent change in the multiplier effect. If the marginal propensity to save falls significantly, the multiplier will increase and the overall impact on output and employment will be substantial. The impact on investment (injection) will also depend upon factors such as the interest elasticity of investment and/or the current level of confidence of potential investors. Reference might be made to the importance of locating the current state of the economy before the fall in the rate of interest takes place. If there is a lot of existing spare capacity, the impact of a fall in interest rates on output and employment is likely to be significant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> for an answer which uses circular flow theory to analyse the relationship between expenditure, income, output and employment. Analysis should be supported by an appropriate diagram. The impact of a fall in the rate of interest should be considered in relation to at least one withdrawal and one injection. Some evaluative comment should be provided in each case. A conclusion should be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> for analysis which explains the circular flow model and identifies withdrawals and injections. Full employment equilibrium will also be identified. Analysis will focus upon either one withdrawal or one injection but it should be supported by a diagram and at least one evaluative comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> for a less well-developed comment which describes the circular flow of income and identifies withdrawals and injections and makes some reference to the full employment level of income. There will be no evidence of analysis which examines the impact of a fall in the rate of interest on either withdrawals or injections. Diagrams might not be accurately labelled.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–4 marks)</strong> for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.</p>

<p><strong>Discuss whether there is likely to be a conflict when a government attempts to fix exchange rates while at the same time introducing policies to decrease the level of inflation.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Governments can adopt a fixed exchange rate policy and maintain a fixed exchange rate in conjunction with direct intervention by a central bank in the foreign exchange market. If there is downward pressure on the external value of the domestic currency due to a balance of payments deficit, the central bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market by using its reserves of foreign currency to purchase domestic currency. This will prevent the fall in external value of the domestic currency. If the balance of payments is in surplus, the central bank will sell domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. If a government makes a formal announcement that it is going to fix the exchange rate at a lower rate, this is a de-valuation. Attempts to fix the currency at a higher rate would constitute a re-valuation. When exchange rates are fixed, the main instruments of monetary policy would be changes in interest rates and/or changes in the money supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if interest rates are raised to reduce aggregate monetary demand, to reduce the level of inflation, this will produce short term capital inflows which will put upward pressure on the domestic currency. To maintain the fixed exchange rate the central bank will sell the domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. This will increase the money supply which is likely to then make it more difficult to reduce the level of inflation. Thus it is likely that there will be a conflict when a government attempts to fix exchange rates and control inflation at the same time. Alternative approaches may use supply side policies which might reduce inflation without having a significant impact on the balance of payments. Although it is possible that such policies might still make exports more competitive and therefore still create problems maintaining fixed exchange rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks)</strong> for a clear explanation of what is meant by fixed exchange rates and the process which is used by a government and central bank to achieve fixed rates. Alternative monetary policies used to reduce inflation should be explained. Analysis should then establish the link between antiinflationary policies and exchange rates which should also clearly identify why there might be potential conflict. A conclusion might consider possible approaches which might avoid the negative effects of this conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> for a description of what is meant by fixed exchange rates and a consideration of alternative types of monetary policy. A link should be established between a fixed exchange rate policy and the success/failure of monetary policy but the analysis will not be full developed and there will be no attempt to consider possible solutions to this conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> for a competent comment with the emphasis on describing what is meant by fixed exchange rates and explaining different monetary policy approaches. The link between monetary policy and fixed exchange rates will not be recognised and no attempt will be made to identify any potential conflict between these two policy approaches.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Government policies which rely on increasing budget deficits to solve the problem of unemployment will not be successful because they do not affect the natural rate of unemployment.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Budget deficits used to solve the problem of unemployment are generally associated with Keynesian demand management policies. This policy approach is adopted to address the specific problem of cyclical unemployment where there is insufficient aggregate monetary demand in an economy. A budget deficit will produce net government spending which, in conjunction with the multiplier effect of this spending can lead to an increase in monetary demand which will solve the problem of cyclical unemployment. At this point it is assumed that the labour market is in equilibrium. However, natural unemployment relates to those workers who remain unemployed even though the labour market is in equilibrium. This is primarily due to market frictions on the labour market which lead to frictional and structural unemployment. In this situation, policies which rely upon budget deficits stimulating aggregate demand are unlikely to be successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative policies which focus upon the supply of labour are more appropriate. For example, Trade Union reform, reducing taxes on profits, subsidising new growth industries, might be used. Therefore, to some extent the statement in question is correct. It should however be also noted that increasing budget deficits might still fail to solve the problem of unemployment regardless of the impact of the natural rate of unemployment. For example, a budget deficit might lead to higher interest rates which might have a negative effect on investment, aggregate demand and employment. In addition, a budget deficit might lead to an increase in the money supply which might cause inflation and the further loss of jobs in the long run. A conclusion should refer to the above which suggests that the statement in question is only partially correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks)</strong> for a clear analysis of the relationship between an increase in a budget deficit and a reduction in unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment should be explained and linked to the specific question. Evaluation comment should be provided to establish the extent to which one might agree with the statement in question. A conclusion should be provided based on the preceding analysis/evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (14–17 marks)</strong> for accurate but only partially developed analysis based on the theory of cyclical unemployment and an explanation of natural unemployment. A limited attempt will be made to link the relationship between these two types of unemployment to the specific question. No evaluative comment will be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (10–13 marks)</strong> for a mainly descriptive comment which links budget deficits to cyclical unemployment and explains what is meant by the natural rate of unemployment but does not link this comment to the specific question.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Many developing countries rely heavily on the production and export of primary products. This is the main cause of low levels of economic growth in developing countries and therefore the main explanation for the low standard of living in these countries.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Candidates should address three elements of this question. First, it is true that many developing countries do rely heavily on the production and export of primary goods. The nature of this type of good usually means that demand for exports is likely to be inelastic because food is essential and the supply of primary goods is likely to fluctuate considerably due to changes in the weather causing significant changes in both market prices and changes in income. This reliance on the production of primary goods plus relatively small secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary sectors has to be the main source of economic growth. The relatively low level of economic growth is primarily due to low levels of investment and low levels of productivity in the primary sector. Low growth may also be caused by low levels of savings associated with low levels of income in the primary sector which make it difficult for the financial system to provide sufficient funding for capital investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it should be recognised that there are other factors which might contribution to low growth rates in developing countries. For example, low levels of investment in training and education. The third part of the response should question the relationship between a low level of economic growth and a low standard of living in developing countries. It should be pointed out that sometimes high growth rates might lead to a fall in living standards, for example the effect of negative externalities. Also living standards are not measured entirely upon the availability of goods and services and this can be illustrated by referring to other measures of living standards which do not focus on economic growth. A conclusion might discuss the extent to which each part of the statement can be supported by the preceding analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks)</strong> for a sound explanation of why the relationship between primary goods and opportunities to achieve economic growth. At least one example of the link between the export of primary goods and a low rate of economic growth. Some evaluative comment should be made in relation to the extent to which rates of economic growth can be used to indicate changes in the standard of living. A conclusion should be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (14–17 marks)</strong> for a clear analysis of the potential impact of export led growth on an undeveloped economy. An attempt will be made to show why this growth might be difficult to attain. Some attempt might be made to discuss the overall impact of export growth on living standards but points raised will be brief and not fully developed.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (10–13 marks)</strong> for a response which is descriptive rather than analytical. Answers might focus on factors which affect living standards in undeveloped countries. There will be only a very limited attempt to explain why export led growth based on primary products might be difficult. Links between growth and changes in the standard of living in developing countries will not be developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–9 marks)</strong> for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.</p>

<p><strong>A profit maximising firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market might decide to increase the number of workers it employs but it will not choose to increase its workers' wage rates.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.</strong></p>
<p>Key assumptions which underpin the theory of a perfectly competitive labour market should include: homogeneous labour; perfect mobility of labour, no barriers to entry, firms are wage takers; perfect knowledge. A profit maximising firm operating in this market will employ labour up to the point where the marginal product of labour is equal to the wage paid to labour. An explanation of the link between MRP and the demand for labour should be provided. It should also be noted that the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at a wage determined by the market forces of supply of and demand for labour. If the productivity of workers within the firm increases or the price received by this firm increase, then the demand for labour will rise and more workers will be employed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the wage rate will not change. If a firm in perfect competition allowed an increase in its worker's wages it would no longer maximise profits at the new level of output. Therefore this would support the statement in the question. Similarly, if a firm in a perfectly competitive labour market decided to raise wages with an increase in MRP, profits would only be maximised if the level of employment fell. It should be recognised in a conclusion that both wages and employment could rise at the same time if any of the conditions which determine market demand or market supply change. In this case each firm will receive a perfectly elastic supply of labour at a higher wage rate.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> for a sound discussion that explains what is meant by a perfectly competitive labour market and how the profit maximising level of employment will be determined based on the supply of and demand for labour by the firm. Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the statement in the question might be true. A conclusion should refer to and consider the relationship between the labour market and the supply of labour to each firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> for a competent comment with limited analysis that recognises what constitutes a perfect labour market and the profit maximising level of employment in this market. Some attempt might be made to address the specific question but the analysis will not be fully developed. No conclusion will be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> for an attempt which describes a perfectly competitive labour market and makes a limited attempt to explain how a firm in such a market might maximise profits but does not discuss why the demand for labour might change or why employment might rise but wages will not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The government of a country sets an effective national minimum wage for workers.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the arguments for and against the government's decision.</strong></p>
<p>Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to increase the minimum wage. Aims might include: to increase basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage, which will be different depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case. Potential benefits to the macro economy might be discussed. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit employers and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>However, depending upon the type of market, referred to above, such a minimum wage might lead to significant job losses. Also, this policy might lead to a significant increase in government expenditure which might have to be financed by higher levels of taxation. Additional references to possible negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, a minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living. A conclusion should attempt to address the specific question based on preceding analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks)</strong> Factors should be identified that support a government’s decision to set a national minimum wage and factors that refer to the potential cost associated with such a decision. (Either 2 factors for, and 1 against. OR 1 factor for and 2 against). Points raised should be used in an analytical approach rather than simply focusing on descriptive comment. A conclusion should be provided which attempts to summarize the arguments for and against.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> for competent explanation of the impact of an increase in the national minimum wage supported by analysis which clearly demonstrates the potential impact. Either 1 factor for and 1 against with and analytical comment OR 3 factors (2+1 or 1 +2) with only a descriptive comment.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (5–6 marks)</strong> for a brief and descriptive explanation of the potential costs/benefits (1+1) of an increase in the national minimum wage but this will not be supported by any in-depth analysis. There will be no attempt to summarize the overall impact of this decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what economists mean by indifference curves and budget lines and evaluate whether they might be used together to support rational consumer decision making.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Indifference curves describe all the combinations of two goods which when consumed will give an equal level of consumer satisfaction. This is why consumers are indifferent regarding which point on the curve they might attain. Typical indifference curves will be convex to the origin and downward sloping from left to right. Budget lines establish all the combinations of two goods which can be purchased given the price of each good and subject to an income constraint. This will be a straight line, sloping downwards from left to right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A consumer will be considered to be in equilibrium when maximum consumer satisfaction is attained. This is when the consumer is able to reach a point on the furthest indifference curve from the origin while spending all their available income. On a diagram it is where the consumer budget line is at a tangent with this indifference curve. It is important to note that this point can only be attained by rational consumer decision making. This assumes: consumers always want to maximise satisfaction, that consumers can measure the total satisfaction obtained when consuming a combination of goods and that no external influences, for example advertising, might lead to irrational decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> for a clear explanation of the concept of an indifference curve and a budget line. This might be supported by the use of clearly labelled accurate diagrams.

<p><strong>Use indifference theory to analyse the view that the demand for an inferior good is likely to be more price inelastic than the demand for a normal good.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Candidates should recognise the assumptions which underpin indifference theory and how these assumptions relate to consumer desire to maximise satisfaction by buying a combination of goods which is consistent with consumer equilibrium. Explanation of a normal good should be provided. Analysis should then attempt to explain the impact of a change in price. This effect can be divided into a substitution effect and an income effect. Further price changes can then be used to construct the relationship between a change in price and a subsequent change in demand. This can be done using verbal description or by the use of accurately labelled diagrams plus relevant description. The link between indifference analysis, price change, a normal good and the shape of the demand curve should be clearly established.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar approach can be used i.e. using the relative impact of the substitution effect and income effect, to show the link between a price change, an inferior good and the shape of the demand curve. The overall effect on the elasticity of demand for each type of good should then be made by discussing the impact of the negative effect on the elasticity of demand for the inferior good. Verbal description and/or description plus diagrams would be acceptable. A conclusion should refer to the extent to which the view in question might be correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks)</strong> for a response which uses indifference analysis to differentiate between a normal good and an inferior good. In each case the analysis should establish the link between price changes and their effect on the consumer's demand curve. This analysis should then be used to comment on the view in question. A conclusion should summarize the analysis and make some reference to alternative types of good.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L3 (7–8 marks)</strong> for a competent analysis, including income and substitution effects. of the links between indifference theory, different types of good and why some goods might be more inelastic than others. A conclusion may be provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explain what is meant by dynamic efficiency and consider which type of market structure is most likely to achieve dynamic efficiency.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Answers should provide a clear explanation of the meaning of dynamic efficiency which refers to the use of profits to re-invest in research and development to reduce long run average total costs. The effect on a firm’s long run average total cost curve should be clearly explained. And existing average total cost will move entirely in a downwards direction, showing that as a result of investment, the firm has now reduced its average total cost curve at every level of output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are four types of market structure. Firms operating in a perfectly competitive market and firms operating in a monopolistically competitive market are unlikely to be able to achieve dynamic efficiency. This is primarily due to both types of market consisting of small firms which make it very difficult to gain sufficient profits to enable investment in research and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, monopoly and oligopoly firms are likely to be large and be able to generate sufficient profits to benefit from investment in research and development and gain dynamic efficiency. It is more likely that a monopoly will generate sufficient profits because they will have full market control whereas an oligopoly might need to use profits to use non price competition to maintain their market share. Although it should also be recognised that some monopolies might simply use profits to increase shareholder dividends or dynamic efficiency might not be achieved due to X inefficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–12 marks)</strong> For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains, the concept and analysis of dynamic efficiency. Each of the three main types of market structure should be discussed and an attempt should be made to conclude which market is most likely to achieve dynamic market efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

No attempt will be made to evaluate which type of market structure is most likely to achieve dynamic efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The use of cars in large cities can cause traffic congestion and pollution.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explain how the use of cars may cause allocative inefficiency and discuss <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> alternative government policies that might be used to solve this problem.</strong></p>
<p>Allocative inefficiency occurs when a good/service is over/under produced which prevents an outcome which will maximize consumer satisfaction. Motor cars can cause traffic congestion and pollution which both contribute towards producing an allocatively inefficient outcome. Congestion is associated with slower transport/distribution and this causes inefficiency. Pollution produces negative externalities which are additional costs which are not incurred by the user of motor cars but which have to be borne by society in general. When these additional costs are not taken into account, more motor cars are produced, sold and used than would otherwise be the case, therefore allocative efficiency in relation to the amount of resources used to produce cars is not achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of alternative government policies which can be used to address the overproduction of cars. Policies might include: taxation, legislation, regulation, advertising, subsidising alternative methods of transport. Each policy can be evaluated. For example, subsidising alternative forms of transport might be costly and the cross elasticity of demand for motor cars and alternative forms of transport might be very low.</p>
<p><strong>L4 (9–13 marks)</strong> for a clear, explanation of allocative efficiency and the link between motor car use, traffic congestion, pollution, negative externalities and allocative inefficiency. Two government policies should be identified to address this problem and at least one evaluative comment in each case should be provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.</p>
<p>There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.</p>
<p>For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.</p>
<p>It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.</p>
<p>In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.</p>
<p>In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.</p>
<p>In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'</p>
<p>In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey's central bank expected to cut interest rates for 10th time in a row</strong></p>
<p>Turkey's central bank is expected to approve a further reduction in interest rates. Most economists predict that interest rates will fall. However, some wonder whether rates will continue to fall or whether the bank may soon need to raise them to reduce inflation. Turkey's central bank has cut the interest rate from 24% in July 2019. It is now expected that the rate will be cut to 8%.</p>
<p>Annual consumer price inflation was 8.6% in October 2019 and is now 11.4%, reducing the international competitiveness of Turkey's goods and services. This means that if the rate of interest is cut to 8%, the real interest rate will be negative.</p>
<p>The real interest rate in Turkey, calculated by subtracting annual inflation, is among the lowest in the world. It is negative at –3.4% compared with –0.6% in the Euro area and –0.3% in South Africa. The negative rate in Turkey discourages foreign investors from lending to the Turkish government, potentially affecting the value of Turkey's currency, the lira. The currency fell to a record low of 7.3 per US dollar in early May, mainly due to concerns over the level of interest rates.</p>
<p>Analysts differ over whether the expected interest rate cut will be the central bank's last or whether it will continue to reduce borrowing costs. Some think it will generate inflation as the economy recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, others are suggesting that the bank may continue to cut the interest rate because the Turkish government appears determined to do everything it can to speed up the economic recovery.</p>

Measurement would require a monetary measure of the value of GDP using either income, expenditure, or output method. Importance relates to the relationship between changes in measured real GDP, changes in wealth and subsequent changes in living standards. Also, this measurement allows some assessment of the performance of those responsible for managing the economy and for those attempting to compare national economic performance with main international competitors<br><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> for an answer that attempts to explain how a government measures economic growth and then discusses why this measurement is important.

<p>In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.</p>
<p>A critic of this free movement of labour stated that "It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages."</p>
<p>In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported "There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services. Wages may have been affected for low-skilled workers but only marginally downward."</p>
<p>Other economists have argued that, in theory, "the impacts of immigration on wages and employment critically depends on whether migrants' skills are complements to, or substitutes for, the skills of existing workers. These impacts vary between the short run and long run. In the short run if the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages. If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in wages of existing workers. In the long run the economy can adjust to the increase in labour supply."</p>
<p>Some governments have introduced a minimum wage to help those workers on low pay. The wage is set to increase to match any increase in inflation.</p>

<p>In the sixteen months to April 2019 thirteen airlines ceased trading in Europe. This reflected a global trend where small airlines found it increasingly difficult to compete against large airlines, which have continued to grow.</p>
<p>Large airlines charge a price for a flight that includes meals and entertainment for passengers. Smaller airlines charge a price for the flight only and passengers need to pay extra for other services such as meals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large airlines benefit from economies of scale. Without these cost-reductions some smaller airlines have gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>The reduction in the number of airlines has not reduced the overcapacity in the market because the aircrew and aircraft of the bankrupt airlines were acquired by the remaining companies, which have developed into super-airlines. This has left passengers with fewer airlines to choose from and more expensive fares. It was predicted that this would lead to an increase in the market share for the top five European airlines from 50% of the European market in 2019 to match the top five United States (US) airlines, which control 77% of the US market.</p>
<p>The development of super-airlines took place at the same time as increasing regulation of the airline market. For example, the European Union (EU) will only grant operating licences for flights between EU countries to an EU airline. This has prevented non-EU airlines from competing on EU routes.</p>
<p>For the super-airlines, large scale is the easy way to avoid the stresses and strains of open competition. For passengers this will lead to higher prices and poorer service.</p>

The key elements of the equation i.e. MV = PT should be provided, and each variable should be explained. The monetarist explanation of the use of this equation to explain the cause of inflation should be discussed and the key assumptions necessary to support this theory should be identified. It is important to recognise the monetarist approach which assumes that V and T are constant/stable. Based on this formula and assumptions, the theory predicts a direct relation between changes in the money supply and changes in inflation.&nbsp;<br>However, the predictions of the theory are not always borne out in practice. In practice it could be argued that: it is very difficult to identify a precise measure of the money supply; the velocity of circulation is not always constant; T is the full employment level of output which also not always the case; sometimes it is changes in the demand for money which cause changes in the money supply, this undermines the basic premise of the theory.&nbsp;<br>A conclusion should be provided based on the preceding argument.&nbsp;<br><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a sound explanation of the Quantity Theory of Money which identifies the relevant equation and explains the component parts.

<td style="width: 684px; height: 10px;"><strong>Explain what economists mean by the marginal propensity to consume and consider the importance of this concept in relation to government macroeconomic policy.</strong><br>An individual's marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the proportion of any additional income received by the individual which is spent on consumption. Basic Keynesian economic theory assumes that the marginal propensity to consume remains constant regardless of the level of an individual's level of income. It is more realistic to assume that the marginal propensity to consume will fall as individual income increases.&nbsp;<br>Government macroeconomic policy focuses on key goals, including: high employment; high growth; low/stable inflation; stable balance of payments/exchange rate; re-distributing income. It is possible to link the concept of marginal propensity to consume to each of these key goals. For example, a government may increase expenditure to increase aggregate demand to increase output and employment. The ultimate impact of this additional expenditure will be determined by the multiplier effect which in turn, will be determined by the value of the marginal propensity to consume.&nbsp;<br>Also, due to this multiplier effect, some of the subsequent further increase in income might be spent on purchasing imports and this is likely to have a negative impact on the balance of payments.<br><strong>L4 (9–12 marks):</strong> For a response which clearly explains the concept of the marginal propensity to consume. An attempt should be made to analyse the importance of the MPC in relation to the use of government policy to achieve at least three macroeconomic goals.

Candidates might refer to: the proportion of labour costs in relation to a firm's total cost; the ease with which labour can be substituted by capital; the elasticity of the demand for the product produced; the time period under consideration.&nbsp;<br>An attempt should then be made to link these factors in relation to a government’s minimum wage policy. For example, labour operating in a monopolistically competitive market is likely to be producing a product which has an elastic demand. This means that if the imposition of a minimum wage leads to higher prices, there will be a significant decrease in the demand for the product and subsequently, a significant rise in unemployment. This suggests that a government minimum wage policy will have a substantially negative effect on the labour market.&nbsp;<br>A similar approach might be adopted in relation to other factors referred to above. A conclusion should comment that the effectiveness of policy will depend upon the factor under consideration but also other factors should be taken into account, for example, the elasticity of supply of labour.<br><strong>L4 (9 ̶ 12 marks):</strong> For a clear explanation and analysis of at least two factors which might determine the elasticity of the demand for labour.

<td style="width: 678px; height: 659px;"><strong>'The cause and extent of market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure under consideration.'</strong><br><strong>Discuss this statement.&nbsp;</strong><br>Market failure can be divided into two main areas. One area would link market failure to the type of good in consideration. This would include: merit goods, demerit goods and public goods. Alternatively market failure can also be linked to different types of market structure which would include: monopolistic competition, oligopoly and monopoly. All cases of market failure will be closely related to allocative and productive inefficiency.&nbsp;<br>Candidates should begin by attempting to discuss the extent to which market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure. Evidence should be provided which shows that some market structures, for example Monopoly can clearly be associated with market failure, in that equilibrium output in this type of market frequently produces both allocative inefficiency and X inefficiency. Similar conclusions might also be linked to other types of imperfect markets. However, it should also be recognised that positive and negative externalities associated respectively with merit and demerit good will also produce allocatively inefficient outcomes.&nbsp;<br>Public goods might also be discussed in that their unique characteristics will lead to non-provision in a free market due to the free rider problem. Based on the above, a conclusion should be provided which questions the validity of the statement in its entirety.&nbsp;<br><strong>L4 (18 ̶ 25 marks):</strong> For a reasoned and clear discussion that identifies at least two types of market failure and discusses this using at least two types of market structure and two types of good or service. Analysis of the links will be combined with some evaluative comment relating to whether the cause of market failure depends <strong>entirely</strong> upon the type of market structure under consideration. A reasoned conclusion should be provided. Must mention efficiency to access L4 <br>21 maximum if no conclusion.&nbsp;<br><strong>L3 (14 ̶ 17 marks):</strong> For a developed comment together with limited analysis of different market structures and different types of product. There should be some discussion but the evaluation will not focus on whether market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure under consideration.&nbsp;<br><strong>L2 (10 ̶ 13 marks):</strong> For a brief explanation but weak or ill-explained links. The explanation will be undeveloped with some attempt at analysis but the emphasis will be on descriptive comment and the key element of the question will not be addressed.&nbsp;<br><strong>L1 (1 ̶ 9 marks):</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.</td>

<p>Some governments have agreed targets to reduce air pollution and, as part of this, are concerned about the social costs caused by the use of petrol and diesel vehicles. In response, car manufacturers are producing all-electric cars. The sales of these are increasing, especially in developed countries. The success of this switch to all-electric cars will depend on improving both battery technology as well as building an infrastructure in which, as drivers reduce their use of fossil fuels, electricity charging points will replace petrol pumps.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 shows the cumulative number of all-electric cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./AL Econ MS only_files/df8986448b1111ec805400163e02ecea-1644566942.png" alt="" width="511" height="269"></p>
<p>Fig. 1.2 shows the annual sales of all cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./AL Econ MS only_files/f85e58b68b1111eca2ac00163e02ecea-1644566983.png" alt="" width="477" height="304"></p>
<p>Some forecasters predict that about one third of the world’s cars will be all-electric by 2040. Their forecasts are based on the assumption that the costs of batteries to run these cars will have declined steeply from their present levels. Battery costs are dependent on supplies of various metals which are used as component parts. Supplies of these metals are finite and their prices, linked to mining costs, will be crucial in increasing the scale of all-electric car production.</p>
<p>In 2016, the cost of the batteries was 49% of the total cost of the car. In 2017 it was stated at a New Energy conference in Shanghai that battery prices would need to drop by more than half before all-electric cars would become competitive with cars powered by petrol and diesel engines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oil producers claim that growth in sales of all-electric cars will not substantially reduce world demand for oil. The world needs oil for much more than just cars. Cars account for only about a fifth of the 95 million barrels the world consumes every day. Most of the rest is used in industry or to fuel heavy goods vehicles, aircraft and ships, which do not have easy non-oil alternatives. In developing economies, petrol sales are expected to continue rising because these countries do not have the infrastructure or sufficient capital investment to enable the switch to electric vehicles.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2016 only 20 % of world demand for oil was for use as a fuel for cars. Demand for the other 80 % of uses do not have easy non-oil alternatives. Demand is, thus, relatively price inelastic. [2]</li>
<li>Demand for oil in emerging economies is also expected to continue to rise. They also do not have the resources to change the infrastructure to install charging points. Their demand for oil is also relatively price inelastic. [2]</li>

<li>Petrol and diesel engines emissions linked to negative externalities due to causing pollution of the atmosphere and health problems especially for those living in urban areas:MSC &gt; MPC [1]</li>
<li>Electric car use will lower external costs through eliminating carbon pollution [1] but there may still be as many cars so problems of traffic congestion, especially in urban areas, will continue to get worse as demand for cars increases. [1]</li>
<li>Other transport – ships, planes, heavy goods vehicles – will still depend on oil and will probably increase as demand increases. External costs are likely to rise. [1]</li>

<p>In 2018, real output in China's economy grew by 6.6%, its lowest figure this century (see Fig. 1.1). Many economists believe that growth in China's real output will continue to be around this level over the next few years.</p>
<p>In looking to the future, the Chinese government has sought to restructure its economy. This has resulted in an increased contribution from domestic consumption, with less reliance on large-scale manufacturing in favour of quality manufacturing. For Chinese consumers, buying a house is the main priority, followed by purchasing a new car. Table 1.1 shows the annual rate of change in new car sales from 2010 to 2017.</p>
<p>China's plans for maintaining its growth in real output at a rate of around 6.6% are threatened by ongoing tensions over trade with the United States (US). These tensions provide a real threat to China meeting even its most pessimistic growth targets for real output. Various studies have estimated the effects of a protectionist trade war with the US on China's economy. These estimates are all negative and range from –0.6% to –1.4% of real output.</p>

<p>India's income has grown at its slowest rate in almost five years, according to the latest data released by the government. In the past financial year - April 2018 to March 2019 - income grew by 6.8%. And in the quarter between January and March 2019, it expanded by just 5.8% - falling behind the rate of China's growth for the first time in nearly two years. This means India is no longer the world's fastest-growing economy. The new data make it clear that India is facing an economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Unlike China, India's growth in income has been driven by domestic consumption over the past 15 years. But data released over the past few months suggest that consumer spending is slowing, despite the continuing growth in incomes. Motorbike and scooter sales are down. Demand for bank loans has slowed and India's leading maker of fast-moving consumer goods, such as packaged food and drink, has reported slower revenue growth in the past quarter. However, sales of smartphones have continued to increase faster than incomes have been growing. All of these are important indicators for measuring the state of consumption spending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government has promised that it would cut income tax to ensure greater purchasing power and some economists believe that the government should also consider cutting business taxes in the next budget, which will be announced in July 2019. These measures should act as a stimulus for the economy.</p>
<p>India's government has promised to spend US$1.44 trillion to build roads and other infrastructure such as bridges and street lighting, but India's large budget deficit might restrict the government's options. Many observers say that this money will have to come from the private sector. Experts say that the widening fiscal deficit will hold back medium-term and long-term growth.</p>
<p>Weak exports have also been a problem when it comes to creating jobs. In response the government is expected to prioritise policies that will make Indian businesses more competitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The consequences of hyperinflation are far-reaching. Inflation undermines the functions of money. Rapid price rises encourage panic-buying by consumers, creating shortages that further increase inflation. In the most extreme cases countries stop using money completely, and resort to barter. In Zimbabwe, hyperinflation led to the abandonment of its currency in 2008 and the use of the US dollar as an alternative. More recently, Venezuelan restaurants and supermarkets stopped displaying prices and consumers only found out the value of their purchases at the checkout.</p>
<p>To avoid the consequences of high inflation, central banks often set a low 'target' rate of inflation, typically around 2% a year. But this policy has also been criticised by some people. If central banks follow such a target the outcome would be to erode the real value of money over time. Central banks have often been instructed by governments to have an inflation target, and yet even a 2% inflation rate will halve the real value of money in 36 years.</p>
<p>Central banks can use high interest rates as a tool of monetary policy to keep down the rate of inflation, but very often monetary policy requires low interest rates to stimulate consumption spending and investment in an economy.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that there are potential benefits of relatively low levels of inflation and this is why some countries have an inflation target of, say, 2%. A former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund even suggested that many countries' inflation target should be 4% rather than 2%.</p>

<p>Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.</p>
<p>In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.</p>
<p>Recent competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry has aimed at improving fuel efficiency, developing longer non-stop flying ranges and developing very large aircraft with a capacity of 500 passengers. The companies have been successful in achieving the first two aims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third aim of developing very large aircraft was intended to move larger numbers of passengers between 'hub' airports, where they would transfer to smaller aircraft for onwards transport to regional airports. Whilst it has achieved increased passenger capacity, this development has not been a success for the airlines that bought these very large aircraft. The need for these was undermined by the success of the first two competitive developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry is that it involves significant fixed costs. The research and development (R&amp;D) costs of a new aircraft can rise to US$26 billion.</p>
<p>Currently the two companies are concerned that China, in its drive to increase the value of its exports, will enter the aircraft manufacturing industry in the next 10 to 15 years and add a new level of competition.</p>

<p>A government usually has macroeconomic policy aims that it hopes will enable some success in raising the quality of life, or well-being, of the population. In doing this the government also hopes to achieve efficiency in the use of resources.</p>
<p>Efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs. Inputs are relatively easy to count: they are financial costs of public services. Output can also be counted, but it is not necessarily a good measure of the outcome. The outcome is much harder to calculate. It is broader and more subjective – how do we assess whether a public service is 'better' or 'worse'?</p>
<p>This is where a knowledge of well-being makes an enormous difference. It could provide a much clearer view of the trade-offs that have to be made in allocating taxpayers' money to public services. Take the example of healthcare. To maximise the impact of expenditure on well-being, the budget may need to be adjusted to give more to mental health services and less to building general hospitals. For older people it could mean giving priority to programmes that would keep them out of hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A focus on well-being should lead to better outcomes. This is where policymakers need a better understanding of behavioural economics. Governments have established Behavioural Insights teams, or Nudge Units. They have had some success. A small change in the wording of a letter to people who owed tax demonstrated how more behaviourally sensitive language sped up payments. The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.</p>
<p>Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.</p>

<p>Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.</p>

<p>It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.</p>
<p>Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.</p>

<p>Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.</p>
<p>Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.</p>
<p>Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.</p>
<p>Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.</p>
<p>The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.</p>
<p>Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.</p>

<p>The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.</p>
<p>A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.<br>The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.</p>
<p>According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.</p>

<p><em>Candidates may adopt alternative approaches to this question. One </em><em>approach may use a circular income flow model and use this to explain the </em><em>concept of equilibrium.

<p><em>Evaluative comment should be provided to discuss the potential success of </em><em>these measures. For example, subsidies might involve a significant </em><em>opportunity cost, training and education often requires a long time period to </em><em>produce success. </em></p>

<p><strong>'Smoking cigarettes causes negative externalities and negative </strong><strong>externalities cause market failure which can only be solved by </strong><strong>government intervention.’ </strong></p>
<p><strong>To what extent do you agree with this statement? </strong></p>
<p><em>There are three parts to this question. Answers should provide a clear </em><em>explanation of the meaning of a negative externality and the link between </em><em>the definition and asymmetric information and negative spill-over effects. </em></p>
<p><em>Analysis should be then used to explain why negative externalities cause </em><em>market failure. In this case market failure would be identified as an </em><em>allocatively inefficient use of resources. Further analysis of the link between </em><em>government intervention and the solution to this type of market failure </em><em>should be provided. </em></p>
<p><em>Alternative solutions to this type of market failure should be considered and </em><em>a conclusion provided which examines whether government intervention is </em><em>the only possible solution to this type of market failure. </em></p>
<p><strong>L4 (18–25 marks):</strong> For a reasoned and clear discussion which links each of the three separate parts of the question. Analysis of the links will be combined with some evaluative comment relating to the effectiveness of government intervention. A reasoned conclusion should be provided.21 max no conclusion.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>L3 (14–17 marks):</strong> For a competent comment together with limited elaboration of the analysis or imprecise links in the argument. There will be some discussion but the evaluation will not be fully developed or extensive.</p>
<p><strong>L2 (10–13 marks):</strong> For a brief explanation but weak or ill-explained links.The explanation will be undeveloped with some attempt at analysis but the emphasis will be on descriptive comment or not all of the three elements of the question will be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>L1 (1–9 marks):</strong> For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Consumer spending in the US fell by 0.8% in November 2008 and by a further 1% in December. December 2008 was the sixth consecutive month in which consumers cut back on their spending. Between October and December 2008 spending fell by a record 8.9%. Consumers were in a mood to increase their savings but not to go out and spend. Generally, that’s a good thing, but not when everyone does it at the same time. By January 2009, the savings rate in the US had reached the highest it had been for 14 years. This increase in savings was caused by low consumer confidence and the fear of higher unemployment.<br>Declining consumer spending is a particularly troubling sign for the US economy, because spending accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP. GDP fell by 3.9% between October and December 2008, the sharpest decline in 26 years.<br>This decline in spending resulted in<br>&nbsp;– a proposed $888 billion stimulus plan from the government, including about $278 billion in tax cuts,<br>&nbsp;– companies reducing their workforce to cut costs because of falling revenue,<br>&nbsp;– the expectation that business investment, which accounts for about one-tenth of US GDP, would decline during 2009.</p>

<li>Spending increased in Jan and Feb which would indicate an improvement; – this might be linked to the fact that price changes were no longer negative; income was also up in Jan, but fell in Feb; So some improvement. [3]</li>
<li>There is no apparent consistency between income and spending either in direction or amount. Even if spending is considered in the subsequent month to the income change there is no consistency. There is more consistency between the overall price change and spending in the direction of the change in the same month, but not in the extent of the change. Up to 3 for either comparison. [5]</li>
<li>A fall in spending will cause a fall in demand, expected revenue/profits to business will decline. If the decline is significant or if it is protracted and it is thought that the trend will continue then there will be less revenue with which to invest and no incentive to invest. [4]</li>
<li>A rise in saving could mean more funds available to lend which will stimulate the economy. However, if everyone saves more we know from the multiplier that this means reduced injections into the economy as people spend less. We are told that spending accounts for two-thirds of GNP. Increased saving and low spending affects businesses, it could cause more unemployment. It also affects the government which would probably have to spend more supporting the unemployed and also receive less in tax revenue. The data says that US government is proposing to reduce taxes but this will come at a cost later either in a switch of government expenditure – so some anticipated projects will not be funded – or in subsequently raised taxes which will not be welcome.<br>Up to 6 for comment on positive side, up to 6 for comment on negative side – max 8 but multiplier should be mentioned on one side of the argument.

<li><strong>Explain, using a normal demand curve, how consumer surplus occurs. [8]</strong><br><em>A normal demand curve slopes downward from left to right and shows a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. Consumer surplus is the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay for a good and what he actually pays for it. It arises because of the downward sloping nature of the demand curve and the fact that the price paid is that for the last worthwhile purchase. The consumer might be willing to pay $10 for one item of a product but the market price is $2, this gives consumer surplus of $8, for the second he might value it at $7 so consumer surplus is $5 and so on until the surplus disappears. Consumer surplus is zero when the market price matches the buyer’s valuation. The more elastic the demand curve, the lower the level of consumer surplus. Price changes will directly affect the level of consumer surplus.</em><br>Understanding of consumer surplus and demand curve&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Explanation of varying levels of consumer surplus&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks</li>
<li><strong>With the help of diagrams, discuss whether consumers will benefit from the introduction on a product of (i) an indirect tax and (ii) an effective maximum price. [12]</strong><br><em>An indirect tax is a tax on consumption. An effective maximum price sets the highest price at which a good can be sold and is below the market price. An indirect tax shifts the supply curve to the left and raises the price. This reduces the amount of consumer surplus with less consumed and surplus per item reduced. The consumer pays a higher price and consumes less of the product. This does not benefit the consumer although the way the tax is spent may be to their advantage and a tax on a demerit good may raise their welfare. An effective maximum price is set below the market price and results in a smaller quantity supplied, greater quantity demanded and excess demand. Unofficial black markets may develop. The reduced consumption will reduce the consumer surplus as less is consumed, while the lower price will increase consumer surplus for those who continue to consume. Some consumers will benefit while others will lose. Whether the overall effect is an increase or decrease will depend on the level of the maximum price and the elasticities of demand and supply. The maximum price has the potential to raise consumer surplus, an indirect tax does not.</em><br>Understanding and diagram of an indirect tax and effective maximum price&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Discussion of tax impact&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Discussion of maximum price impact&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>With the help of a diagram, explain why some goods are produced in quantities greater than is socially desirable. [8]</strong><br>Overproduction is usually associated with production of goods with negative externalities and demerit goods. Negative externalities, such as pollution, impose a cost on third parties which is not reflected in the market outcome where the price is too low and quantity too great. Demerit goods, such as cigarettes, are demanded in quantities which reflect the consumers’ lack of information about the effects of consumption or the failure to act upon that information. As the free market sets an equilibrium that only accounts for the private costs and not the external and therefore social costs the socially desirable outcome will not be achieved.<br>Understanding of externalities and demerit goods&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Explanation with diagram showing overproduction&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks</li>
<li><strong>Discuss whether national defence or a public park is the better example of a public good. [12]</strong><br><em>A public good possesses the properties of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Consumption by one does not reduce the availability to others and it is not possible to restrict the benefit of the good to selected groups. Non-rejectability, that is automatically having to consume the good or service, can also apply. Defence is a classic example of a public good, as increases in population do not reduce the protection for current consumers and it is not possible to prevent consumers in some places from getting the benefit as it applies nationally. Everyone is automatically protected. A public park is non-rival up to the (unlikely) point at which its popularity causes it to become so crowded that others cannot enjoy it and the admission of others would reduce the consumption of other users . While public parks are usually free to enter, so no-one is excluded by price, it is possible to exclude people by admission systems and the enforcement of charges. No-one is forced to enjoy the existence of the public park as they are not compelled to use it.

Certain other goods will not be supplied in sufficient quantities or not at all if left to the market. Public goods, such as defence, are non-excludable and non-rival so it is not possible to charge for them and ‘free riders’ can gain benefit without paying. In this case the government provides the good or service and pays for it out of general taxation. Another case is merit goods. These provide a greater benefit than is recognised by the consumer and so will be under-consumed from society’s viewpoint. Health and education fall into this category. The government will provide the goods or services from taxation and offer them at a subsidised or at no price. In both cases the government is making the judgement that providing these will raise welfare levels in society.

<p>New discoveries about the link between diet and health have led to increased demand for higher-quality foods. Government policies on labelling also influence how the markets for food develop. Labelling increases consumers’ knowledge, which affects their purchasing patterns. Food producers have responded to these changes by drawing attention to the health aspects of their products.<br>On the demand side of the market, consumers choose food in order to obtain utility, part of which comes from their belief in the value of food to maintain or improve their health. The healthier the food, the more benefit to the consumer. However, as with demand in general, consumers will reduce the amount they are willing to pay for each additional unit of a food.<br>On the supply side of the market, producers provide higher-quality food if it is profitable to do so or if they are required to do so. Often, to increase quality needs extra research, which is costly. In general the marginal cost of providing an increase in food quality is likely to be represented by an upward-sloping curve. Producers may cover these extra costs by product differentiation.<br>All this assumes that both buyers and sellers are fully informed about the nature of the product and that market price reflects all the costs borne and benefits enjoyed by society. However, it should be remembered that<br>&nbsp;• sellers are better informed about quality than consumers,<br>&nbsp;• consumers may have misunderstandings about the risks of different foods and<br>&nbsp;• information about food quality may have the characteristics of a public good.</p>

<p>In some countries supermarkets dominate food shopping. In the UK 75% of the food bought for home use comes from supermarkets. A third of that comes from one supermarket, Tesco. Tesco makes billions of pounds profit, one third of which goes to the government in taxes. It employs 110 000 people in the UK and many more in developing countries.<br>In the past, UK shoppers queued to buy expensive food from many small shops with limited choice and restricted opening times. Now, in supermarkets, they have the benefit of a wide choice, reasonable prices, international dishes, organic produce, fair trade items, clear labels of the contents of the products and, because of intense competition between the supermarkets, some open 24 hours.<br>However, the media complain that supermarkets are not competitive but monopolies. They say their profits are too high, they have caused small shops to close and forced suppliers in developing countries to accept low prices and to pay low wages.<br>It must be remembered that supermarkets grew because they gave the customer what they wanted and aimed at certain types of shoppers. One supermarket, which started as a small shop, insisted on selling only high quality products while another offered customers low prices.<br>Supermarkets also adapted to changing market trends. One began to supply products with its own brand name which were sold more cheaply because there were no advertising costs. A further brilliant idea in expanding their business was the introduction of a store loyalty card. Shoppers with a loyalty card are given discounts which encourages them to continue to shop in the same supermarket.<br>The most successful supermarkets expanded their businesses by buying large sites to build huge stores. (They are criticised for such building, especially if it destroys parts of the countryside or environment.) They expanded into non-food products to fill these stores, making it possible for consumers to buy many household items from clothes to kitchen utensils to electrical goods in the same shop. Supermarkets have also recently introduced on-line shopping and home deliveries.<br>Many small shops have closed. There are bound to be casualties in retailing. How can the blame for that be the fault of the supermarket? Their size should not be a concern. It is, after all, the consumer who decides where to shop and what to buy.</p>

Whether a deficit is a serious matter and indicates weakness depends upon its size (minimal or excessive), its continuity (how long has it run? is it continuous?), the cause of the deficit (buying consumer or investment goods?), its affordability (level of reserves, ease of borrowing), the effect it is having on the economy (running up debt, need for restrictive policies) and the nature of the deficit (which part of the account is causing the problem?), whether the deficit is structural or cyclical.<br>Depending which of these conditions apply, it may or may not indicate a weak economy.

Demand pull may be caused by expansionary government policies and consumer incomes and attitudes to spending. Cost push may occur because of trade unions achieving wage rises in excess of productivity gains, tax rises, raw material costs and the actions of monopoly suppliers.

<li><strong>Explain why it is important to have an accurate measure of inflation. [8]</strong><br>Inflation is a sustained rise in the general price level. Inflation statistics form the basis of government policy, affect firms’ and individuals’ planning and are used to set index linked wages, welfare benefits and interest rates. They are a means by which the success of current policy can be judged and are of interest to citizens, investors, trade unions, and official bodies. Inflation is a central economic target. If the statistics are inaccurate the direction and level of action may be inappropriate and may worsen the position. Lack of trust of the statistics may undermine the acceptance of policies and their effectiveness. Errors may be made in planning and real values may not be maintained.<br>Understanding of inflation and recognition of the uses of a measure&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Explanation of the need for accuracy/problems of inaccuracy&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks</li>
<li><strong>Discuss the methods and problems involved in constructing an accurate measure of the rate of inflation. [12]</strong><br>Inflation is measured by a weighted price index. This may be the consumer price index, the retail price index or a variation of these. Each of the stages of construction has problems. Choosing the base year needs a year with ‘normal’ conditions. The selection of a basket of goods needs to reflect average consumption patterns and allow for the introduction of new products. Weighting the individual contents has to reflect up to date spending patterns. Sampling sales outlets must cover a wide enough range of types and locations. Even if these are achieved the average picture may not accurately reflect the position of groups e.g. pensioners; it may not reflect changes in quality of goods; it may lag behind events and it may be based on inaccurate statistics and invalid sampling.

[8]</strong><br>Elasticity of demand concerns the responsiveness of demand to a change in a variable. An inferior good is one that is bought in smaller quantities as income rises, as it is replaced by a superior good. It involves income elasticity which has a negative value. An example might be motor cycles replaced by cars.<br>Complementary goods are ones that are jointly demanded, such as coffee and cream.

<li><strong>Discuss the importance of price in the effective operation of a mixed economy. [12]</strong><br>The mixed economy combines market and planned features. Prices are set by the operation of demand and supply and by government action. Price is central to the private sector where it acts to ration out goods and allocate resources. It does this efficiently by using the profit motive to create incentive. This should result in choice and low cost for consumers. However price does not always work well. Goods with externalities will be sold at the wrong price and in the wrong quantities, as are merit and demerit goods. There are also public goods which do not attract a price and will not be provided. Prices may fluctuate excessively or be at an undesirable level. This requires government intervention to help consumers and producers. The effect of price is more important in the private sector but does not necessarily work efficiently overall.<br>Understanding of the mixed economy and price&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Discussion of the efficient role of price&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks<br>Discussion of the failings of price&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 marks&nbsp;</li>

<p>The Central Bank of Swaziland’s report on the 2007 export performance identified the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exports grew by 8.4% with a positive performance by some manufacturing companies.</li>
<li>Successful exports included sugar, sugar-based products, soft drink concentrates, wood pulp and timber products, textiles and garments, citrus and canned fruits and meat products.</li>
<li>Global demand and rising export prices led to increased export revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Export performance was helped by the depreciation of the domestic currency against the US$ and the currencies of other trading partners outside of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and Common Monetary Area (CMA), of which Swaziland is a member. In addition, exports of meat and meat products to the European Union (EU) resumed in 2007 after the EU lifted its ban on Swaziland’s beef exports. This ban was originally imposed because of Swaziland’s failure to comply with the required quality standards.</p>

<p>Adam Smith's proposition that free markets organise economic resources for the benefit of everyone rests upon the even distribution of power between the market participants. Without that even distribution, the proposition fails.</p>
<p>The reality of markets today is that the distribution of power is uneven and the markets are exploited by the powerful for their own gain. Markets are imperfect.</p>
<p>These imperfections hinder economic equality. Economic equality is linked to economic power and requires ownership and control over economic resources. Concentration of economic power,particularly in the hands of large global companies can adversely affect local economies. For example, local business owners have to work longer hours to compete with giant corporations.<br><br>The growth in the power of large companies is a cause of inequality in the distribution of income&nbsp; and wealth. The companies have an ability to make high profits, to practise price discrimination&nbsp; and exploit consumers. This sometimes leads to regulation by governments. Consumer protection&nbsp; is usually the aim. Take-overs are monitored. Progressive taxes on high incomes are used. Social&nbsp; welfare, inheritance taxes and greater workers' rights all attempt to deal with excessive inequality.<br><br>However, it is also said that large companies contribute disproportionately more to a country's&nbsp; economic growth than smaller ones. Such companies are more productive, pay higher wages,&nbsp; enjoy higher profits and are more successful in international markets.<br><br>Therefore, differences in economic growth between countries, it is argued, could be linked to the difference in the number of large firms.<br><br>In Spain and Italy, firms are on average 40% smaller than those in Germany. Increasing the size of firms in Spain and Italy, it is said, is the key to improving their comparative economic growth.<br><br></p>
<p>Firms with more than 250 employees are only 5% of manufacturing firms in Spain and Italy. This compares with a much higher 11% of firms in Germany. The average firm size in Spain is 49.3 employees, and in Italy it is 42.7 employees. Both are lower than the average of 76.4 employees per firm in Germany.</p>

<p>During the recession of 2009 several economists forecast that some emerging (fast developing) economies would perform better than the developed economies. One indicator of this, they said, was the strength of the exchange rate of the currency of some emerging economies against the US dollar. For example, between November 2008 and July 2009, the Brazilian currency rose 11.4% against the dollar and the Indonesian currency rose 10.2%. Another indicator was the forecast growth rate in GDP as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p><br>Emerging economies are often dependent on exports to achieve an increase in GDP. Some economists suggested that it would be better for their economic growth if these countries were to concentrate on domestic demand rather than exports.<br>China, in particular, they said could lead the world out of the recession if it relied increasingly on domestic demand. Indeed, the Chinese government encouraged a shift from export-led industries to programmes aimed at improving the Chinese infrastructure in order to create jobs and thus increase consumption of Chinese goods. Banks were encouraged to make borrowing easier in order to create more credit for consumers and businesses. The government started a massive fiscal stimulus and increased its forecast of GDP to a growth rate of 8.3% in 2009 and 10.9% for 2010 (previous forecast figures were 6.0% and 7.0% as in Table 1).<br>However, other economists do not accept that there should be an emphasis on domestic demand. They argue that trading links are the strongest evidence of the emerging economies’ ability to grow. They state ‘no emerging market that adopted an export-led growth model has subsequently needed to break away from it – including China’. China’s exports as a percentage of GDP are 32% compared with only 13% for the US. Smaller Asian countries are even more dependent on exports; Singapore’s ratio of exports to GDP is 234%, Hong Kong’s is 169%. It will be difficult for economies such as these to increase domestic demand and reduce their dependence on export-led growth.<br><em>(Source: Financial Times: June 12 2009.

<p>In 2009, there was an economic recession in many countries. One aspect of the recession was that unemployment rose. Governments paid large subsidies to a number of industries to try to stop the rise in unemployment. This increased the governments’ debt and affected its other expenditure.<br>In an attempt to recover part of the extra expenditure, some governments had a policy of increased income tax rates on people who had high salaries.<br>However, critics of this policy argue that higher tax rates do not work. They say that the proportion of revenue received from top taxpayers falls and does not rise as taxes increase and the higher taxes cause damaging effects on the economy. It is better they say to decrease taxes. The decrease in taxes brings the government more revenue, not less revenue. Their opinion is supported by evidence from the past as is seen in the effect on tax receipts of changing tax rates in the US as shown in Fig. 1.<br><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/cfe35148cf4111eb850400163e02ecea-1623916713.png" alt="" width="603" height="249"><br>It is suggested that this opposite policy of reducing tax rates is better. Lower tax rates actually boost both the economy and tax revenues. For example, Russia, Latvia and Estonia reduced their highest tax rate and replaced a complicated system of taxes with a single income tax rate of 10%. They enjoyed a huge economic boost as a result.<br>Another aspect of the recession was that businesses found it difficult to borrow money from the commercial banks. In order to try and make borrowing easier and help businesses, some central banks lowered their interest rates. The central banks also bought government bonds in an attempt to increase the supply of money in the economy.</p>

Subsidies will lower prices for consumers and help make domestic farmers competitive with foreign producers so helping the balance of trade. They will enable farmers to stay in business with effects on employment and the environment. The benefit will be split between the consumer and farmer depending upon the elasticities involved.

It might be argued that the products are demerit goods because of the harm to hearing and disturbance to others. An indirect tax is imposed on spending and raises the price of the good. PED measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in price and affects the impact of an increase in an indirect tax. A tax will best reduce the quantity imported when demand for imports is elastic as there will be a<br>more than proportionate fall in demand. To raise revenue it is better for demand to be inelastic so that the fall in demand is less than proportionate to the price rise.

<p>The Northern Territory of Australia is a large, sparsely populated area. It relies heavily on tourism, mining, agriculture and fishing. The extraction of oil and gas and the mining of iron ore and bauxite have grown significantly in recent years. Its manufacturing is principally based on the processing of its natural resources.<br>The Northern Territory government publishes forecasts, which compare the economic prospects of the Northern Territory with those of Australia as a whole.

Deflation refers to a persistent fall in the general price level or a lower level of economic activity possibly resulting from government policy.

<li><strong>Discuss whether inflation can be both the cause and the result of fluctuations in an economy’s exchange rate.

<p>Some people have become concerned about the amount of poisonous gases and carbon emissions being produced. They say it will lead to a change in climate which will have an economic effect.<br>When buying products, consumers sometimes ask ‘what country has it come from?’ They are concerned about the long-term economic effects of the exploitation of resources. Some argue that carbon emissions caused by transport should be reduced. They think people should buy local products, even though they may be more expensive, and not buy those which have been sent long distances.<br>The situation is not as straightforward as they suggest. Research by one university shows, for example, that carbon emissions produced by growing flowers in the powerful Kenyan sun and flying them to the UK can be less than one-fifth of the carbon emissions from producing and transporting flowers from Holland. Holland is much nearer to the UK, but uses greenhouses that need to be lit and heated.<br>Transport does have an environmental and social cost but most of that cost comes from domestic road travel. Air-freight to the UK from Africa accounts for less than 0.1% of UK carbon emissions, and the £1m a day that UK shoppers spend on food from Africa is vital to ease the poverty of millions of Africans.<br>It is said that the world’s poorest people in developing countries, least responsible for climate change, are most under threat. In Bangladesh, excess rains and floods mean that farmers can no longer grow their crops. One family said that for the past seven years crops failed because of the floods and they could not buy clothes or food, or pay for education.<br>In many African countries small farms are the largest private sector activity. They provide jobs and enable growth of rural businesses. Agriculture accounts for about 30% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in sub-Saharan Africa, at least 40% of its exports and up to 80% of employment. Agricultural production is subject to unpredictable weather, which creates economic uncertainty. A more stable farm economy could overcome that uncertainty by creating jobs and associated small-scale manufacturing such as food processing.<br>An African farmer said ‘the idea of supporting African farming has been forgotten in favour of reducing the carbon emissions of the developed world by abandoning the trade with developing countries on which local people have come to depend. It is made worse by the fact that the local people do not eat the crops that are grown for export, so the food cannot be sold locally.’</p>

<li>Explanation of any suitable characteristics, for example, employment distribution, health, education, standards of living, sanitation, dependence on overseas aid. [4]</li>
<li>They are concerned about the total cost of production including the externality of carbon emissions. They argue that resources should be conserved and not exploited. This, they say, could be achieved by switching to local products. [2]</li>
<li>There should be a statement about the meaning of marginal utility (1); the relation of marginal utility to price (2); and a comment about buying more expensive products (3). The theory does not prevent the purchase of more expensive items. Fewer would be bought if the price were higher. It might be questioned whether buying <strong>the same</strong> product at a higher price was rational and whether the argument was reasonable. [6]</li>
<li>Developing countries depend on agriculture – some figures are given for some countries. Agriculture depends more on the weather than other sectors. Incomes are more volatile. An example is given. Developing countries have come to depend on trade with developed countries which is likely to be withdrawn. Developed countries are rich enough to go to other suppliers; developing countries would find it difficult to find other buyers. It is likely that the statement is true but there is only a little supporting evidence and some general background information. [8]</li>

<p>By the start of 2009, Japan’s economy had suffered its worse contraction for over 50 years. The world’s second-largest economy saw a fall of 15.2% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2008 and 2009. Japan’s economy is dependent on exports, which fell by a record 26% in the last quarter of 2008, forcing companies to cut production as they had much spare capacity. Business investment declined by 10.4% during 2008. Weaker domestic consumer demand was also a cause in the fall of GDP in 2008 but this declined by only 1.1%, much less than business investment demand. However, by March 2009 industrial production started to increase and there were hopes that the economy would start to grow again.<br>In the UK, between 2008 and 2009, GDP fell by 5.7%. It was thought that it would take some time to reverse the recession. Export orders continued to decline sharply and this, an industry leader said, ‘is a particular concern as we are not seeing much of a boom in exports from the weakness of sterling’. Also, manufacturers had cut costs, reduced the number of people employed and experienced reduced profits. However, they still had excess stocks and it was not thought likely that investment would increase quickly. Consumer spending declined as consumers were unsure of the future. With rising unemployment, likely tax increases and a lack of credit facilities from the banks, the decrease in spending was hardly surprising. The inability of consumers to obtain credit caused a decline in house building, which had further negative effects on employment in the construction industry.<br><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/cc6055eece7311eb850400163e02ecea-1623828231.png" alt="" width="640" height="260"></p>

Japan’s GDP fluctuated more than UK’s between 2005–2009; Japan’s GDP fell to a lower level than the UK at the end of 2008. In some ways there was a similar pattern of decline but with Japan’s decline of 15.2% worse than the UK’s of 5.7%. [4]</li>
<li>The concern is because exports generate income and employment and the economy partly depends on exports. When sterling is weak exports should be cheaper and demand should be higher. Demand was low when the prices of exports were comparatively low. It would be expected that low prices would have increased exports. Up to 4 marks only without mention of elasiticities. [5]</li>
<li>Both economies suffered from a fall in consumer spending, a fall in business investment, a fall in exports, an increase in unemployment, excess capacity in businesses. (Up to 5 marks for an indication of the influences with little direct comparison). The difference in the information was the emphasis given to exports in Japan and the emphasis given to the housing market in the UK. [8]&nbsp;</li>

<p>In 2009 a recession occurred in America and Europe where unemployment rose. As well as seeing their incomes fall as employers cut wages and jobs, households also saw the value of their homes and savings shrink dramatically. This led to a swift reaction from consumers who reduced spending and increased savings, and planned to live within their income.<br>The change in consumer spending habits, as shown in Fig. 1, in both America and the European countries in the Euro area, caught retailers and manufacturers by surprise. In response companies tried to increase revenues by using advertising and sales promotions, often without success.</p>

<p>There was a trend towards buying environmentally-friendly products and healthy foods although consumers became less willing to buy them at the higher prices at which they were normally sold. Producers launched lower-priced products to avoid losing customers.<br>Interestingly, while sales of luxuries such as long-haul holidays declined, consumers looked for something less expensive to make them feel good. Purchases of cosmetic items, such as skincare products and fragrances, increased in the recession. Paying by cash, instead of by credit card, gained popularity. 80% of consumers surveyed said they preferred to pay by cash rather than by credit card.<br>Consumers also began to place more trust in recommendations, searching for information on products in reviews on websites, rather than buying by brand name alone. The recession has made consumers more likely to demand value for money.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Explain the significance of a rise in the terms of trade for a country. [8]</strong><br>The terms of trade relate the price of exports to the price of imports. They are measured by the price of exports/price of imports and expressed as an index. A rise may result if export prices rise relative to import prices.

Government may influence trade by trade protection policies, industrial support and by intervening in the exchange rate. The government involvement in transfers may mean receipt of aid, international contributions and grants. Income is more likely to link to the private sector. Other causes of surplus are based on private activity in efficient production and innovation. Income is likely to be from previous private overseas investment and loans and transfers can result from private remittances.

<p>The nature of the trade in potatoes has also changed as the growth of trade in processed products, such as frozen and dehydrated potatoes, has overtaken trade in fresh potatoes. Processed potatoes are used by fast food, snack and convenience food industries and sell at higher prices than fresh potatoes.<br>Tariffs, food health standards and technical regulations are used by some countries to protect domestic potato markets. Potatoes provide a good example of ‘tariff escalation’, where a country imposes higher tariffs on processed products than it does on raw materials. For example the average world tariff on fresh potatoes was 29%, while that on some processed potato products ranged from 38% to 109%.&nbsp;</p>

It may lead to the provision of non-essential services e.g. cosmetic surgery. Healthcare is a merit good (imperfect information) and generates positive information.

<p>Between January 2002 and July 2008 the world price of rice, a staple food for many people in developing countries, rose by slightly over 300%. As shown in Fig. 1 the price of rice changed<br>very significantly in the six months to July 2008 and was influenced by the actions of different governments.</p>

<p>The rise in the price of rice was typical of a wide range of commodities. These price rises caused food and fuel riots in developing countries. As a result some governments turned to protectionist trade measures. Vietnam limited rice exports while Cambodia and Egypt banned all rice exports.<br>The Indian Government replaced the minimum export price that it enforced for non-basmati rice with a complete ban on rice exports. At the same time it placed restrictions on wheat imports for the purpose of disease control.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In 2011 many countries experienced a recession. Most industries, even monopolies, in those countries saw a decline in demand, consumer spending and profits. However the decline was less severe in some firms, for example those in the food and beverage industry, than for others, for example those in the leisure industry. This fall in consumer spending and in consumer confidence might have been caused by anticipated job losses as governments announced reductions in public sector expenditure.<br>Governments decided to reduce expenditure because they had very large budget deficits. Apart from public sector employment reductions the macroeconomic measures they introduced included fewer subsidies, tax increases and a more restrictive monetary policy.Tax increases did not help businesses. For example they made it more necessary for firms to make the control of any credit they gave a priority, and to monitor their cash flow very carefully.Increasing prices to match indirect tax increases in order to retain profit levels was not always possible when consumer demand was reduced. The alternative of reducing costs was also a problem. Some argued that firms operating with a high proportion of fixed costs found the market conditions increasingly difficult as their revenues failed to recover and the possibility for further cost reductions became more limited. Others thought that firms with a higher proportion of variable costs faced greater difficulties.<br>Some governments also reduced investment allowances and subsidies to firms. These tax-free allowances enabled firms to deduct some of the investment cost from what they had to pay in tax.However, a reduction in the allowances had no effect on those industries that did not invest in new equipment. It did harm small and medium-sized enterprises that wanted to buy new machinery, or undertake research in order to become more efficient, or improve their products.<br>The situation was not helped by increased restrictions imposed by the government on banks’ability to lend. These restrictions meant borrowing for house purchases was more difficult and this again reduced consumer expenditure.<br><em>&nbsp;(adapted from The Guardian)</em></p>

<li><strong>Use the information to explain how macroeconomic changes can be linked to </strong><strong>microeconomic decisions. [5]</strong><br>5 marks for effects. Those mentioned in the text of how public sector decisions have an impact on private sector firms include – reduced investment, lower profits, reduced demand,not possible to raise prices, public sector employment reduced causing a decline in confidence, fear of job losses, and possible reductions in expenditure, reduced research etc.</li>
<li><strong>Analyse with the aid of a diagram, showing costs and revenue for a monopoly, what is </strong><strong>likely to happen to the firm’s profits when there is a fall in demand in the industry due </strong><strong>to a recession [5]</strong><br>Average revenue (ar) shifts back, marginal revenue (mr) shifts back, output declines to a new marginal cost (mc)/mr point, price falls. It is likely that profits will fall, although this might be a reduction in supernormal profit rather than a loss. Diagram: 1 for labels, 1 for shift of one curve (normally the ar one), 1 for correct change in output. 2 for explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest, using the concept of income elasticity of demand, why the decline in profits was less severe during the recession in the food industry than in the leisure industry.&nbsp;[4]</strong><br>It is likely that the food industry deals in more essential products, with lower income elasticity,possibly, and less effect on sales and revenue. This might explain the differences in changes in profit although it is uncertain how the relative costs in leisure and food were affected.</li>
<li><strong>Do you support the opinion in the information that a recession is likely to be worse for </strong><strong>firms with a high proportion of fixed costs than firms with a higher proportion of </strong><strong>variable costs? [6]</strong><br>Explanation of differences between fixed and variable costs. Possibly the situation may be worse if the fixed costs form a high proportion of the costs and cannot be covered nor, in the short run, avoided. (Theory assumes fixed costs paid for before production and only need to cover variable costs. Practice probably is that fixed costs are paid monthly. But either way still have to pay for fixed costs) However, it depends on the level of profits. Firms with lower fixed costs may still be affected badly if the profit levels were not high. Reserve one mark for a conclusion.&nbsp;</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">In 2011, two soap and detergent firms, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, were fined a total of €315 m (US$ 220 m) for fixing the price of washing powder in eight European countries. Procter &amp;Gamble is the world’s largest consumer products company. The two firms had colluded over prices<br>for more than three years. The collusion began when they agreed to implement an industry-wide programme to improve the environmental impact of their products. They agreed to reduce the amount of packaging they used but to keep the prices unchanged. Then, later, they collectively agreed to raise prices in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. This collusion was against the European Union competition laws and was regarded as ‘unfair competition’.<br>Some information from the 2010 Annual Report of Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G) is shown in Table 1.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Explain what is meant by collusion and when it is most likely to occur in an industry.&nbsp;[4]</strong><br>It is an agreement between firms; maybe to fix prices, maybe to fix output by quotas, maybe both. It could be an agreement on restricting advertising. It is most likely to occur when there is a small number of firms, where it is easy to monitor, where products are similar. Two marks for definition; two marks for occurrence.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyse, using Table 1, whether price fixing benefited Procter and Gamble. [4]</strong><br>&nbsp;Profits in 2010 were down compared with 2009, but they rose between 2006 and 2009. The dividend rose throughout the period. Revenue fluctuated but the overall trend was up – there is no information about prices – only about overall earnings which may be partly the result of<br>cost changes. One mark for comment on each; one mark for development of any part.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suggest why creating the advantage of large scale by ‘integrating across its different businesses’ might benefit a firm. [6]</strong><br>&nbsp;Candidates could consider the advantages of integration, benefits of ordering, supply chain,administration, economies of scale, specialisation, use of resources, cost savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the evidence in the article sufficient to conclude that Procter and Gamble is working against the public interest? [6]<br></strong>Comment on information – Profits were down in the last year but may have been down more if there had been no collusion. This may be regarded as against the public interest. However there is no information about cost saving, or about rivals’ prices/profits/costs. In favour of the public interest it might be said that P&amp;G does research, gets top place in a stated list for its innovations – whether the list is of value is uncertain. Packaging was reduced avoiding waste; its brand names are popular with the public. A large firm may increase employment.<br>Up to four marks for one side.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In 2011 many countries experienced a recession. Most industries, even monopolies, in those countries saw a decline in demand, consumer spending and profits. However the decline was less severe in some firms, for example those in the food and beverage industry, than for others, for<br>example those in the leisure industry. This fall in consumer spending and in consumer confidence might have been caused by anticipated job losses as governments announced reductions in public sector expenditure.<br>Governments decided to reduce expenditure because they had very large budget deficits. Apart from public sector employment reductions the macroeconomic measures they introduced included fewer subsidies, tax increases and a more restrictive monetary policy.<br>Tax increases did not help businesses. For example they made it more necessary for firms to make the control of any credit they gave a priority, and to monitor their cash flow very carefully.Increasing prices to match indirect tax increases in order to retain profit levels was not always possible when consumer demand was reduced. The alternative of reducing costs was also a problem. Some argued that firms operating with a high proportion of fixed costs found the market conditions increasingly difficult as their revenues failed to recover and the possibility for further<br>cost reductions became more limited. Others thought that firms with a higher proportion of variable costs faced greater difficulties.<br>Some governments also reduced investment allowances and subsidies to firms. These tax-free allowances enabled firms to deduct some of the investment cost from what they had to pay in tax.However, a reduction in the allowances had no effect on those industries that did not invest in new equipment. It did harm small and medium-sized enterprises that wanted to buy new machinery, or undertake research in order to become more efficient, or improve their products.<br>The situation was not helped by increased restrictions imposed by the government on banks’ability to lend. These restrictions meant borrowing for house purchases was more difficult and this again reduced consumer expenditure.<br>&nbsp;<em>(adapted from The Guardian)</em></p>

<li><strong>Use the information to explain how macroeconomic changes can be linked to </strong><strong>microeconomic decisions. [5]</strong><br>5 marks for effects. Those mentioned in the text of how public sector decisions have an impact on private sector firms include – reduced investment, lower profits, reduced demand, not possible to raise prices, public sector employment reduced causing a decline in confidence, fear of job losses, and possible reductions in expenditure, reduced research etc.</li>
<li><strong>Analyse with the aid of a diagram, showing costs and revenue for a monopoly, what is </strong><strong>likely to happen to the firm’s profits when there is a fall in demand in the industry due </strong><strong>to a recession [5]</strong><br>Average revenue (ar) shifts back, marginal revenue (mr) shifts back, output declines to a new marginal cost (mc)/mr point, price falls. It is likely that profits will fall, although this might be a reduction in supernormal profit rather than a loss. Diagram: 1 for labels, 1 for shift of one curve (normally the ar one), 1 for correct change in output. 2 for explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest, using the concept of income elasticity of demand, why the decline in profits was less severe during the recession in the food industry than in the leisure industry.&nbsp;[4]</strong><br>It is likely that the food industry deals in more essential products, with lower income elasticity,possibly, and less effect on sales and revenue. This might explain the differences in changes in profit although it is uncertain how the relative costs in leisure and food were affected.</li>
<li><strong>Do you support the opinion in the information that a recession is likely to be worse for firms with a high proportion of fixed costs than firms with a higher proportion of variable costs? [6]</strong><br>Explanation of differences between fixed and variable costs. Possibly the situation may be worse if the fixed costs form a high proportion of the costs and cannot be covered nor, in the short run, avoided. (Theory assumes fixed costs paid for before production and only need to cover variable costs. Practice probably is that fixed costs are paid monthly. But either way still have to pay for fixed costs) However, it depends on the level of profits. Firms with lower fixed costs may still be affected badly if the profit levels were not high. Reserve one mark for a conclusion.&nbsp;</li>

<p><br>SMEs are recognised as an important source of economic growth and their development has been given priority by the government. 72% of government development programmes, worth US$178 million, were provided for SMEs in 2008. A further US$156 million was provided in 2009.<br>With these funds, the government has introduced several programmes for SMEs including the provision of loans, technical advice and information on prices, production and technology. Government programmes also help producers identify the products markets require and understand changes in consumer tastes. The aim of the programmes is to encourage a better performance from SMEs.<br>Initially, Malaysia protected local enterprises. However, realising the huge potential that foreign investment could bring, government policy has changed and now encourages programmes that welcome more direct foreign investment.</p>

The larger enterprises account for only 10.7% of the number of enterprises in manufacturing but produce, disproportionately, 65.1% of the manufacturing output.The largest % of SMEs by sector is in agriculture but agriculture accounts for only a small % of the output of the economy.<br>In services, SMEs account for 96.7% of the total number of enterprises but the remaining 3.3% of larger enterprises produce 43.4% of the output.(SMEs produce 56.6%).<br>The output and export value puts a different perspective on the importance of SMEs compared with the number of enterprises existing.

<li><strong>The economic growth rates are shown to be negative. Explain what economic theory suggests might happen to the level of unemployment in an economy if the growth rate figure is negative.

Candidates could explain briefly how the changes in income and employment occur. (4)</li>
<li><strong>What evidence is there from the information whether there is any link between the economic growth rates and unemployment? [3]</strong><br>There is unemployment with negative growth but larger negative growth doesn’t necessarily mean larger unemployment. For example, Italy’s negative growth is higher than Greece, Portugal and Spain but its unemployment rate is lower than that in all three countries. We do not know what the growth and unemployment rates were in the previous year so cannot really conclude how the change in growth affected unemployment in the year shown. (3)&nbsp;</li>

The information does not support the concern. However with a relatively smaller negative growth it still has a government debt of 124% of GDP which is the highest of the countries shown. This is why there was so much concern and the information does support that worry. (4)</li>
<li><strong>Discuss the possible effects on economic growth and unemployment of the policies suggested by the Spanish Government. [6]</strong><br>Spain proposed (i) raising the retirement age, (ii) reducing public spending (iii) increasing taxes and (iv) increasing measurers to stop tax evasion<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Raising retirement age increases labour supply. Changes in the labour supply have an uncertain effect on growth. Increased labour supply might result in lower average wages. Spending may then not change overall, or, if the increased labour is employed at the lower ends of the pay scales, spending may go up as lower wage earners spend a higher proportion of income. Increased spending may increase growth. Or alternatively the increase in labour supply may increase unemployment and this will not increase growth.</li>
<li>Reducing public spending may have the effect of reducing incomes and reducing spending which affects growth.</li>
<li>Increased taxes may reduce investment and reduce growth, may increase unemployment which is already high.</li>
<li>Increasing measures to stop tax evasion might increase government revenue and allow additional government spending (6)</li>

<p><strong>How does aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis explain the existence of inflation in the short-run? [8]</strong></p>
<p>Aggregate demand is total spending in an economy and it is shown as a curve sloping downward to the right. Aggregate supply is the total amount of output at a given level of prices in the economy and is shown as a curve sloping upward to the right. This may be shown in a diagram. Their interaction sets the equilibrium level of price and real output in the economy. Inflation can be caused by an increase in AD, from increases in its components (C+I+G+(X-M)), or a reduction in AS from influences such as wage rises or more expensive raw materials.</p>
<p>• For knowledge and understanding of AD and AS.<br>4 marks<br>• For application to show how changes in AD and AS can result in inflation.<br>4 marks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discuss whether a period of inflation or a period of deflation is more economically desirable. [12]</strong></p>
<p>Inflation is a sustained rise in the general price level. Deflation is a sustained fall in the general price level or a reduction in aggregate economic activity. Inflation has effects on international competitiveness, shoe leather and menu costs, the distribution of income, the ability to plan and the level of confidence. Deflation is linked to rising unemployment, falling economic growth, lower living standards, changing international competitiveness, changing distribution of income (differently to inflation) and loss of confidence. There is some overlap between the effects, and the effects may depend upon the rate of change. Mild inflation is often thought to be desirable. Governments may favour inflation as it reduces the real value of debt and increases income through higher tax revenue. The desirability will depend on the standpoint adopted.</p>

<p><strong>Explain how income elasticity of demand and cross elasticity of demand can be used to classify different types of good. [8]</strong><br>Income elasticity can relate to inferior good where there is a reduction in demand as consumer income rises e.g. bus travel. This would have a negative income elasticity of demand (YED) as Y rises QD falls. Cross elasticity of demand can relate to complementary goods that is consumed in conjunction with another product e.g. bread and butter. There will be a negative cross elasticity of demand (XED) as a rise in the price of one good causes a fall in the demand for the complement. It can also identify substitute or alternative goods e.g. Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola where cross elasticity will be positive. Candidates may offer the formulas.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discuss the effectiveness of government use of maximum and minimum prices to help consumers and producers. [12]</strong></p>
<p>A maximum/minimum price intends to keep prices below/above the market level. The former would benefit consumers, the latter producers. Maximum prices will be ignored and ineffective if set above the market price and minimum will not work if below the market price. A maximum price will benefit those consumers who manage to buy the good but will create a shortage at the set price. This will require government intervention to allocate the restricted supply among the would-be consumers but may result in illegal, black markets that favour the richer consumer. A minimum price will cause an excess supply that will require government action such as storage or destruction with its associated costs. It will favour the producer at the expense of the consumer and taxpayer. Both policies conflict with the market outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Explain whether the factors of production are always of equal importance within and between economies. [8]</strong><br>Factors of production are land, labour, capital and enterprise. While all are likely to be needed to some degree their relative importance differs within and between economies. Advanced economies may rely more on capital with more emphasis on enterprise, developing economies may focus on land and labour. An economy relying on manufacturing will have a different pattern from those relying on agriculture and services. The nature and productivity of the factors will also differ between economies. They are unlikely to be of equal importance either within or between countries.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Discuss whether planned economies should always be replaced by free market economies. [12]</strong><br>A free market economy is based on demand and supply and private activities. A planned economy is based on state ownership and control. Market economies have performed more successfully in terms of living standards. This is attributed to greater efficiency based on consumer sovereignty, incentive and flexibility. Against this can be set greater instability, more unequal distribution of income, higher likelihood of unemployment and the failure of the market to operate effectively. Some of the latter are avoided by the planned economy. The change in eastern European economies supports the preference for the market outcome although it depends upon individual priorities.</p>

Producers in other economies might also benefit from lower component costs.

<p><strong>Use economic analysis to explain the benefits of international trade. [8]</strong><br>The benefits are based on comparative advantage. It exists when one economy can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another. This is based on different factor endowments. Specialisation and trade at a rate between the two opportunity costs will increase output and raise living standards. The model is based on assumptions including two products, two countries, no transport costs, constant returns to scale and mobility of labour. The benefit can be shown by a numerical example.

[12]</strong><br>Restrictions on trade include tariffs, quotas, subsidies, voluntary export restraints (VERS) and exchange controls. They are intended to raise the price or restrict the quantity of imports and to lower the price of exports. The case against restrictions is that they prevent the benefits of free trade, lower living standards, reduce choice, lower employment and may provoke retaliation. There are some short-term arguments that are considered justifiable. These include arguments for protecting infant industries, preventing dumping, slowing the decline of sunset industries, improving the terms of trade, and raising revenue.

<li><strong>Explain, using elasticity of demand, the possible reasons why in some countries there has been an increased use of private transport instead of public transport. [8]</strong><br>The pattern is a move from public to private, such as buses to cars.

<li><strong>Discuss the economic reasons for subsidising public transport and taxing private transport. [12]</strong><br>The arguments relate to externalities. Public transport may generate positive externalities by reducing congestion and pollution. A subsidy would lower price and increase output, helping to establish a market equilibrium that took social cost and benefit into account. Private transport may generate negative externalities and a tax would raise price and reduce<br>consumption to a level more in line with the economically desirable output. A combination of the two policies should help tackle the problems that arise when a market operates in line with private cost and benefit rather than social cost and benefit.

[8]</strong><br>Money is anything that is generally acceptable as a means of payment and has four functions. The production possibility curve (ppc) shows the maximum possible combinations of outputs when an economy operates at full employment. The loss of confidence will prevent money being acceptable and its functions will not operate effectively. This will restrict specialisation and output.

<li><strong>Discuss the difficulties involved in changing a planned economy to a successful market economy. [12]</strong><br>A planned economy relies on state control and direction while a market economy involves private activity and operation of demand and supply. To make a successful transfer, markets need to exist, as does the profit motive, competition, incentives, private property, free trade, decentralised activity, limited state intervention, the tolerance of economic failure and support for business casualties. The ease of introducing these varies, some can be done in a short time at low cost e.g. the sale of state assets, while others may take a long time and have limited success e.g. changing attitudes to risk. A range of other difficulties may be considered e.g. provision of public goods, merit/demerit goods, externalities, inequality etc. Some may result in a ‘soft landing’, others a ‘hard landing’.

<p>Many central banks use ‘inflation targeting’. Their principal aim is to achieve a particular annual rate of inflation within an acceptable range. For example, they might aim for a 2% rate of inflation but will accept a rate between 1% and 3%. Some economists claim that inflation targeting will help reduce the actual rate of inflation. The Central Bank of Turkey uses this approach and Table 1 shows how well it has worked.<br><strong>&nbsp;Table 1: Inflation in Turkey 2003–2008 (annual % rate)</strong></p>

<p>There has been a rapid growth in companies that sell ‘virtual goods’ on the Internet. The goods do not exist, they are only pictures on a screen used to play computer games. One game for example puts the consumer in the position of a farmer. Items for the farm, such as farm animals, crops and farm buildings, can be purchased. However, the farm buildings and the crops and animals are not real. They are only computer graphics on the consumer’s home computer.<br>One firm has spent US$10m in the last ten years promoting these games. Its director said ‘In the last two years we have seen the revenue of firms in this industry go from nothing to tens and hundreds of millions of dollars.’<br>The director of another firm said ‘We have two different revenue sources. The first is the sale of the virtual goods for the games, the second is the revenue from other firms who wish to advertise within the game.’<br>Some items are acquired by consumers because they accumulate points by completing an activity within the game, such as harvesting a crop. Other items can be purchased to speed up the game. Part of the motive, said one consumer who spends about US$10 a month on virtual goods, is to impress your friends and let them see all the virtual goods you have won or bought. It has now become a popular thing to do. Central to the increased popularity of the games is the fact that the virtual goods can be purchased through social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace.<br><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/0da875f4bf8811eba60f00163e02ecea-1622187663.png" alt="" width="450" height="202"><br>Proof of the attraction of this market is the fact that the social networking sites are negotiating with the virtual goods firms to get a percentage of the revenue every time a consumer purchases a virtual tractor or crop.<br>The promoters of the virtual goods say it enables consumers to buy products without the rush and crowds of shops. They are easy to buy and that is why people are prepared to buy products that do not exist.<br>The firms claim that tens of millions of people buy the virtual products. In December 2009 one of the firms sold part of its business to another firm for US$113 million, whilst another was valued at US$400 million.<br>The director of one virtual goods firm said ‘the industry is one of the most exciting developments of 2009, it is in the early stages of growth but it is growing fast.’</p>

They may suggest that capital of $10m is large, revenue large, employment small, market share unknown, value of companies $113m and $400m large. However they may give reasons to suggest that some of these figures represent smaller firms in the communications industry. There should be an overall judgment. [4]&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recent financial crisis has slowed down economic growth worldwide but the number of migrants seeking work in another country is still increasing. One reason for this is that the countries from which workers leave may have experienced a severe recession making workers willing to travel abroad to do unpopular jobs that others avoid. A further reason is that many migrants move to join other members of their family which helps explain why migration, once established, is hard to reverse.<br>Workers going abroad are particularly important for the Philippines, where 25% of the labour force work overseas. Doctors go abroad to work as nurses; teachers go to work as housemaids. In addition, local centres train workers to enable overseas work. For example, workers train to clean cabins on cruise ships in the hope that they will be able to earn four times the local wage for cleaning. The workers send money home (migrant remittances) to support their families. This money can provide food, clothing, housing, pay for educational expenses or for investment in small enterprises.<br>Migrant remittances could become even more important to a country because experts predict that aid and foreign direct investment in developing countries could be halved as a result of the 2009–2010 financial crisis.<br>There is a debate about the use of migrant labour. For employers, there is an advantage in employing cheap foreign labour in order to reduce costs. However, the consequence of using foreign labour is that domestic workers are being replaced. There is also little or no incentive for manufacturers to mechanise their production processes because it is cheaper to use labour than invest in capital-intensive machinery.<br>The flow of money from migrant workers has been rising by as much as 33% each year in some areas, but the rate of growth is beginning to slow down. In 2007, the World Bank predicted that, by 2009, the amount sent home by the world’s 150 million international migrants could fall by about 1%. Mexico, the third biggest recipient of migrant remittances in the world, estimated in 2007 it would receive $23.8bn but that this would fall in 2008 by almost 8%.<br>In 2010, a different organisation produced the following table of migrant remittances.<br><strong>Table 1: Money sent home by migrant workers to selected countries (US$ billion)</strong></p>

<p><strong>What might be concluded about the Philippines economy from the information given?&nbsp;[4]</strong><br>Large dependency on foreign income, – low wages – possible high unemployment – might be in recession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How far is the information in the fifth paragraph of the article supported by the evidence in Table 1? [4]</strong></p>
<p>Not supported: – Mexico forecasts in 2007 were not good<br>– Mexico’s prediction for 2008 was incorrect&nbsp;<br>– In most areas the increase has not been around 33%<br>– The World Bank’s prediction of a slowing in growth of income sent home in 2008/9 was incorrect from the figures given but there are only selected countries and their figure was an overall average<br>Supported: – Mexico is the third largest recipient of the countries given<br>Overall conclusion: text and data do not really agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess whether it is beneficial for the receiving country to use migrant labour. [5]</strong><br>It might be beneficial because the labour is cheaper, but foreign labour may replace local labour which may cause problems and cheap labour may not encourage innovation and investment. In addition it may not be beneficial if money is returned to home country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discuss the overall effect of the outflow of workers on the economy of their home country. [7]</strong><br>It is uncertain. It depends on what happens to the money earned and on whether the loss of labour is significant, or whether the loss of labour can be replaced by capital. Production may be reduced as workers go abroad; alternatively production may go up as money sent home is used for investment or because the income spent causes increases in demand. Other factors to consider are possible social changes, whether the cost of training is met at home or by the host country, short run versus long run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recent world recession has resulted in an increased government budget deficit in many European countries. Fig. 1 shows budget deficits and economic growth rates for 2010 together with expected economic growth for 2011 for selected countries.&nbsp;<br><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/bb22d0eabf8211ebab5000163e02ecea-1622185377.png" alt="" width="493" height="454"><br>Below are two opinions about budget deficits.</p>
<p><strong>First opinion</strong><br>Budget deficits should be reduced quickly by immediate reductions in public spending. An economy needs to grow and reductions in public spending encourage growth in the private sector. If the economy grows, wages will rise. Consumers feel safe to borrow and consume more. Investors will expect better returns if growth increases and they will also know that the deficit has been reduced by cuts in public spending and not by tax increases.</p>
<p><strong>Second opinion</strong><br>In 2009 there was a massive reduction in demand by the private sector in some countries. To<br>offset the reduction in private spending, some governments believed they should increase public spending. This would cause a larger budget deficit and provide a stimulus to demand. Businesses need increased demand to invest and innovate. Increased demand causes a multiplier effect on national income. Demand is central to the debate about budget deficits.<br>Below is a newspaper comment on these two opinions.<br>By 2010 the falling value of some countries’ currencies stimulated international demand for their tradable goods, resulting in manufacturing growth. Some argued that this growth in exports meant it was possible for the government to decrease its spending to reduce the budget deficit.<br>Others argued that this growth in exports would be insufficient and raised the question ‘where would demand for the economy’s output then come from?’ They said it would not come from the public sector because the decrease in government spending would put people out of work, ruin small businesses and damage some larger ones. It would not come from the private sector because interest rates on borrowing in some countries had been at record low levels for some time but this had failed to stimulate demand. They believe it is better to wait until an economy grows and repay the deficit by reducing public spending gradually. (Source: The Observer 13/06/10)</p>

They are vital in the production of glass, petrol, flat-screen televisions, laptops, lasers, satellites, energysaving light bulbs, jet engines and wind turbines. As many as eight REEs are used in an electric car and military hardware depends on them. World demand for REEs is expected to continue to increase.<br>There are problems with mining these minerals. They are found in many countries but are not concentrated enough to make it easy to exploit them economically. In the 1980s and 1990s China invested heavily in machinery and training labour for mining REEs. The entry of China into REEs mining pushed prices down to a level that forced many rivals in the United States out of production.Most countries rely totally on imports for their supplies of REEs.<br>Mining them produces undesirable side-effects, such as radioactivity, air pollution and spoilt landscapes. Mining also uses highly toxic chemicals that can pollute the water supply. China, as shown in Fig. 1, is now the dominant global supplier. It also has the largest reserves.<br><img src="./AL Econ MS only_files/03d097eebee511eb954600163e02ecea-1622117638.png" alt=""><br>Source: Kaiser Research Online<br>China imposes export taxes on REEs of up to 25% and sets export quotas that were reduced in August 2010 from 28 417 metric tonnes to 7 976 metric tonnes per annum.</p>

<li><strong>Describe China’s changing contribution to the global production of REEs between 1950 and 2012. [3]</strong><br>&nbsp;Prior to the mid-1980s China was not a supplier (1). Growth to become dominant supplier(1), elaboration (1), e.g. by the mid-1990s China had overtaken rest of the world production,by 2012 China will out produce the rest of the world more than twofold. China’s share increased 1985–2007 (1) but fell 2008–12 (1).</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li><strong>Explain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> possible reasons why demand for REEs is likely to continue to grow.[3]</strong><br>&nbsp;Their extensive use means that economic growth and higher living standards are liable to raise the level of worldwide demand (2). Their use in high technology products means more demand as technology is more widely applied in high income elastic goods (2).The move to conservation and greener technologies will boost demand in energy saving and generation (2). Price has fallen, so demand likely to grow (2).</li>
<li><strong>Analyse the social costs associated with the increased mining of REEs. [4]</strong><br>&nbsp;Social costs are made up of private and external costs (1), private costs are incurred by the producer while external costs (negative externalities) affect 3rd parties (1), private costs of mining include e.g. labour costs (wages and training) and costs of equipment (purchase and running) (1), external costs include e.g. pollution and environment degradation with worsening health and living conditions. Alternative examples are acceptable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>What might be the economic justifications for China’s reduction in export quotas for </strong><strong>REEs? [3]</strong><br>&nbsp;It might argue the need<br>• to preserve a diminishing resource<br>• to supply its own industries<br>• to protect the environment<br>• to ensure security of supply<br>• to improve the terms of trade<br>• increase export earnings if PED inelastic (rising prices of X = 1)<br>• increase costs of foreign competitors of products using REEs/reduce competitiveness<br>• part of a general policy to reduce B of P surplus/depreciate currency</li>
<li><strong>Discuss whether it is likely that China will be able to maintain its domination of the </strong><strong>international REEs market in a time of rising global prices for REES. [6]</strong><br>&nbsp;China is currently dominant because of a lack of competitors; it has production advantages(such as low labour costs, investment) and market power. This may be short-lived if higher prices attract competitors, REEs can be sourced from countries other than China, the technology is known to former US producers, the prospect of higher prices/profit may encourage former producers or new entrants into the market and fear of dependence on China may encourage government intervention. A market response makes it unlikely that China will be as dominant in the long run as both economic and financial influences promote additional producers. Credit a reasoned conclusion.&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>One explanation of the world sugar price rise was the weather. 2009 proved particularly unfavourable in major producing countries, with drought in India, too much rain in Brazil and hailstorms in Russia. Another explanation offered was motorists’ increased use of ethanol as a car fuel. One way to produce ethanol is by using sugar cane as a raw material. Sugar prices in individual economies changed in a variety of ways. In 2008 sugar prices in India fell partly because the Indian Government banned sugar exports. In response to this price fall, Indian farmers planted less sugar cane. Malaysia was affected by rising sugar prices but mainly as a consumer. The Malaysian Government set a maximum price of 1.45 ringgit per kilogram. Tesco hypermarkets in Malaysia reacted to this price by rationing customers to 2 kilograms per customer. On the black market in Malaysia sugar was sold at 1.70 ringgit per kilogram, while it fetched 2.90 ringgit in neighbouring Thailand.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Increased supply of sugar as a result of the export ban has reduced prices of sugar in India.<br>This will help Indian consumers, especially the lower income groups. India's current account will be affected as sugar exports fall. Sugar farmers will reduce cultivation of sugar and this is likely to increase prices in the future. It may also lead to unemployment.

<li><strong>Explain the different types of international economic integration. [8]</strong><br>The common forms of integration are free trade areas, customs unions, and economic unions.

<li><strong>Discuss the possible economic effects of a global ban on all forms of trade protection.&nbsp;[12]</strong><br>Trade protection involves measures to restrict the flow of international trade, such as tariffs, quotas, subsidies and exchange controls. The outcome is that the domestic market faces less international competition. A ban on protection would mean free trade with greater international competition. This has the benefit of more efficient production based on comparative advantage, cheaper prices, wider choice, higher employment and greater welfare. The change might cause casualties in the short run that might justify temporary protection. The usual cases involve infant industries, sunset industries, structural adjustment, loss of government revenue and harm to the terms of trade.

<li><strong>Explain, with the use of an aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) diagram, the different effect of cost-push and demand-pull inflation on real output. [8]</strong><br>Inflation is a persistent rise in the general price level. Cost-push is based on rising costs such as wages, raw materials, taxes and affects the AS curve. Demand-pull results when consumption, investment, government spending or exports minus imports shift the AD curve.<br>A shift to the right of the aggregate demand curve on an upward-sloping section of the aggregate supply curve will cause inflation and Increase real output. A shift to the left of the aggregate supply curve will also cause inflation but will reduce real output.<br>For <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> of cost-push inflation, demand-pull inflation and real output (Max. of 2 for anyone) (4)<br>For an <strong>analysis</strong> of the effects on real output. (4)</li>
<li><strong>Discuss whether the effect of the rate of inflation on the exchange rate is more or less important than the effect of the exchange rate on the rate of inflation. [12]</strong><br>A relatively high rate of inflation will make a country less competitive in international trade. Exports may fall, imports may rise and the current balance may worsen. International confidence in the currency may fall reducing investment and the financial flow may become adverse. There will be less demand for and increased supply of the currency and it may depreciate. A low rate of inflation may not have a noticeable effect.<br>Changes in the exchange rate affect the rate of inflation within an economy. A depreciating exchange rate will make imports more expensive (cost-push inflation) and exports cheaper (demand pull inflation). An appreciation will reduce inflationary pressure. Candidates may consider the extent to which each influence is the major or only influence on the other. For example inflation may be influenced by a wide range of domestic factors while the exchange rate may be significantly affected by the trade position. A decision on the importance of the two links will depend on the conditions assumed.<br>For <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> of the rate of inflation (1) and the exchange rate (1) (2)<br>For an <strong>analysis</strong> of how the rate of inflation can affect the exchange rate (4 max.) and how the exchange rate can affect the rate of inflation (4 max.)

<p>There are two parts to the question: whether the market is controlled by the producer and not the consumer, and whether utility theory is valid. The balance between producer and consumer sovereignty may vary between goods and markets but the producer is not the only determinant of market price and output.

<p>In 2011, there were big increases in oil prices which led to comparisons with a period in the 1970s when oil prices also rose steeply. In the 1970s, the macroeconomic policy used in the UK was to increase budget deficits. By contrast, in 2011, the macroeconomic policy was to try to reduce the budget deficit.<br>In the 1970s some thought the effect of oil price increases would be inflationary while others thought the effect would be deflationary. The following points were made.<br>In the 1970s<br>&nbsp;• consumers would have to spend more on oil but they would spend less on other things.<br>&nbsp;• consumers would not spend their savings.<br>&nbsp;• firms could pass on the increased cost of production, caused by higher oil prices, to consumers.<br>&nbsp;• oil prices were an important item used in the construction of the consumer price index.<br>&nbsp;• oil producers and suppliers would not necessarily spend their increased revenues.<br>Table 1 below shows the rate of inflation in the UK in the 1970s.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In 2011, oil prices increased again. The question then was whether the outcome would be the same as in the 1970s. Again some said there would be deflationary effects, while others predicted inflationary effects. In addition to the points that were made about the 1970s price increase, these further points connected with the economic context of 2011 were considered.<br>In 2011<br>&nbsp;• oil prices rose by 50% compared with 240% in the early 1970s.<br>&nbsp;• consumers faced potential unemployment in the private sector from low growth rates as economies tried to recover from a world banking crisis and recession.<br>&nbsp;• consumer spending on oil as a percentage of GDP was about 40% lower than its 1970s level.<br>&nbsp;• economies were less dependent on oil than in the 1970s.<br>&nbsp;• workers in the public sector were worried about possible unemployment as the public sector was reduced in size.<br>&nbsp;• reduced government spending had a downward effect on employment in all sectors.</p>

<li>A fall in the general level of prices: candidates could explain it in terms of an excess of national income over expenditure, or withdrawals over injections at the full employment level of national income which causes a potential reduction in national income. [2]</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Candidates would need to refer to the table to comment upon the rate of inflation in the 1970s (1 mark). Candidates should also refer to the reactions of firms and the importance of oil in the construction of the price index (2 marks). Identifying one reason to dismiss the view that oil price rises might cause inflation (1 mark). [4]</li>
<li>Explanation of a budget deficit as an increase in expenditure over revenue. It could be achieved through fiscal or monetary policy. There could be a decrease in T, an increase in G, reduced i. This should encourage borrowing and spending. Extra demand could put pressure on resources which might result in rising prices. Table 1 shows rising prices. [6]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Less likely to be inflationary – smaller % oil price rise than in 1970s which was inflationary; – country less dependent on oil – oil to GDP now 60% of that in 1970s + government reductions in expenditure; also there was a smaller public sector; banking crisis – reduced employment in private sector (6 marks). Some reference to factors that would not support the view that oil prices in 2011 would be less inflationary (1 mark). A conclusion (1 mark). [8]&nbsp;</li>

<p>Unilever, a multinational global food manufacturer, with many branded products, has announced a partnership with Oxfam, the international relief agency, to help farmers in developing countries. Unilever welcomed the partnership and said that their objective was ‘to double the size of our business while halving our environmental impact. We want to do this by maximising the positive social impact of our business. A major element of this is to promote better livelihoods by incorporating 500 000 small farms in developing countries and small-scale distributors into our supply chain. This way we hope to have a positive impact on the lives of people living in poverty.’<br>Historically, companies in the food and drink industry have tried to improve efficiency and minimise costs by reducing the number of international suppliers they use. However, Oxfam said that firms are now starting to consider new ethical business models about how they source their produce. There is a need to move away from a short-term focus on profit margins and consider long-term objectives.<br>In 2011 a drugs company, GlaxoSmithKline, (GSK), manufactured a new medicine which had a higher market price than a rival medicine from another company. The medicine was expensive to research and produce. The expected annual revenue for the company from the sale of the medicine was estimated to be around US$314m; the annual cost of hospital treatment with the medicine for just one patient was around US$23 000. A government negotiated a new type of deal with GSK. The company agreed that it would supply public sector hospitals with the medicine at the same price as its rival’s product. It would also return some of the revenue it received from the hospitals if its product proved to be less successful than the rival product. The government said it was introducing a ‘value-based pricing model’. A spokesperson for GSK said ‘we are moving in the direction where price is determined by value and value is determined by evidence’.</p>

<li><strong>In what type of market structure is Unilever likely to be operating? Explain your answer. [3]</strong><br>It is a large multinational company so the size would indicate that it is in an imperfectly competitive market. This means it has some control over its price decisions, that it has branded products, which implies that it advertises. Allow 1 mark for market economy/mixed economy/diversified market provided there is an explanatory reason.</li>
<li><strong>Why might it be thought that there could be a conflict between Unilever’s stated objective and its policy concerning its suppliers? [5]</strong><br>It has an aim of doubling its size. This might indicate that it hopes to achieve economies of scale. However, elements of their business would seem to be towards perfect competition and against the idea of larger size as they wish to deal with 500 000 small farmers. It also had a policy of improving efficiency by reducing international suppliers. It says its future aim would be to halve our environmental impact. However, rather than limiting its transport and distribution to a few suppliers as it did in the past it is now expanding its distribution network with more demand on resources and transport pollution.</li>
<li><strong>GSK’s new drug was expensive to research and develop. Why might a company conduct research and development (R&amp;D) if it is so expensive? [4]</strong><br>It is presumed that the company wishes to make profits and to expand. It is hoped that the cost of research would help achieve this by creating a new product for which there is a large demand and that revenues from this product would more than offset the research costs.</li>
<li><strong>Discuss whether there is enough evidence in the information to conclude that the objective of Unilever and GSK is not that of profit maximisation. [8]</strong><br>There would still seem to be a desire for profit maximisation in the statements about doubling the size of the business (Unilever), and the wish to still make profit (GSK initial pricing). However, the article does not give information about the pricing of other products, and the comparative profits with other competitors are not known. Against the notion of a pure profit aim are the statements from Oxfam about Unilever and the government policy towards GSK’s supply policy. It may be, however, that this agreement with the government is more likely to secure a constant demand for GSK from government hospitals and would in the long run enable a more secure growth in profits. The overall conclusion is uncertain. Up to 4 for each company but reserve 1 for a stated conclusion to the question.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Some banks have been accused of having a control over the market that enabled them to get away with poor service, confusing products and dishonest claims about free banking. However, the banks maintained that their size created economies of scale, the benefits of which were passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. A report stated that the banks’ claim was not correct. Any benefits went mainly to shareholders and not to consumers. The banking industry, it said, had many of the characteristics of an oligopolistic market. The report said that charges for services were often difficult to determine and that obstacles which prevented customers switching accounts to rival banks meant that the banking industry was not competitive. (Source: The Independent)<br>Another industry dominated by a few large firms is food retailing. Morrisons is such a firm with 420 stores. It is the fourth biggest supermarket in the UK with a 12.3% market share in 2011 (its three main rivals had market shares of 30.3%, 16.9% and 16.5% based on the value of total sales). Unlike its bigger competitors, Morrisons owns many of the factories from which it gets its food. This vertical integration gives it an advantage over rivals. In addition, some of the products it sells are made in its supermarkets. It started to produce its own products in order to save costs. The stores have, for example, their own bakeries and butchers. The supermarket has plans to introduce home deliveries, on-line ordering and take-away meals. Its aim is to grow further. It recognises that it would take years to match the market share of its bigger rivals but it wants to be a ‘more dangerous’ competitor. <em>(Source: The Sunday Telegraph)</em></p>

<li>Comment on the meaning of the two terms: integration, vertical or horizontal, is a merger or acquisition, 2 marks. It may result in economies of scale which reduces long run average total cost but economies of scale can occur within an existing firm without a merger, 2 marks.&nbsp;[4]</li>
<li>Integration is likely to increase costs initially with a rise in both fixed and variable costs. Subsequently there may be savings and average costs may be reduced. Candidates could debate the relative increase in fixed and variable costs, and the relative long run reduction. [4]</li>
<li>Market share remained the same but two of its rivals’ market shares declined; revenue up by 4.4% which is higher than two of its rivals; only Sainsbury’s improvement was better than Morrisons. [4]</li>
<li>Oligopoly – few firms with the ability to prevent entry into the market. Banks: it is said there is a lack of competition, but this does not necessarily make them oligopolies. They may be able to prevent entry but the information does not comment on this. Supermarkets: there are 4 large supermarkets but many small firms, no evidence of prevention of entry; no evidence of collusion in either banks or supermarkets. Not enough evidence in the article to conclude existence of oligopoly. Up to 5 marks for either banks or supermarkets. [8]</li>

<p>Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have long cooperated on economic matters as members of the East African Community (EAC). In 2005 EAC became a customs union. EAC then became a common market in 2010 and planned to become a monetary union in 2012.<br>The EAC Customs Union operates a common external tariff (CET) with a number of rates. The tariff includes rates of 0% on raw materials, capital goods and ‘meritorious goods’ (for example medicines); 25% on consumer goods, and higher rates on selected ‘sensitive goods’ (for example 100% on cane sugar, 75% on rice and 60% on wheat).<br>Officials have identified a number of problems facing the EAC Customs Union. These include the continuation of non-tariff barriers, language barriers, illegal cross-border trade and limited staff resources. These are thought to be reducing the effectiveness of the EAC Customs Union.<br>Some details of Tanzania’s trade before and after the formation of the EAC Customs Union are given in Tables 1 and 2.<br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table 1: Tanzania’s trade with its EAC partners 2003 to 2008, US$ millions</strong></p>

<li><strong>Discuss the case for expanding the EAC after 2012 to include other neighbouring countries.

This may depend upon the economic structure and performance of the new members.&nbsp;(Up to 4 marks)<br><strong>The case against includes:</strong><br>Integration may be a difficult process which generates costs as well as benefits. Trade diversion may result. Some members might be casualties of the changes with reduced production and employment as the economic structure within the EAC changes.
