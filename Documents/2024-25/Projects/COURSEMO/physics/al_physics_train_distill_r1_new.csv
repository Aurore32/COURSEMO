0,Describe the Doppler effect. ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................................................[1],observed frequency is different to source frequency when the source moves relative to the observer B1 1,The Doppler effect occurs when there is a change in the observed frequency of a wave compared to the source frequency due to relative motion between the source and the observer.
1,"A car travels with a constant velocity along a straight road. The car horn with a frequency of 400Hz is sounded continuously. A stationary observer on the roadside hears the sound from the horn at a frequency of 360Hz. The speed of sound is 340ms-1. Determine the magnitude v, and the direction, of the velocity of the car relative to the observer.         v = .......................................................ms-1 direction ...............................................................  [3]",360 = (400 × 340)/(340 ± v) C1 3 v = 38 (37.8) m s-1 A1 away (from the observer) B1,"The observed frequency \( f' \) is lower than the source frequency, so the car is moving **away** from the observer.  
Using the Doppler effect equation for a receding source:  
\[
f' = \frac{f v_{\text{sound}}}{v_{\text{sound}} + v}
\]  
Substitute values:  
\[
360 = \frac{400 \times 340}{340 + v}
\]  
Solve for \( v \):  
\[
340 + v = \frac{400 \times 340}{360} \implies v = \frac{400 \times 340}{360} - 340 = 37.8 \, \text{ms}^{-1} \, \text{(away)}.
\]  

**Final Answer:**  
\( v = 37.8 \, \text{ms}^{-1} \), direction **away** from the observer.

\( 1640 = \frac{1600 \times 330}{330 - v_s} \).  
Rearranging:  
\( 330 - v_s = \frac{1600 \times 330}{1640} \approx 321.95 \).

   Using the diffraction grating equation \( d \sin \theta = n \lambda \), for the same order \( n \), a larger diffraction angle \( \theta \) corresponds to a longer wavelength.

2. **The greatest separation occurs in the second (or higher) order.**  
   Angular separation \( \Delta \theta \) between wavelengths increases with order \( n \). For a fixed \( \Delta \lambda \), the term \( n \Delta \lambda / (d \cos \theta) \) grows with \( n \).

Rearranging for \( F \):  
\( F = W - ma = 932 - (95 \times -15) \).

When the ball collides with the plate, it exerts a downward force on the plate. By Newton’s third law, the plate exerts an equal upward force on the ball. This causes the ball’s momentum to change direction (e.g., from downward **p** to upward **–p** after a perfectly elastic collision).

Path A is drawn as a smooth curve below the original path.

The vertical acceleration is also reduced, but the horizontal deceleration dominates, causing the ball to hit the ground sooner with a steeper angle (greater vertical-to-horizontal velocity ratio).

- \( l \): \( \text{m} \)

When the ultrasound pulse encounters a boundary between tissues (e.g., muscle and organ), a portion reflects as an echo. The transducer detects these echoes, and the time delay between emission and detection is used to calculate the depth of the boundary (since speed of sound in tissue is ~1540 m/s). The intensity of the reflected pulse depends on the difference in acoustic impedance between tissues, with larger differences (e.g., bone/fluid) producing stronger echoes. A computer processes the time delays and intensities to generate real-time 2D images, mapping the position and nature of internal structures.

The trolley starts at x = 0 with an initial velocity of 0.50 m/s, so the x-t graph begins with a non-zero gradient. As the trolley accelerates down the slope (due to a net force = mg sinθ − Fᴿ), its velocity increases uniformly.

1098,The Earth orbits the Sun in a circular orbit of radius 1.5 × 108 km. The mass of the Sun is 2.0 × 1030 kg. A distant star is found to have a planet that has a circular orbit about the star.

State and explain the effect on the potential difference across Z. ........................................................................... [2],resistance decreases hence current (in circuit) is greater p.d. across X and Y is greater hence p.d across Z decreases  or explanation in terms of potential divider:  RZ decreases so RZ /(RX + RY + RZ) is less  therefore p.d. across Z decreases M1 A1   (M1) (A1) [2],"When the temperature of thermistor Z increases, its resistance decreases. This reduces the total resistance of the circuit (as Z is in series with X and Y), causing the current in the circuit to increase. Since resistors X and Y have fixed resistances, the increased current leads to a greater potential difference (p.d.) across both X and Y. As the sum of p.d.s across X, Y, and Z must equal the supply voltage (12 V), the p.d. across Z **decreases** to compensate for the increased p.d. across X and Y. 

(Alternatively, using the potential divider principle: the p.d. across Z depends on the ratio \( \frac{R_Z}{R_X + R_Y + R_Z} \). When \( R_Z \) decreases, this ratio becomes smaller, reducing the p.d. across Z.)

[3],"nucleus/nuclei emits spontaneously/randomly α-particles, β-particles, γ-ray photons M1 A1 A1 [3]","Radioactive decay is the process in which an unstable atomic nucleus spontaneously emits particles or electromagnetic radiation to become more stable. This occurs randomly, meaning it is impossible to predict exactly when a specific nucleus will decay. The emitted radiation can be in the form of α-particles (helium nuclei), β-particles (electrons or positrons), or γ-ray photons (high-energy electromagnetic waves). For example, a nucleus might emit an α-particle to reduce its mass and charge, or emit a β-particle to adjust its neutron-to-proton ratio.

First, calculate the resistances of Y and Z using \( R = \frac{\rho L}{A} \).  

For Y:  
- Length = \( l \), diameter = \( d \) → radius = \( \frac{d}{2} \).  
- Cross-sectional area \( A_Y = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \).

The wavelength of the emitted radiation depends on the magnitude of the electrons’ acceleration during collisions. As different electrons undergo varying degrees of deceleration (e.g., some stop abruptly, others slow gradually), their accelerations differ, producing a range of photon energies. This distribution of accelerations results in a continuous spectrum of wavelengths, rather than discrete lines."
1322,A typical spectrum of the X-ray radiation produced by electron bombardment of a metal target is illustrated in Fig. 10.1.  (DIAGRAM)  Explain why   the spectrum has a sharp cut-off at short wavelengths. .................................................................. [3],either  when electron loses all its energy in one collision or  when energy of electron produces a single photon B1 [1],"The sharp cut-off at short wavelengths occurs because the shortest wavelength corresponds to the maximum energy of an X-ray photon. When high-speed electrons strike the metal target, they decelerate and convert their kinetic energy into photons. The maximum photon energy is achieved when an electron loses **all** its kinetic energy in a **single collision**, producing one photon. Since photon energy \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the maximum energy (determined by the electron’s kinetic energy \( eV \)) corresponds to the minimum wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{min}} \). This defines the abrupt cut-off, as no photon can have a wavelength shorter than this value.

Acoustic impedance is the product of the medium’s density and the speed of ultrasound in it (Z = ρc). 

If there is a large difference in Z between the two media, a greater proportion of the ultrasound intensity is reflected at the boundary. This reflection is detected and used to form images. If the Z values are similar, most of the ultrasound transmits through, resulting in minimal reflection. Thus, the contrast in images arises from varying Z values at tissue boundaries.

When these waves encounter a boundary between tissues with different acoustic impedances (e.g., muscle and organ), a portion of the wave is reflected back as an echo. The transducer detects these reflected echoes. The time delay between the emission of the pulse and the detection of the echo is measured, and since the speed of ultrasound in tissue is approximately constant (~1540 m/s), this time determines the depth of the boundary (depth = (speed × time)/2). The amplitude (strength) of the reflected echo depends on the difference in acoustic impedance between the tissues, providing information about the nature of the structures (e.g., fluid vs. solid). Multiple echoes from successive pulses are processed by a computer to construct a real-time cross-sectional image of the internal structures."

1435,"The output of an ideal transformer is connected to a bridge rectifier, as shown in Fig. 6.1.  (DIAGRAM)  The input to the transformer is 240 V r.m.s. and the maximum potential difference across the load resistor is 9.0 V.   Calculate the ratio         (DIAGRAM)   ratio = .................................................. [3]",VP = √2 × VRMS ratio = 240 √2 / 9    = 38 (VP = VRMS / √2 gives ratio = 18.9 and scores 1/3) (ratio = 240 / 9 = 26.7 scores 1/3) (ratio = 9 / (240 / √2) = 0.0265 is inverted ratio and scores 1/3)  C1 C1 A1     [3],"The primary voltage (r.m.s.) is 240 V. The bridge rectifier's maximum output (peak) is 9.0 V, which equals the secondary coil's peak voltage.  

Secondary r.m.s. voltage \( V_{\text{S(rms)}} = \frac{9.0}{\sqrt{2}} \, \text{V} \).  

Turns ratio \( \frac{N_{\text{p}}}{N_{\text{s}}} = \frac{V_{\text{P(rms)}}}{V_{\text{S(rms)}}} = \frac{240}{9.0 / \sqrt{2}} = \frac{240 \sqrt{2}}{9} \).  

Calculating: \( \frac{240 \times 1.414}{9} \approx 37.7 \), so ratio ≈ **38**.  

Final ratio = 240√2 / 9 ≈ 38.

1436,The variation with time t of the potential difference V across the load resistor in (b) is shown in Fig.6.2.  (DIAGRAM)  A capacitor is now connected in parallel with the load resistor to produce some smoothing.   Explain what is meant by smoothing. .................................................................... [1],e.g. (output) p.d. / voltage / current does not fall to zero e.g. range of (output) p.d. / voltage / current is reduced (any sensible answer) B1 [1],"Smoothing refers to reducing the fluctuations (ripple) in the output potential difference across the load resistor. When the capacitor is connected in parallel, it charges during peaks of the varying p.d. and discharges through the resistor during troughs. This maintains the p.d. at a higher average value, preventing it from falling to zero and decreasing the amplitude of the variations. The output becomes more stable/steady."

The smoothed curve starts at each original peak, then follows an exponential decay (RC discharge curve) towards the next peak. The peaks of the smoothed waveform align vertically with the original peaks. The troughs are raised compared to the original waveform, creating a rippled ""hill"" shape between peaks without reaching zero. The time between peaks matches the original waveform’s period.)
