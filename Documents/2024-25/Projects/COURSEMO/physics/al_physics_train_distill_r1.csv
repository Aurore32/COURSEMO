0,"A car travels with a constant velocity along a straight road. The car horn with a frequency of 400Hz is sounded continuously. A stationary observer on the roadside hears the sound from the horn at a frequency of 360Hz. The speed of sound is 340ms-1. Determine the magnitude v, and the direction, of the velocity of the car relative to the observer.         v = .......................................................ms-1 direction ...............................................................  [3]",360 = (400 × 340)/(340 ± v) C1 3 v = 38 (37.8) m s-1 A1 away (from the observer) B1,"v = 38 m s−1 direction away (from the observer)  
The observed frequency is lower than the source frequency, indicating the car is moving away. Using the Doppler effect formula for a receding source:  
\[ f' = \frac{f v}{v + v_s} \]  
Substituting \( f' = 360 \, \text{Hz} \), \( f = 400 \, \text{Hz} \), and \( v = 340 \, \text{ms}^{-1} \):  
\[ 360 = \frac{400 \times 340}{340 + v} \]  
Solving gives \( v = 37.8 \, \text{ms}^{-1} \approx 38 \, \text{ms}^{-1} \). The direction is away from the observer."

This increases the angle of diffraction for each order. Since the fourth-order maximum would now occur at a larger angle, the fifth-order maximum would require sinθ > 1, which is impossible. Therefore, a fifth-order maximum cannot be formed."

Given:

When an alternating voltage is applied, the crystal vibrates to produce ultrasound waves. These waves travel into the body and reflect at boundaries between tissues of differing acoustic impedances (e.g., muscle and organ). The reflected echoes are detected by the same transducer, which converts them back into electrical signals. The time delay between transmission and reception of each echo is used to calculate the depth of the boundary (since speed of ultrasound in tissue is approximately constant). The intensity (amplitude) of the reflected pulse provides information about the nature of the boundary (e.g., fluid vs. solid tissue).

State expressions, in terms of the symbols t, Δt, N and ΔN for  the mean activity of the sample during the time interval Δt,  mean activity = ..................................... [1]",∆N/∆t A1 [1],"The mean activity of the sample during the time interval Δt is given by the number of nuclei decayed (ΔN) divided by the time interval (Δt). This represents the average rate of decay over that period. Therefore, the expression is ΔN/Δt."
499,"At time t, a sample of a radioactive isotope contains N nuclei. In a short time Δt, the number of nuclei that decay is ΔN. State expressions, in terms of the symbols t, Δt, N and ΔN for  the probability of decay of a nucleus during the time interval Δt,  probability = ......................................... [1]",∆N/N A1 [1],"The probability of decay of a nucleus during the time interval Δt is given by the ratio of the number of decayed nuclei to the total number of nuclei present. Therefore, probability = ΔN/N."
