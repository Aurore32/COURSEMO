MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2009 question paper
for the guidance of teachers
9702 PHYSICS
9702/05 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes must be read in conjunction with the question papers and the report on the
examination.
(cid:127) CIE will not enter into discussions or correspondence in connection with these mark schemes.
CIE is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2009 question papers for most IGCSE, GCE
Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level syllabuses and some Ordinary Level syllabuses.

GCE A/AS LEVEL – May/June 2009 9702 05
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P1 Vary l or l is the independent variable [Allow M] [1]
P2 Determine the period T (for each l [M]) or T is the dependent variable [1]
P3 M is kept constant [l is kept constant] [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M1 Diagram showing the cantilever is fixed e.g. g-clamp & bench, retort stand & clamp [1]
M2 Many oscillations repeated to determine average T (n [ 10 or t [ 10 s for stopwatch) [1]
M3 Weigh M using balance [1]
M4 Measure w and d and measure/record l [1]
M5 Use of vernier caliper/micrometer to measure d and/or w [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A1 Appropriate graph plotted i.e. T 2 against l 3 ; [T 2 against M] or lg T against lg l or lg M [1]
16π2M k 16π2l3
A2 E = = E =
wd3×gradient gradient wd3×gradient
k k
E = =
Allow logarithmic solutions e.g. [1]
102xy-intercept 100y-intercept
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S1 Relevant safety precaution related to the use of loads [1]
e.g. cushion/sand in case load falls, keep feet away, keep distance from experiment.
Additional detail (4 marks)
D Relevant points might include [4]
1. Use same rule or keep w and/or d constant.
2. Repeat measurements of d and/or w along rule and average.
3. Discussion of use of motion sensor e.g. orientation or light gates with detail.
4. Use small amplitude or small angle oscillations (to ensure equation is valid).
5. Method of securing load to rule e.g. with tape/glue.
6. Discussion of magnitude of load: large enough to make T large enough.
7. Use of fiducial marker to help to time.
8. Start timing after oscillations have settled.
Do not allow vague use of computers/light gates, video cameras, dataloggers.

2 Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (15 marks)
Part Mark Expected Answer Additional Guidance
(a) A1 gradient = q
y-intercept = lg p or log p
(b) T1 1.176 or 1.18 0.415 or 0.41 T1 is awarded for correct values lg d
T2 1.279 or 1.28 0.544 or 0.54 T2 is awarded for correct values lg I
1.362 or 1.36 0.643 or 0.64 A mixture of 2dp and 3dp is allowed within

1.491 or 1.49 0.806 or 0.81
E1 ± 0.016 or ± 0.017 or ± 0.02 Allow more than one significant figures.
decreasing to ± 0.006 or ± 0.007
or ± 0.01
(c) (i) G1 Five points plotted correctly Must be within half a small square. Use
transparency. Ecf allowed from table.
E2 Error bars in lg I plotted correctly. Check first and last point. Must be accurate
within half a small square. Ecf allowed from
table.
(ii) G2 Line of best fit If points are plotted correctly then lower end
of line should pass between (1.15, 0.370) and
(1.15, 0.385) and upper end of line should
pass between (1.50, 0.815) and (1.50, 0.825).
Allow ecf from points plotted incorrectly –
examiner judgement.
G3 Worst acceptable straight line. Line should be clearly labelled or dashed.
Steepest or shallowest possible Should pass from top of top error bar to
line that passes through all the bottom of bottom error bar or bottom of top
error bars. error bar to top of bottom error bar. Mark
scored only if error bars are plotted.
(iii) C1 Gradient of best fit line The triangle used should be greater than half
the length of the drawn line. Check the “read
offs”. Work to half a small square. Do not
penalise POT.
E3 Error in gradient Method of determining absolute error
Difference in worst gradient and gradient.
(iv) C2 y-intercept Must be negative and the gradient must be
used. Check substitution into c = y – mx.
Allow ecf from (c)(iii).
If gradient within range given, then y-intercept
should be about –1.1
E4 Method of determining error in Determines worst y-intercept using worst
y-intercept gradient and finds difference.
Check substitution but do not check
calculation.
Do not allow ecf from false origin read-off.

(d) C3 p = 10candidate’s y-intercept p should be about 0.08. Allow ecf from
(c)(iv).
If FO used then p should be about 2.34 to
2.43.
C4 q = in the range 1.20–1.30 and Candidate’s gradient must be used.

E5 Method for determining errors in Determines worst p using worst y-intercept
values of p and q. and finds difference. Allow ecf from (c)(iv).
q error must be same as error in gradient.

Uncertainties in Question 2
(c) (iii) Uncertainty in gradient [E3]
1. Uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
2. Uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
(c) (iv) Uncertainty in the y-intercept [E4]
1. Uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line
2. Uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line y-intercept – shallowest worst line y-intercept)
N.B. Must use gradient from worst acceptable line and a point on the same worst acceptable line
to determine y-intercept of worst acceptable line.
(d) Uncertainty in p [E5]
1. Uncertainty = p from y-intercept of BFL – p from y-intercept of WAL
2. Uncertainty = ½ (p from y-intercept of shallowest WAL – p from y-intercept of steepest
WAL)
