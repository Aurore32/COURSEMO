MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2011 question paper
for the guidance of teachers
9702 PHYSICS
9702/53 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes must be read in conjunction with the question papers and the report on the
examination.
(cid:127) Cambridge will not enter into discussions or correspondence in connection with these mark schemes.
Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2011 question papers for most IGCSE,
GCE Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level syllabuses and some Ordinary Level
syllabuses.

GCE AS/A LEVEL – May/June 2011 9702 53
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P1 p is the independent variable or vary p [1]
P2 q is the dependent variable or measure q [1]
P3 Keep (horizontal) velocity (v) constant [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M1 Labelled diagram of apparatus including method to vary p. [1]
M2 Method to determine position of ball on surface e.g. carbon paper/dye/video/sand. [1]
M3 Use ruler/caliper to measure p and/or q. [1]
M4 Method to ensure velocity is constant e.g. releasing ball from same height on a track/
spring loaded device or impulse device set to a constant value. [1]
M5 Method to ensure that the moved surface remains horizontal, e.g. spirit level/check
height at different places. [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A1 q2 against p q against p p against q2 p against q [1]
g×gradient g g 1 g
A2 v = v = gradient× v = v = × [1]
2 2 2×gradient gradient 2
Allow valid logarithmic graph e.g. lg q against lg p, lg 2p, lg 2p/g and valid calculation of v
from y-intercept.
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S Reasoned method to prevent ball rolling on floor e.g. box below/storage box for balls/
sand box.
Reasoned method to prevent ball causing injury e.g. goggles/safety screen [1]
Additional detail (4 marks)
D Relevant points might include [4]
1 Method to ensure that velocity of ball is horizontal only when it reaches table, e.g.
curved track.
2 Ensure that the ball leaves the table at 90°, e.g. set square/protractor on upper surface.
3 Detail on measuring q – location of landing position e.g. centre of crater/start of track.
4 Detail on determining location of zero position for p and q e.g. set square, plumb line.
5 Detail on method of determining position of ball e.g. slow motion playback including
scale.
6 Take many readings of q for each p and average.
2
7 Straight line through the origin shows that p is proportional to q /relationship is valid –
this mark may only be awarded when A1 is given.
8 Use of high density ball to minimise the effects of air resistance.
Do not allow vague computer methods.

2 Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (15 marks)

(a) A1 F
(b) T1 6.7 or 6.67 9.0 or 9.00 T1 for 1/R.
T2 4.5 or 4.55 6.5 or 6.50 T2 for V/E.
3.0 or 3.03 4.6 or 4.63 Must be 2sf or 3sf; a mixture is allowed
2.1 or 2.13 3.5 or 3.50
1.5 or 1.47 2.8 or 2.75
1.2 or 1.16 2.4 or 2.38
U1 From ± 0.6 or ± 0.7, to ± 0.2 Allow more than one significant figure.
(c) (i) G1 Six points plotted correctly Check second and fifth plots and other
anomalous plots. Must be less than half a
small square. Ecf allowed from table.
U2 All error bars in V/E plotted correctly Half square or greater loses the mark. Ecf
allowed from table.
(ii) G2 Line of best fit If points are plotted correctly then lower end
of line should pass between (0, 0.9) and
(0, 1.1) and upper end of line should pass
between (7, 9.3) and (7, 9.5). Allow ecf
from points plotted incorrectly – examiner
judgement.
G3 Worst acceptable straight line. Line should be clearly labelled or dashed.
Steepest or shallowest possible line Should pass from top of top error bar to
that passes through all the error bars. bottom of bottom error bar or bottom of top
error bar to top of bottom error bar. Mark
scored only if error bars are plotted.
(iii) C1 Gradient of best fit line The triangle used should be at least half the
length of the drawn line. Check the read
offs. Work to half a small square. Do not
penalise POT.
U3 Uncertainty in gradient Method of determining absolute uncertainty.
Difference in worst gradient and gradient.
(d) C2 (Gradient value) Ω Gradient must be used correctly. Expect
about 1200 Ω
Allow ecf from (c)(iii) but penalise POT.
Do not penalise sf or rounding errors.
U4 Determines uncertainty in F Allow ecf from POT.
(e) (i) C3 Determines V/E correctly. Answer should be approximately 11; F from

3sf Must be (e)(i) × 1.6

Uncertainties in Question 2
(c) (iii) Gradient [U3]
Uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
Uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
(d) [U4]
Uncertainty = uncertainty in gradient
(e) [U5]
Uncertainty = worst V/E – V/E
Note worst V/E is calculated either by max V/min E or by min V/max E
Or max gradient of WAL/114 or min gradient of WAL/126
