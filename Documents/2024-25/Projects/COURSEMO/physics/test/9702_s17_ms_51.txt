MARK SCHEME
Maximum Mark: 30
Published
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the
examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the
details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have
considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for
Teachers.
Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.
Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®,
Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level
components.

Question Answer Marks
1 Defining the problem
(sin)θ is the independent variable and v is the dependent variable or vary (sin)θ and measure v 1
keep s (PQ) constant 1
Methods of data collection
labelled diagram showing inclined plane with labelled support and P and Q marked 1
method to measure angle e.g. use a protractor to measure θ or use a ruler to measure marked distances from which sin θ or θ 1
may be determined
method of timing for an appropriate distance to determine v (at Q) e.g. use a stopwatch/timer or correctly positioned light 1
gate(s) connected to a timer/data-logger or correctly positioned motion sensor connected to data-logger
measurement of an appropriate distance to determine v (at Q) e.g. rule to measure an appropriate length or length of a card 1
to interrupt light beam or distance from motion sensor to Q
Method of analysis
plot a graph of v2 against sinθ 1
relationship valid if a straight line produced (not passing through the origin) 1

Additional detail including safety considerations Max. 6
D1 use cushion/foam/sandbox for falling body (B)
D2 (sin)θ determined using trigonometry relationship using marked lengths
2s
D3 appropriate equation to determine v (at Q) e.g. v =
t
D4 repeat experiment for each θ and average v or t
D5 use of balance to measure mass of wooden block m and falling body B and rule to measure s
2Bsg
D6 y-intercept = .
B+m
D7 clean surfaces of blocks/inclined plane/ensure surface of the plane is smooth
D8 keep B and m constant or keep mass of block and mass of falling body constant
D9 method to ensure that wooden block starts at the same position P, e.g. put a mark on the block or align front or back of
block
D10 method to prevent plane slipping so that angle being measured remains the same, e.g. a mass as a stop

Question Answer Marks
2(c)(ii) Line of best fit drawn. 1
If points are plotted correctly then upper end of line should pass between (4.8, 0.76) and (5.6, 0.76) and lower end of line
should pass between (17.6, 0.64) and (18.8, 0.64). Line should not be from first to last plot.
Worst acceptable line drawn (steepest or shallowest possible line). 1
All error bars must be plotted.
2(c)(iii) Gradient determined with a triangle that is at least half the length of the drawn line. 1
Gradient must be negative.
uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line 1
or
uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
2(c)(iv) y-intercept read-off y-axis to less than half small square or determined by substitution into y = mx + c. 1
uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line 1
or
uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line y-intercept – shallowest worst line y-intercept)
