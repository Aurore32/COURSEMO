GCE Advanced Subsidiary Level and GCE Advanced Level
MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2013 series
9702 PHYSICS
9702/53 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner
Report for Teachers.

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.
Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2013 series for most IGCSE, GCE
Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level components and some Ordinary Level components.

GCE AS/A LEVEL – May/June 2013 9702 53
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P h is the independent variable or vary h. [1]
P Q is the dependent variable or measure Q (allow t). [1]
P Keep l constant. [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M Labelled diagram of apparatus: including labelled measuring cylinder/calibrated beaker to
receive water. (Measurement may be credited in the text.) [1]
M Vary position of vertical/larger tube. [1]
M Measure h and l with a rule/caliper. [1]
M Measure d with a travelling microscope or vernier calipers. [1]
M Measure t with stopwatch. [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A Plot a graph of Q against h. [Allow lg Q against lg h] [1]
2πρgd4
A η =
l×gradient
η
Must include gradient and must be subject of formula. [1]
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S Reasoned method to prevent spills, e.g. use tray/sink/cloths on floor. Reasoned method to
prevent injury when adjusting metal/glass tubes by wearing protective gloves. Mark may not
be scored from the diagram. [1]
Additional detail (4 marks)
D Relevant points might include [4]
1 Repeat experiment for same h and average
2 Method to determine the density of water including method to measure mass and volume
and equation
3 Take many readings of d and average
4 Relationship is valid if straight line passing through origin [if lg-lg graph allow straight line with
gradient = 1]
5 Method to check that tube is horizontal
6 Detail on measuring h to the centre of the horizontal tube e.g. add radius of tube
7 Keep temperature of water constant
Do not allow vague computer methods.

(c) (i) G1 Six points plotted correctly Must be less than half a small square. Ecf allowed
from table. Penalise ‘blobs’.
U1 All error bars in C plotted Must be within half a small square. Ecf allowed
correctly from table. Horizontal.
(c) (ii) G2 Line of best fit If points are plotted correctly then lower end of line
should pass between (0.75, 0.200) and (0.75,
0.205) and upper end of line should pass between
(3.0, 0.352) and (3.0, 0.358). Allow ecf from points
plotted incorrectly – examiner judgement.
G3 Worst acceptable straight Line should be clearly labelled or dashed. Should

Steepest or shallowest error bar or bottom of top error bar to top of bottom
possible line that passes error bar. Mark scored only if error bars are plotted.

(c) (iii) C1 Gradient of best fit line The triangle used should be at least half the length
of the drawn line. Check the read offs. Work to half
a small square. Do not penalise POT.
U2 Uncertainty in gradient Method of determining absolute uncertainty
Difference in worst gradient and gradient.
(c) (iv) C2 y-intercept Expect to see point substituted into y = mx + c
FOX does not score. Do not penalise POT.
Should be about 0.15.
U3 Uncertainty in y-intercept Difference in worst y-intercept and y-intercept.
FOX does not score. Allow ecf from (c)(iv).

Uncertainties in Question 2
(c) (iii) Gradient [U2]
Uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
Uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
(c) (iv) y-intercept [U3]
Uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line
Uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line y-intercept – shallowest worst line y-intercept)
