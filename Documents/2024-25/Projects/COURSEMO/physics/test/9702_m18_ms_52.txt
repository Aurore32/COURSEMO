MARK SCHEME
Maximum Mark: 30
Published
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the
examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the
details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have
considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for
Teachers.
Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.
Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2018 series for most
Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level
components.

Generic Marking Principles
These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the
specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these
marking principles.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:
Marks must be awarded in line with:
• the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question
• the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question
• the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:
Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:
Marks must be awarded positively:
• marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the
scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate
• marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do
• marks are not deducted for errors
• marks are not deducted for omissions
• answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the
question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:
Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level
descriptors.

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:
Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may
be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:
Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or
grade descriptors in mind.

Question Answer Marks
1 Defining the problem
d is the independent variable and e is the dependent variable, or vary d and measure e. 1
Keep F constant. 1
Methods of data collection
Labelled workable diagram including elastic cord fixed at one end to a support and load attached to the other end 1
Cord and weight must be labelled
Use of ruler to measure unstretched length and stretched length. 1
or labelled ruler drawn parallel to cord and original length L and either e or stretched length indicated.
Use of a micrometer / (calipers) to determine d. 1
Weigh load on a balance or use of balance to measure mass of load and multiply by g 1
Method of Analysis
Plots a graph of e against 1 / d2 or equivalent 1
Relationship valid if a straight line passing through the origin is produced 1
4FL 1
E =
gradient×π
Additional detail including safety considerations Max 6
Use safety goggles / safety screen to prevent injury to eyes from (moving) elastic cord / load or D1
use cushion / sand box in case load falls.
Keep L constant D2
Method to keep L constant, e.g. check length of each cord / adjust through cork D3

1 Additional detail on measuring e, e.g. record initial position, record final position and subtract D4
Repeat measurement of d along cord / different diameters and average D5
Method to ensure Hooke’s law is obeyed, e.g. check that the length is constant after removing load or do not exceed elastic D6
limit
Wait for cord to extend to its maximum value / stop oscillating D7
πd2 D8
Use of A=

Use of set square to check that ruler is vertical to bench, or D9

Question Answer Marks
2(c)(i) Six points plotted correctly. 1
Must be within half a small square. Diameter of points must be less than half a small square.
Error bars in P plotted correctly. 1
All error bars to be plotted. Total length of bar must be accurate to less than half a small square and symmetrical.
2(c)(ii) Line of best fit drawn. 1
Points must be balanced.
Line must pass between (6.45, 5.8) and (6.55, 5.8) and between (4.55, 4.2) and (4.65, 4.2)
Worst acceptable line drawn. 1
Steepest or shallowest possible line that passes through all the error bars.
Mark scored only if all error bars are plotted.
2(c)(iii) Gradient determined with clear substitution of data points into ∆y/∆x; distance between data points must be at least half the 1
length of the drawn line.
