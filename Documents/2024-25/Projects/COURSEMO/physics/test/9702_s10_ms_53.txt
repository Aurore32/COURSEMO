MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2010 question paper
for the guidance of teachers
9702 PHYSICS
9702/53 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes must be read in conjunction with the question papers and the report on the
examination.
(cid:127) CIE will not enter into discussions or correspondence in connection with these mark schemes.
CIE is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2010 question papers for most IGCSE, GCE
Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level syllabuses and some Ordinary Level syllabuses.

GCE AS/A LEVEL – May/June 2010 9702 53
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P1 x is the independent variable, B is the dependent variable or vary x and measure B [1]
P2 Keep the number of turns on the coil/radius of the coil constant [1]
Do not accept same coil – ‘coil’ is not a variable
P3 Keep the current (in the coil) constant [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M1 Diagram showing coil and Hall probe with a means of read out appropriately
positioned along axis [1]
M2 Coil connected to a power supply [1]
M3 Measure x with a ruler [1]
M4 Hall probe at right angles to direction of magnetic field or gives maximum output for
each reading [1]
M5 Method to determine axis of coil or to find x = 0 [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A1 Plot a graph of ln B against x [1]
A2 Relationship valid if a straight line is produced (ignore reference to y-intercept) [1]
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S1 Precaution linked to (large) current in coil/heating, e.g. switch off when not in use to
avoid overheating coil; do not touch because it is hot [1]
Additional detail (4 marks)
D 1/2/3/4 Relevant points might include [4]
1. Method to create a large magnetic field, e.g. use large current or large number
of turns.
2. Reasoned method to keep current constant.
3. Reasoned method to keep Hall probe in same orientation (e.g. use of set
square, fix to rule, optical bench or equivalent).
4. B is proportional to voltage across Hall probe/calibrate Hall probe (in a known
magnetic field).
5. Repeat experiment with Hall probe reversed or equivalent.
6. Identifies logarithmic equation i.e. ln B = –p x + ln B
0
7. Avoid external magnetic fields.
8. Method to keep Hall probe along axis.
Do not allow vague computer methods.

should pass between (37, 1.5) and (38, 1.5) and
upper end of line should pass between (92, 3.7)

1. Uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
2. Uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
