MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2012 question paper
for the guidance of teachers
9702 PHYSICS
9702/51 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes must be read in conjunction with the question papers and the report on the
examination.
(cid:127) Cambridge will not enter into discussions or correspondence in connection with these mark schemes.
Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2012 question papers for most IGCSE,
GCE Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level syllabuses and some Ordinary Level
syllabuses.

GCE AS/A LEVEL – May/June 2012 9702 51
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P1 Frequency or period of rotation or ω is the independent variable and θ is the dependent variable
or vary f or T or ω and measure θ. [1]
P2 ω = 2πf = 2π/T [1]
P3 Keep the length of the rigid rod constant; ignore reference to mass. [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M1 Labelled diagram of apparatus: small object, pole attached to a rotating device
(motor, turntable). [1]
M2 Method to change the speed of the rotating device. [1]
M3 Method to determine frequency or time period (e.g. stop watch to time a number of rotations,
rev counter/tachometer, light gates connected to a timer/frequency meter). [1]
M4 Use fiducial mark or light gates perpendicular to motion of object. [1]
M5 Method to measure angle – use protractor or rule for measurements for trigonometry methods.
This must be shown correctly on diagram or explained in text. [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A1 Plot a graph of cos θ against 1/ω 2 . [1]
A2 Relationship is valid if straight line through the origin [1]
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S1 Use a protective screen in case mass detaches from the pole. Do not use goggles. [1]
Additional detail (4 marks)
Relevant points might include [4]
1 Large motor speed to produce measurable θ.
2 Additional detail on measuring angle e.g. large protractor fixed to pole.
3 Projection method, slow motion freeze frame video, camera with detail.
4 cos θ = h/l or equivalent.
5 Method of checking pole is vertical – use a set square.
6 Additional detail on measuring angular velocity, e.g. time at least 10 rotations.
7 Wait for motion to become stable.
Do not allow vague computer methods.

Uncertainties in Question 2
(c) (iii) Gradient [U3]
Uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
