MARK SCHEME
Maximum Mark: 30
Published
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the
examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the
details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have
considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for
Teachers.
Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

Cambridge International AS/A Level – May/June 2016 9702 53
Question 1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (2 marks)
P λ is the independent variable, or vary λ. [1]
P V is the dependent variable, or measure V. [1]
Methods of data collection (4 marks)
M Circuit diagram showing d.c. power supply in series with diode (correct symbol needed) and
method to measure potential difference across diode. Circuit must be correct. [1]
M Instrument to change p.d. across LED e.g. variable power supply/potential divider/variable
resistor. [1]
M Record wavelength of light of LED from data sheet or use Young’s slits/diffraction grating. [1]
M (Slowly) increase potential difference across LED until LED (just) emits light (or reverse
procedure). [1]
Method of analysis (3 marks)
A Plot a graph of lg V against lg λ (allow natural logs). Allow lg λ against lg V. [1]
A n = gradient [1]
A k = 10y-intercept [1]
Additional detail (6 marks)
Relevant points might include: [6]
1 Use of a protective resistor (can be shown on the diagram).
2 Polarity of LED correct in circuit diagram.
3 Instrument to determine when LED just lights e.g. light meter/detector, LDR.
4 Method to use light detector/LDR to determine point at which LED emits light.
5 Expression that gives λ (symbols need to defined) from experimental determination of
wavelength of light, e.g. Young’s slits/diffraction grating.
6 Perform experiment in a dark room/LED in tube.
7 Relationship is valid if graph is a straight line.
8 lgV =nlgλ +lgk
9 Repeat V and average for the same λ or LED.
Do not allow vague computer methods.
