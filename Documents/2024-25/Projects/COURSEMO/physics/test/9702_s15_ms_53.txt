MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2015 series
9702 PHYSICS
9702/53 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner
Report for Teachers.
Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

Cambridge International AS/A Level – May/June 2015 9702 53
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P V is the independent variable, or vary V and f is the dependent variable, or
measure f.
Or f is the independent variable, or vary f and V is the dependent variable, or
measure V. [1]
P Change f (allow V) until the mass leaves/gap between plate. [1]
P Keep the position of the mass constant. (Do not allow keep mass constant.) [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M Labelled diagram showing signal generator/a.c. supply connected to vibrator with
two wires with mass on plate. At least two labels needed. [1]
M Voltmeter/c.r.o. connected in parallel with vibrator in a workable circuit. [1]
M Measure f or T from signal generator/c.r.o. (Allow detailed use of motion
sensor/stroboscope.) [1]
M Detail regarding mass leaving the plate: listen to noise, look for gap. [1]
M Repeat each experiment for the same value of V (allow f if consistent with above)
and average. [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
Plot a graph of:
f 2 1 / V f 1 / V lg V lg f
A against against against against against against
1 / V f 2 1 / V f lg f lg V
or or or or
V 1 / f 2 V 1 / f
against against against against [1]
1 / f 2 V 1 / f V
k = π2 k = π2
A gradient×π2 k =
gradient
gradient2 × π2 k = gradient2 k = π2×10c k =π2×102c [1]
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S Precaution linked to mass leaving vibrating plate, e.g. use safety
screen/goggles/sand tray. [1]

Additional detail (4 marks)
D Relevant points might include [4]
1 Wait for vibrator to oscillate evenly
2 Method to determine period of oscillation from c.r.o., i.e. one time period × time-base
3 Method to determine f from c.r.o. having determined T, i.e. f = 1/T
4 Method to determine V from c.r.o, i.e. amplitude (height) × y-gain
5 Relationship is valid if the graph is a straight line passing through the origin
[For lg – lg graph the gradient must be correct (–2 or –0.5)]
6 Determine f (allow V if consistent with above) by increasing and decreasing V or f
7 Clean surfaces of metal plate/small mass
8 Spirit level to keep plate horizontal/eye level to look for gap
Do not allow vague computer methods.

2 Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (15 marks)
Mark Expected Answer Additional Guidance
(a) A1 gradient = m
y-intercept = lg k
(b) T1 Allow a mixture of significant figures.
T2 1.70 or 1.699 1.312 or 1.3118 T1 (first column) and T2 (second column)
must be values in table.
1.79 or 1.785 1.204 or 1.2041
1.85 or 1.851 1.114 or 1.1139
1.90 or 1.903 1.041 or 1.0414
1.95 or 1.954 0.98 or 0.978
2.00 or 1.996 0.90 or 0.903
U1 From ±0.01 to ±0.03 Allow more than one significant figure.
(c) (i) G1 Six points plotted correctly Must be within half a small square.
Do not allow “blobs”.
Ecf allowed from table.
U2 Error bars in lg P plotted correctly All error bars to be plotted. Must be
accurate to less than half a small square.
(ii) G2 Line of best fit Upper end of line must pass between
(1.75, 1.24) and (1.75, 1.255) and lower
end of line must pass between (2.00, 0.900)
and (2.00, 0.915).
G3 Worst acceptable straight line. Line should be clearly labelled or dashed.
Steepest or shallowest possible Examiner judgement on worst acceptable
line that passes through all the line. Lines must cross. Mark scored only if
error bars. error bars are plotted.
(iii) C1 Gradient of line of best fit Must be negative. The triangle used should
be at least half the length of the drawn line.
Check the read-offs. Work to half a small
square. Do not penalise POT. (Should be
about –1.35.)
U3 Uncertainty in gradient Method of determining absolute uncertainty:
difference in worst gradient and gradient.
(iv) C2 y-intercept Check substitution into y = mx + c.
Allow ecf from (c)(iii).
(Should be about 4.)
Do not allow read-off of false origin.

U4 Uncertainty in y-intercept Uses worst gradient and point on worst
acceptable line.
Do not check calculation. Do not allow if
false origin used.
(d) (i) C3 k = 10y-intercept
C4 m = gradient and given to 2 or 3 s.f. Must be negative.
and in the range –1.30 to –1.44 Allow –1.3 or –1.4 (2 s.f.)
(ii) U5 Percentage uncertainty in k
Uncertainties in Question 2
(c) (iii) Gradient [U3]
uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
(iv) [U4]
uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line
uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line y-intercept – shallowest worst line y-intercept)
(d) (ii) [U5]
max k = 10max y-intercept and min k = 10min y-intercept
1( )
max k −min k
max k −k k −min k

percentage uncertainty = ×100 = ×100 = ×100
