MARK SCHEME
Maximum Mark: 30
Published
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the
examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the
details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have
considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for
Teachers.
Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.
Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2019 series for most
Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and
some Cambridge O Level components.
This document consists of 8 printed pages.

Generic Marking Principles
These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the
specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these
marking principles.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:
Marks must be awarded in line with:
• the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question
• the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question
• the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:
Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:
Marks must be awarded positively:
• marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the
scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate
• marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do
• marks are not deducted for errors
• marks are not deducted for omissions
• answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the
question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:
Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level
descriptors.

PUBLISHED
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:
Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may
be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:
Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or
grade descriptors in mind.

Question Answer Marks
1 Defining the problem
L is the independent variable and s is the dependent variable or vary L and measure s 1
keep mass of load or M constant 1
Methods of data collection
labelled diagram of workable experiment including: 1
• method of fixing strip at one end, e.g. with a G-clamp or (heavy) mass placed on top of strip over bench
• load shown touching at point P
• load and G-clamp or (heavy) mass labelled
method of attaching load to strip, e.g. use glue/tape/attach with a hook and string 1
use a rule to measure L and s 1
use a balance to measure M 1
Method of analysis
plot a graph of s against L3 (allow lg s against lg L, or log) 1
relationship valid if a straight line through (0,0) 1
(for lg s against lg L gradient of straight line = 3)
4Mg 1
E =
bt3×gradient

(for lg s against lg L, E = ÷10y−intercept)

Question Answer Marks
1 Additional detail including safety considerations Max. 6
D1 use cushion/foam/sandbox in case mass/load falls
or
wear goggles in case strip snaps or recoils
D2 use same wooden strip or keep b and t constant
D3 clamp rule vertically to measure s
D4 method to ensure clamped rule to measure s is vertical, e.g. correctly positioned set square indicated at right angles to
the horizontal surface or plumb line shown in appropriate position
D5 s = reading of vertical rule with loaded strip – reading of vertical rule with no load
D6 repeat s measurement for each L (unloading and loading strip) and average s
D7 use a micrometer/calipers to determine t
D8 repeat readings for b and/or t at different points along/across the strip and average
D9 method to ensure strip is perpendicular to the bench, e.g. repeat measurements of L on each side of strip to check that
L is constant or set square correctly indicated on diagram
D10 wait until block is stationary/in equilibrium or measure s after a fixed time
