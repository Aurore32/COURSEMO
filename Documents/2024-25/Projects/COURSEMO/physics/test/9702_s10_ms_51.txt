MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2010 question paper
for the guidance of teachers
9702 PHYSICS
9702/51 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes must be read in conjunction with the question papers and the report on the
examination.
(cid:127) CIE will not enter into discussions or correspondence in connection with these mark schemes.
CIE is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2010 question papers for most IGCSE, GCE
Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level syllabuses and some Ordinary Level syllabuses.

GCE AS/A LEVEL – May/June 2010 9702 51
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P1 Vary v and measure d, or v is the independent variable and d is the dependent
variable [1]
P2 Keep mass constant [1]
P3 Keep the wood constant/keep same type of nails [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M1 Diagram of apparatus showing mass falling onto centre of nail [1]
M2 Change height of falling mass (to change v) [1]
M3 Measurement(s) from which v can be determined, e.g. measure height fallen; light
gate(s) connected to timer/data-logger measuring time, and ticker tape/motion
sensor. Do not award stopwatch methods. [1]
M4 Appropriate equation to determine v (the velocity of the mass at the instant it hits the
nail) [1]
M5 Detail on measuring d ; subtract, needle, mark nail, depth gauge [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A1 Plot a graph of log d against log v [1]
A2 n = gradient [1]
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S1 Precaution linked to falling masses, e.g. keep well away/sand trays [1]
Additional detail (4 marks)
D 1/2/3/4 Relevant points might include [4]
1. Method to create a large d, e.g. large mass, thin nails, soft wood
2. Use of a guide for falling mass/guide for nail
3. Use of vernier scale to measure d
4. Repeat experiment and determine an average
5. Use different part of wood for each test
6. Method to make nail vertical e.g. set square
7. Discussion / preliminary experiment about thin nails going totally into wood
8. lg d = n lg v + lg k
