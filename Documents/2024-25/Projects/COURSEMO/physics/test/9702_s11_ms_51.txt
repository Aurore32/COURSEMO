MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2011 question paper
for the guidance of teachers
9702 PHYSICS
9702/51 Paper 5 (Planning, Analysis and Evaluation),
maximum raw mark 30
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of
the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not
indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,
which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes must be read in conjunction with the question papers and the report on the
examination.
(cid:127) Cambridge will not enter into discussions or correspondence in connection with these mark schemes.
Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2011 question papers for most IGCSE,
GCE Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level syllabuses and some Ordinary Level
syllabuses.

GCE AS/A LEVEL – May/June 2011 9702 51
1 Planning (15 marks)
Defining the problem (3 marks)
P1 n is the independent variable and V is the dependent variable or vary n and measure V [1]
P2 Keep distance from light to photocell constant [1]
P3 Keep intensity of light constant. Allow constant voltage across lamp/current through
lamp/brightness. Do not allow ‘same lamp/output’. [1]
Methods of data collection (5 marks)
M1 Labelled diagram of apparatus: lamp, glass sheet and photocell in line. [1]
M2 Voltmeter connected to photocell. Penalise unworkable photocell circuit. [1]
M3 Use micrometer (screw gauge) to measure thickness of glass sheet. [1]
M4 Take many readings of thickness and average. [1]
M5 Perform experiment in a dark room or shield apparatus. [1]
Method of analysis (2 marks)
A1 Plot a graph of lnV against n. Allow lnV against nt [1]
A2 α = (–)gradient/t. (lnV against nt then α = (–)gradient) [1]
Safety considerations (1 mark)
S Reasoned method to prevent burns from hot source, e.g. use gloves
Reasoned method to prevent eye damage from bright/intense source, e.g. shield lamp/
dark glasses/do not look at source directly
Reasoned method to prevent cuts from glass e.g. use gloves. [1]
Additional detail (4 marks)
D Relevant points might include [4]
1 Use small distance/high intensity to gain large reading.
2 Method to check output of lamp is constant e.g. measure current through/p.d. across
lamp/regularly check V with no glass.
0
3 Reasoned method to ensure output of lamp is constant e.g. workable circuit diagram
with variable resistor or variable power supply.
4 Clean sheets of glass before use.
5 Direction of light is perpendicular to glass sheets/constant orientation.
6 lnV = –αnt + lnV .
0
7 Further safety consideration.
Do not allow vague computer methods.

anomalous plots. Must be less than half a
small square. Ecf allowed from table.
U2 1 Half square or greater loses the mark. Ecf

h allowed from table.
(ii) G2 Line of best fit If points are plotted correctly then lower end
of line should pass between (2.20, 1.0) and
(2.30, 1.0) and upper end of line should
pass between (4.75, 2.1) and (4.85, 2.1).
Allow ecf from points plotted incorrectly –
examiner judgement.
G3 Worst acceptable straight line. Line should be clearly labelled or dashed.
Steepest or shallowest possible line Should pass from top of top error bar to
that passes through all the error bars. bottom of bottom error bar or bottom of top
error bar to top of bottom error bar. Mark
scored only if error bars are plotted.
(iii) C1 Gradient of best fit line The triangle used should be at least half the
length of the drawn line. Check the read
offs. Work to half a small square. Do not
penalise POT.
