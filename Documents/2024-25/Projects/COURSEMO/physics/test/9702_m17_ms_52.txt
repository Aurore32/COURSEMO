MARK SCHEME
Maximum Mark: 30
Published
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the
examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the
details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have
considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for
Teachers.
Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.
Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®,
Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

Question Answer Marks
1 Defining the problem
M is the independent variable and v is the dependent variable, or vary M and measure v 1
keep x/compression of spring constant 1
Methods of data collection
labelled diagram including horizontal spring in line with vehicle attached to wall/retort stand 1
use a ruler/calliper to determine compression of spring 1
use of stopwatch/use of light gate connected to a timer/motion sensor correctly positioned 1
use of balance to measure mass of vehicle M 1
Method of Analysis
plots a graph of 1/v2 against M 1
[Do not allow lg-lg graphs]
relationship valid if a straight line produced 1

Question Answer Marks
Additional detail including safety considerations Max 6
D1 use safety screen; use goggles to avoid ball/spring hitting eye
D2 add masses to the vehicle to change M
D3 repeat experiment for each M and average v
D4 use of ruler to measure an appropriate distance for the time taken in stopwatch/light gate methods
D5 method to determine speed of vehicle, e.g. time vehicle over a measured distance and use speed = distance/time
D6 method to release ball with guide or support for spring /ball
D7 release the ball close to the vehicle
D8 detail on determining x e.g. difference between compressed length and original length
D9 method to ensure constant speed along track, e.g. friction compensate track/use of air track
b
D10 (relationship valid if a straight line produced) with (y-)intercept =

must be within half a small square
error bars in 1/P plotted correctly 1
all error bars to be plotted
2(c)(ii) line of best fit drawn 1
If points are plotted correctly then lower end of line should pass between (1.50, 0.70) and (1.65, 0.70) and upper end of
line should pass between (3.60, 1.40) and (3.80, 1.40).
worst acceptable line drawn 1

Question Answer Marks
2(c)(iii) gradient determined with a triangle that is at least half the length of the drawn line 1
uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line 1
or
uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line gradient – shallowest worst line gradient)
2(c)(iv) y-intercept determined by substitution into y = mx + c 1
uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line 1
or
uncertainty = ½ (steepest worst line y-intercept – shallowest worst line y-intercept).
2(d)(i) E determined with correct unit using y-intercept 1
1
E =
y −intercept
Q determined with correct unit using gradient and given to two or three significant figures 1
penalise power of ten errors
correct substitution of numbers must be seen
gradient
Q =E×gradient =
y −intercept
2(d)(ii) percentage uncertainty in Q 1
correct substitution of numbers must be seen
%uncertainty E + %uncertainty in gradient or %uncertainty in y-intercept + %uncertainty in gradient
Maximum/minimum methods
