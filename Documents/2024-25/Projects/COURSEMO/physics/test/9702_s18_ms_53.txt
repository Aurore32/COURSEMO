MARK SCHEME
Maximum Mark: 30
Published
This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the
examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the
details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have
considered the acceptability of alternative answers.
Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for
Teachers.
Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.
Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2018 series for most
Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and
some Cambridge O Level components.

Generic Marking Principles
These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the
specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these
marking principles.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:
Marks must be awarded in line with:
• the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question
• the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question
• the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:
Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:
Marks must be awarded positively:
• marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the
scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate
• marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do
• marks are not deducted for errors
• marks are not deducted for omissions
• answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the
question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:
Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level
descriptors.

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:
Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may
be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:
Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or
grade descriptors in mind.

Question Answer Marks
1 Defining the problem
V is the independent variable and F is the dependent variable or vary V and measure F. 1
keep r constant 1
Methods of data collection
labelled diagram of workable experiment including: 1
• T suspended (clamp or ceiling)
• S on top-pan balance vertically below T
• T and S labelled and at least one other label.
F = difference/change in balance readings when sphere(s) (S) is uncharged and charged. 1
voltmeter across a power supply (with flying lead) or read V from high voltage power supply/EHT power supply 1
measure r with a rule 1
Method of analysis
plot a graph of F against V (allow valid log-log graphs) 1
relationship valid if a straight line passing through the origin is produced 1
α = gradient × r2 (consistent with graph) 1

Question Answer Marks
Additional detail including safety considerations Max. 6
D1 safety precaution linked to avoiding shock/high voltages, e.g. insulating gloves to hold flying lead/to charge sphere/to
avoid electrocution or use shrouded leads/ensure that there no bare connections/avoid touching metal parts
D2 use of insulator between sphere S and balance or between sphere T and stand
D3 discharge sphere(s) by earthing or connecting to the negative of the power supply
D4 additional detail to determine r e.g. determine radius of each sphere and add distance between spheres or measure
from top of S to top of T etc.
D5 use of calipers/micrometer to measure diameter of spheres (and halve) to determine r
or
use of calipers/micrometer to measure diameter of spheres to check that spheres are the same diameter to determine r
or
use of fiducial mark and ruler from top of spheres etc.
D6 use of ∆mg to determine F
D7 repeat experiment for each value of V and average F
D8 take reading of balance quickly to avoid discharge/keep other charged objects away
D9 method to ensure charge on S is constant, e.g. re-charge S periodically/regularly (with initial value of p.d.)/keep S
connected to a separate positive terminal
D10 avoid draughts to prevent T moving
