0,"A student is interested in ‘bungee jumping’, where a person attached to an elastic cord falls from a height and travels downwards through a distance before moving upwards. Different cords are used for different people. A schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1.1.  

The student models ‘bungee jumping’ in the laboratory by using elastic cords of unstretched length 50.0 cm with different spring constants. An object is attached to each cord.  
The student investigates the relationship between the maximum distance \( h \) fallen by the object and the spring constant \( k \) of the elastic cord.  
It is suggested that the relationship between \( h \) and \( k \) is  
\[ k(h - L)^2 = mgh \]  
where \( L \) is the unstretched length of the cord, \( m \) is the mass of the object and \( g \) is the acceleration of free fall.  
Design a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \( h \) and \( k \).  
Explain how your results could be used to plot a graph with \( \frac{(h - L)^2}{h} \) on the \( y \)-axis and to determine the value of \( g \). You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment.  
In your account you should pay particular attention to  
• the procedure to be followed,  
• the measurements to be taken,  
• the control of variables,  
• the analysis of the data,  
• any safety precautions to be taken.","**Defining the problem**  
The spring constant \( k \) of the elastic cord is the independent variable, to be varied by using cords with different \( k \) values, while the maximum distance fallen \( h \) is the dependent variable, measured for each cord. The mass \( m \) of the object and the unstretched length \( L \) of the cord must be kept constant throughout the experiment to isolate the relationship between \( k \) and \( h \).  

**Methods of data collection**  
First, measure the unstretched length \( L \) of each cord as 50.0 cm using a metre rule, ensuring the cord is taut but not extended. Measure the mass \( m \) of the object using a digital balance with a precision of 0.1 g. To determine \( k \) for each cord, suspend the cord vertically from a fixed clamp on a retort stand, attach the object, and measure the extension \( e \) with the metre rule by recording the stretched length and subtracting \( L \). Calculate \( k \) using \( k = \frac{mg}{e} \), where \( g \) is approximated as 9.81 m/s². For each cord, attach the object to one end and fix the other end to the clamp. Release the object from rest at the starting point (aligned with the top of the ruler) and measure \( h \)—the maximum distance fallen—using the metre rule positioned vertically. Mark the lowest point of the object's descent on the ruler, ensuring measurements are taken from the release point to this minimum position.  
(DIAGRAM: A retort stand with a clamp securing one end of the elastic cord; the object attached to the free end. A vertical metre rule is fixed parallel to the cord using a set square for alignment. The unstretched cord length \( L \) and the release point are labelled, with an arrow indicating \( h \) downwards from the release point.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the given equation \( k(h - L)^2 = mgh \) to \( \frac{(h - L)^2}{h} = \frac{mg}{k} \). Plot a graph of \( \frac{(h - L)^2}{h} \) (on the y-axis) against \( \frac{1}{k} \) (on the x-axis). The relationship is valid if this graph yields a straight line passing through the origin. The gradient of this line equals \( mg \), so the acceleration due to gravity \( g \) is calculated as \( g = \frac{\text{gradient}}{m} \).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Conduct three or more trials for each cord to determine an average \( h \), reducing random errors. Fix the ruler vertically using a retort stand and confirm alignment with a set square to prevent parallax errors. Ensure the cord obeys Hooke's law by verifying that extensions during \( k \) measurements are within the elastic limit; discard cords exhibiting permanent deformation. Perform a trial experiment to adjust the setup so the object does not strike the bench, using a sand tray beneath to cushion accidental impacts. Wear safety goggles to protect eyes from snapping cords or flying objects. Maintain a constant release point by marking it on the ruler and using an electromagnet to release the object identically each time. Measure \( h \) more accurately via video recording with slow-motion playback, tracking the object's lowest position frame by frame."
1,"1 A student is investigating the speed of a vehicle on a track when a small ball is projected into the vehicle, as shown in Fig. 1.1.

track  

Fig. 1.1  

The ball is projected towards the vehicle by a compressed spring. It is suggested that the relationship between the speed \(v\) of the vehicle and its mass \(M\), after the ball embeds itself in the vehicle, is  

\[
k x^2 = (M + b) v^2
\]  

where \(b\) is the mass of the ball, \(k\) is the spring constant and \(x\) is the compression of the spring.  

Design a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \(v\) and \(M\). Explain how your results could be used to plot a graph with \(1/v^2\) on the \(y\)-axis and to determine a value for \(k\). You should draw a diagram, on page 3, showing the arrangement of your equipment.  

In your account you should pay particular attention to  
- the procedure to be followed  
- the measurements to be taken  
- the control of variables  
- the analysis of the data  
- any safety precautions to be taken.  

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The mass of the vehicle \(M\) is the independent variable, to be varied by adding known masses. The speed of the vehicle after the ball embeds \(v\) is the dependent variable, measured at a consistent point post-collision. The compression of the spring \(x\) must be held constant for all trials, as it is a control variable. The mass of the ball \(b\) must also remain unchanged throughout the experiment.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up a horizontal track (e.g., friction-compensated or air track) with a vehicle initially at rest. Fix a spring horizontally to a rigid support (e.g., wall or retort stand) aligned with the track. Measure the uncompressed length of the spring \(L_0\) using a vernier caliper. Compress the spring by distance \(x\) (e.g., 5.0 cm), measured as \(x = L_0 - L_{\text{compressed}}\) using the caliper, and place the ball against it. Release the spring to project the ball into the vehicle. Measure \(M\) (vehicle plus added masses) using a digital balance (±0.01 g). Determine \(v\) via a light gate positioned beyond the collision point: attach a card of known length \(L\) (e.g., 10.0 cm, measured with caliper) to the vehicle; the light gate connected to a timer records time \(t\) for the card to interrupt the beam, giving \(v = L/t\). Ensure the track is level using a spirit level.  

(DIAGRAM: Horizontal track with spring fixed to retort stand at one end; vehicle aligned with spring. Light gate positioned 0.5 m beyond collision point, connected to timer. Caliper shown measuring spring compression.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the equation to linear form: \(k x^2 = (M + b) v^2\) becomes \(\frac{1}{v^2} = \frac{M}{k x^2} + \frac{b}{k x^2}\). Plot \(\frac{1}{v^2}\) (y-axis) against \(M\) (x-axis). A straight-line graph validates the relationship. The gradient \(m = \frac{1}{k x^2}\), so \(k = \frac{1}{m x^2}\). The y-intercept \(c = \frac{b}{k x^2}\), so \(k = \frac{b}{c x^2}\). Consistency between \(k\) values from gradient and intercept confirms reliability.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear safety goggles to protect eyes from spring recoil or ball projection, and use a transparent acrylic screen between apparatus and observer. Repeat timing for each \(M\) at least three times to average \(v\), reducing random errors. Add masses incrementally (e.g., 20 g steps) to vary \(M\) while keeping \(b\) unchanged. Measure \(x\) repeatedly before each trial using caliper fiducial markers to ensure consistency. For friction reduction, use an air track or lubricate surfaces; verify minimal friction by ensuring vehicle glides uniformly pre-collision. Guide the spring with a sleeve to prevent buckling during compression. Position the light gate sufficiently far from the collision point (e.g., 50 cm) to ensure constant \(v\) is attained. Calibrate the balance and light gate timer for zero error. The linearity of the \(\frac{1}{v^2}\)-vs-\(M\) graph confirms validity, with intercept \(c = \frac{b}{k x^2}\) providing a consistency check."
2,"A student is investigating how the extension \( e \) of an elastic cord depends on the diameter \( d \) of the cord when a force is applied.  

The student has a number of elastic cords of the same material with different diameters. The elastic cords have circular cross-sections. Each cord has an unstretched length of approximately 50 cm.  

It is suggested that the extension \( e \) and the cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cord are related by the expression  

\[
\frac{FL}{Ae} = E
\]  

where \( E \) is the Young modulus of the material of the cord, \( F \) is the force applied and \( L \) is the unstretched length of the cord.  

Design a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \( e \) and \( d \). Explain how your results could be used to determine a value for \( E \).  

You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
- the procedure to be followed,  
- the measurements to be taken,  
- the control of variables,  
- the analysis of the data,  
- any safety precautions to be taken.","In this experiment, the diameter \( d \) of the elastic cord is the independent variable, which will be systematically varied by selecting cords of different diameters, while the extension \( e \) is the dependent variable to be measured. The force \( F \) applied to the cord and the unstretched length \( L \) of the cord must be kept constant to isolate the relationship between \( e \) and \( d \). The material of all cords is identical, ensuring the Young modulus \( E \) remains consistent across trials, and the cross-sectional area \( A \) is derived from \( d \) via \( A = \pi d^2 / 4 \), so controlling \( d \) inherently determines \( A \).  

To collect data, set up a vertical support stand with a clamp securing one end of the elastic cord. Attach a known load to the free end to apply a constant force \( F \), calculated by measuring the mass of the load using a digital balance (e.g., with 0.1 g precision) and multiplying by the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²). Measure the unstretched length \( L \) of each cord using a meter rule positioned parallel to the cord, aligning the rule with fiducial markers at the fixed and free ends to ensure accuracy. After attaching the load, measure the stretched length with the same rule, waiting for oscillations to cease to avoid parallax errors, and calculate extension \( e \) as the difference between stretched and unstretched lengths. Measure the diameter \( d \) using a micrometer screw gauge, taking at least three readings at different positions along the cord and rotating the cord between measurements to account for irregularities, then average the values.  
(DIAGRAM: A vertical stand with a clamp holding one end of the elastic cord; a load attached to the free end; a meter rule fixed parallel to the cord; a set square placed at the base to ensure vertical alignment of the rule; fiducial markers indicating initial and final positions for length measurements.)  

For analysis, rearrange the given equation \( \frac{FL}{Ae} = E \) to \( e = \frac{4FL}{\pi E d^2} \), showing \( e \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{d^2} \). Plot a graph of \( e \) (y-axis) against \( \frac{1}{d^2} \) (x-axis). If the relationship is valid, the data will form a straight line passing through the origin, as \( e = 0 \) when \( d \) is infinite. Calculate the gradient of the best-fit line, which equals \( \frac{4FL}{\pi E} \). Rearrange to find \( E = \frac{4FL}{\pi \times \text{gradient}} \), using the constant \( F \) and \( L \) measured earlier.  

Key safety precautions include wearing safety goggles to protect against snapping cords or falling loads, and placing a sand tray or cushioned block beneath the load to catch it if detached. Control variables by verifying \( L \) is exactly 50 cm for each cord using the meter rule and adjusting the clamp position as needed, and using the same load for all trials to maintain constant \( F \). Improve accuracy by repeating extension measurements three times per cord and averaging \( e \), ensuring readings are taken only after oscillations stop to record maximum equilibrium extension. Confirm Hooke’s law compliance by checking cords return to original length after load removal, using loads within the elastic limit. Enhance length measurements with a set square to keep the ruler vertical and act as a fiducial marker for precise readings."
3,"1 A student is investigating the behaviour of a capacitor-resistor circuit as shown in Fig. 1.1.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\caption{Fig. 1.1}
\end{figure}

A neon lamp flashes on and off when it is connected across the capacitor with a potential difference \( V \) across the lamp of approximately 90 V.  

The student has a number of unmarked resistors.  
It is suggested that the period \( T \) of the flashes of the lamp is related to the resistance \( R \) of the resistor by the expression  
\[
T = RCK
\]  
where \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor and \( K \) is a constant.  

The constant \( K \) is given by  
\[
K = \ln\left(\frac{V_i - V_L}{V_i - V_F}\right)
\]  
where \( V_i \) is the potential difference across the input, \( V_F \) is the potential difference required to make the lamp flash and \( V_L \) is a constant.  

Design a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \( T \) and \( R \).  
Explain how your results could be used to determine a value for \( K \) and \( V_L \).  

You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to:  
• the procedure to be followed  
• the measurements to be taken  
• the control of variables  
• the analysis of the data  
• any safety precautions to be taken.","**Defining the problem**  
The resistance \( R \) of the resistor is the independent variable, to be deliberately varied, while the period \( T \) of the neon lamp's flashes is the dependent variable, to be measured. The capacitance \( C \) of the capacitor and the input potential difference \( V_i \) must be kept constant throughout the experiment. Additionally, the flash voltage \( V_F \) (approximately 90 V) is intrinsic to the lamp but must be verified and monitored, while \( V_L \) is a constant to be determined from analysis.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Construct the circuit with a d.c. power supply set to a fixed \( V_i \) (e.g., 100 V), connected in series with one of the unmarked resistors and the capacitor. Connect the neon lamp directly across the capacitor terminals. Measure \( R \) for each resistor using a digital ohmmeter, ensuring the resistor is disconnected from the circuit during measurement. Measure \( V_i \) using a voltmeter across the power supply terminals. Determine \( V_F \) by observing the capacitor voltage with an oscilloscope: when the lamp flashes, record the peak voltage just before discharge. To measure \( T \), use a stopwatch to time 10 consecutive flashes and divide by 10 for the period, repeating this three times per resistor to average. Measure \( C \) using a capacitance meter if unmarked, or use a pre-calibrated capacitor.  
(DIAGRAM: Circuit with power supply, series resistor, parallel capacitor-neon lamp pair; voltmeter across supply; oscilloscope probes across capacitor; ohmmeter measuring a disconnected resistor.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Plot a graph of \( T \) (y-axis) against \( R \) (x-axis). The relationship \( T = RCK \) predicts a straight line through the origin. Calculate the gradient of the best-fit line. Since \( C \) is known, compute \( K = \text{gradient} / C \). To determine \( V_L \), use the equation \( V_L = V_i - (V_i - V_F)e^{K} \), where \( V_i \) and \( V_F \) are measured values and \( K \) is derived. For validation, the linear proportionality of \( T \) to \( R \) confirms the relationship.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Safety: Use insulating gloves when handling high-voltage components (>90 V), and ensure the power supply is switched off during resistor changes to prevent electric shock. Control variables: Maintain fixed \( V_i \) via a stabilized power supply monitored with a voltmeter, and use the same capacitor to fix \( C \). Improvements: Measure \( T \) using an oscilloscope for higher precision—trigger on voltage spikes to capture flash intervals directly. For accuracy, repeat \( T \) measurements 3–5 times per resistor and average, while timing ≥10 flashes per trial to minimize reaction-time errors. Pre-screen resistors with an ohmmeter to select a wide range (e.g., 10 kΩ to 1 MΩ) ensuring measurable \( T \). Verify \( V_F \) and \( V_L \) via oscilloscope traces: \( V_F \) is the maximum voltage pre-flash, and \( V_L \) is the stable voltage post-flash. Confirm linearity by checking the graph passes through the origin. Use large \( R \) or \( C \) values to extend \( T \) beyond 5 seconds for reliable timing. Calibrate the ohmmeter with known resistors before use."

Fig. 1.1  

The bar magnet is displaced a distance \( x \) from its equilibrium position and released. It then oscillates vertically.  

A student investigates how the maximum induced electromotive force (e.m.f.) \( E \) in a coil placed below the magnet depends on \( x \).  

It is suggested that the relationship between \( E \) and \( x \) is  

\[
E = \alpha B N x \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]  

where \( B \) is the magnetic flux density at one of the poles of the bar magnet, \( N \) is the number of turns on the coil, \( k \) is the spring constant, \( m \) is the mass of the magnet and \( \alpha \) is a constant.  

Design a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \( E \) and \( x \).  

Explain how your results could be used to determine a value for \( \alpha \).  

You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to:  
- the procedure to be followed  
- the measurements to be taken  
- the control of variables  
- the analysis of the data  
- any safety precautions to be taken.","In this experiment, the displacement \( x \) from equilibrium is the independent variable to be varied, while the maximum induced electromotive force \( E \) is the dependent variable to be measured. The magnetic flux density \( B \) at one pole of the magnet, the mass \( m \) of the magnet, the spring constant \( k \), and the number of turns \( N \) on the coil must all be rigorously controlled to isolate the relationship between \( E \) and \( x \).  

To collect data, securely clamp a vertical spring to a retort stand, attaching a bar magnet to its free end. Position a flat-bottomed coil directly below the magnet, ensuring the magnet's axis aligns perpendicularly with the coil plane when at equilibrium. Connect the coil terminals to an oscilloscope set to measure peak voltage or a peak-reading digital voltmeter. Measure \( x \) using a vertical meter ruler fixed parallel to the spring with a set square to ensure verticality; mark equilibrium and displaced positions for accuracy. Determine \( m \) by weighing the magnet with a digital balance of ±0.1 g resolution. For each trial, displace the magnet vertically by \( x \) (e.g., 1.0 cm increments), release it, and record the peak \( E \) value from the oscilloscope trace or voltmeter. (DIAGRAM: Retort stand clamping a vertical spring with attached bar magnet; a coil below aligned with the magnet's axis; a vertically fixed meter ruler beside the setup; oscilloscope connected to the coil via leads.)  

For analysis, plot \( E \) on the y-axis against \( x \) on the x-axis. If the suggested relationship holds, the graph will yield a straight line passing through the origin. Calculate the gradient of this line using linear regression. To determine \( \alpha \), first measure \( B \) at the magnet's pole with a calibrated Hall probe (angled for maximum reading and averaged over opposing orientations), and find \( k \) by suspending known masses from the spring and using \( k = mg / \Delta L \) (where \( \Delta L \) is extension). Substitute into \( \alpha = \text{gradient} / (B N \sqrt{k/m}) \), ensuring consistent SI units.  

Key safety precautions include wearing safety goggles to shield against snapping springs or flying magnet fragments. Maintain a fixed vertical separation between the coil and the magnet's equilibrium position throughout trials. Verify spring integrity by checking its unstretched length before each measurement. To enhance accuracy, average \( E \) over three or more oscillations per \( x \) value, using slow-motion video analysis if oscilloscope resolution is insufficient. Optimize \( E \) by centering the coil under the magnet's equilibrium position and calibrating the Hall probe via bidirectional averaging. Control environmental factors like drafts, and ensure the ruler remains plumb using a spirit level. For \( k \), take multiple extension measurements across loads to plot a force-extension graph, using its gradient for improved precision."
5,"1 A student investigates the vertical oscillations of a solid cylinder which floats in cooking oil. Fig. 1.1 shows a cylinder of radius \( r \).  
\[  
\begin{array}{c}  
\text{cylinder}  
\end{array}  
\]  
Fig. 1.1  
The student places the cylinder of mass \( m \) in the oil. The cylinder is displaced vertically from its equilibrium position and released so that it oscillates. The period \( T \) of the oscillations is determined.  
A number of cylinders of different mass are available.  
It is suggested that the relationship between \( T \) and \( m \) is  
\[  
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{\sigma K r^2}}  
\]  
where \( \sigma \) is the density of the oil and \( K \) is a constant.  
Design a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \( T \) and \( m \).  
Explain how your results could be used to determine a value for \( K \).  
You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to:  
- the procedure to be followed  
- the measurements to be taken  
- the control of variables  
- the analysis of the data  
- any safety precautions to be taken.","In this experiment, the independent variable is the mass of the cylinder \( m \), which will be varied by selecting cylinders of different masses, while the dependent variable is the period of oscillation \( T \). The radius of the cylinder \( r \) and the density of the cooking oil \( \sigma \) must be kept constant throughout the experiment, as these are parameters in the suggested relationship that could otherwise affect the period.

The mass \( m \) of each cylinder is measured using a top-pan balance, recording values to the nearest 0.1 gram for precision. The radius \( r \) is determined by measuring the diameter at several points along the cylinder using a micrometer screw gauge, which provides accuracy to 0.01 mm, and then halving the average diameter to obtain \( r \). The density \( \sigma \) of the oil is measured once using a density bottle or by calculating from mass and volume measurements, ensuring the same oil batch is used at constant room temperature to maintain consistency. To measure \( T \), a large beaker filled with cooking oil is placed on a stable bench, and the cylinder is gently lowered into the oil until it floats vertically. The cylinder is displaced vertically by approximately 1 cm from its equilibrium position and released to initiate oscillations. The time for 10 complete oscillations is measured using a digital stopwatch, started and stopped as the cylinder passes a fiducial mark aligned with the equilibrium position. This timing process is repeated three times for each cylinder, and \( T \) is calculated by dividing the average time by 10. (DIAGRAM: A beaker containing cooking oil, with a cylinder floating partially submerged. A fiducial mark is drawn on the side of the beaker at the equilibrium level of the cylinder. A stopwatch is shown nearby, and a micrometer is placed beside the beaker for measuring diameter.)

To analyze the data, the equation \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{\sigma K r^2}} \) is rearranged by squaring both sides, yielding \( T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{\sigma K r^2} m \). This indicates that \( T^2 \) is proportional to \( m \), so a graph of \( T^2 \) (on the y-axis) against \( m \) (on the x-axis) should produce a straight line through the origin if the relationship is valid. The gradient of this line is \( \frac{4\pi^2}{\sigma K r^2} \), from which \( K \) is calculated as \( K = \frac{4\pi^2}{\text{gradient} \times \sigma r^2} \).

Safety precautions include wearing nitrile gloves to prevent skin contact with the oil, which could cause irritation or slippage, and placing the beaker inside a shallow tray to contain spills. To enhance accuracy, the period measurement is improved by timing 10 oscillations (rather than one) to reduce percentage error in stopwatch reaction time, and repeating this three times for each mass to allow averaging of \( T \). The fiducial mark ensures consistent counting of oscillations at the equilibrium point. The cylinder's diameter is measured at three different positions along its height and averaged to account for any irregularities, and \( r \) is recalculated as half this average. The oil density \( \sigma \) is maintained constant by avoiding temperature fluctuations and not replacing the oil between trials. Oscillations are allowed to stabilize for 5 seconds after release before timing begins, ensuring amplitudes are consistent. The relationship is verified if the \( T^2 \) vs \( m \) graph yields a straight line passing through the origin, with any scatter indicating experimental error or invalid assumptions."

The angle between the sheet and the bench is \(\theta\). The distance from point X to the trolley is \(d\).  
The trolley is released from rest and travels down the slope. The velocity \(v\) of the trolley at X is determined using a light gate.  

It is suggested that \(v\) is related to \(\theta\) by the relationship  
\[
mp \sin \theta - qB = \frac{mv^2}{2d}
\]  
where \(m\) is the mass of the trolley and magnet, \(B\) is the magnetic flux density between the magnet and the steel sheet, and \(p\) and \(q\) are constants.  

Plan a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \(v\) and \(\theta\).  
Draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment.  
Explain how the results could be used to determine values for \(p\) and \(q\).  

In your plan you should include:  
- the procedure to be followed  
- the measurements to be taken  
- the control of variables  
- the analysis of the data  
- any safety precautions to be taken.","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable in this experiment is the angle \(\theta\) between the steel sheet and the bench, which will be systematically varied to investigate its effect on the dependent variable, the velocity \(v\) of the trolley at point X. To ensure a valid test of the relationship, the distance \(d\) from the trolley's release point to X must remain constant throughout all trials. Additionally, the combined mass \(m\) of the trolley and attached magnet, as well as the magnetic flux density \(B\) between the magnet and steel sheet, must be rigorously controlled to prevent confounding influences on the results. Any variation in \(m\) or \(B\) would invalidate the relationship, as they appear as constants in the equation alongside \(p\) and \(q\).

**Methods of data collection**  
To measure \(\theta\), use a protractor aligned perpendicular to the bench and flush against the steel sheet for direct angle readings, ensuring the protractor's baseline is horizontal. Alternatively, measure the vertical height \(h\) and horizontal length \(l\) of the sheet's incline using a meter rule, then calculate \(\theta = \arctan(h/l)\). The velocity \(v\) at X is determined using a light gate positioned precisely at X and connected to a digital timer or data logger. Attach a narrow opaque card of known length \(L\) (e.g., 5 cm) to the trolley; as the trolley interrupts the light gate beam, the timer records the interruption time \(t\), allowing calculation of \(v = L/t\). Measure \(d\) with a meter rule from the trolley's starting position to X, ensuring the starting point is marked on the sheet for consistency. Determine \(m\) using an electronic balance (resolution 0.1 g) by weighing the trolley-magnet assembly before the experiment. Measure \(B\) with a calibrated Hall probe placed at the midpoint between the magnet and sheet, adjusting the probe's orientation for maximum reading and repeating in both directions to average out alignment errors.  
(DIAGRAM: A steel sheet inclined at angle \(\theta\) supported by a retort stand and clamp, with a trolley bearing a magnet (N-S poles labelled) positioned at the top. A light gate at X is connected to a data logger, and a protractor is shown adjacent to the sheet's pivot point. A meter rule measures \(d\) along the sheet, and a Hall probe is depicted near the magnet-steel interface.)

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the given relationship \(mp \sin \theta - qB = \frac{mv^2}{2d}\) to linear form: \(v^2 = 2dp \sin \theta - \frac{2dqB}{m}\). Plot \(v^2\) (y-axis) against \(\sin \theta\) (x-axis), which should yield a straight line if the relationship holds. The gradient of this line equals \(2dp\), so \(p = \text{gradient} / (2d)\). The y-intercept equals \(-\frac{2dqB}{m}\), allowing calculation of \(q = -\frac{m \times \text{y-intercept}}{2dB}\). For example, if the gradient is 0.45 m²s⁻² and \(d = 0.80\) m, \(p = 0.45 / (2 \times 0.80) = 0.28\) m. If the y-intercept is −0.30 m²s⁻², \(m = 0.5\) kg, \(B = 0.2\) T, and \(d = 0.80\) m, \(q = -\frac{0.5 \times (-0.30)}{2 \times 0.80 \times 0.2} = 0.47\) T⁻¹. The line will not pass through the origin due to the magnetic term \(-qB\).

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
To enhance accuracy, conduct at least three trials for each \(\theta\) and average the calculated \(v\) to mitigate random errors from timing inconsistencies. Place a sand-filled trap or cushioned block beyond X to safely arrest the trolley's motion, preventing falls that could damage equipment or cause injury; wear safety goggles during setup to protect against flying debris if the trolley derails. Maintain \(B\) constant by ensuring the magnet's orientation and distance from the sheet remain unchanged across trials, verified via periodic Hall probe checks. Use fiducial markers (e.g., painted lines) to fix the trolley's starting position and X, guaranteeing \(d\) is unaltered. When measuring \(\theta\) trigonometrically, use a spirit level to confirm the bench is horizontal and measure \(h\) and \(l\) to the nearest millimeter with a steel rule. For the Hall probe, zero it before use, take three readings at each configuration, and average them to minimize instrumental drift. Confirm the relationship's validity if the \(v^2\) vs. \(\sin \theta\) plot shows a linear trend with a negative y-intercept, as predicted by the equation's structure. Calibrate the light gate timer using a known constant-speed object to verify its accuracy before data collection."
7,"1 An electric pump is placed in a container of liquid. A model wind turbine is connected to the pump by a cable, as shown in Fig. 1.1.

The turbine is placed in moving air. As the turbine blades turn, electricity is generated and the pump pushes liquid through a vertical pipe.

The frequency of rotation of the turbine blades is \(f\). The height the liquid moves is \(h\). The mass per unit time of the liquid leaving the top of the pipe is \(Q\).

It is suggested that \(Q\) is related to \(f\) by the relationship  
\[Qgh = C + Df^3\]

Diagram","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the frequency of rotation of the turbine blades, \(f\), which will be varied systematically. The dependent variable is the mass per unit time of liquid flowing, \(Q\), which will be measured. The height \(h\) through which the liquid is pumped must be kept constant, as it appears in the relationship \(Qgh = C + Df^3\) but is not the subject of investigation.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up the apparatus with the wind turbine exposed to a controllable airflow source (e.g., a variable-speed fan) and connected via cable to the submerged electric pump. The pump must feed liquid into a vertical pipe of fixed height \(h\). Position a collection vessel (e.g., a beaker) at the pipe's outlet to capture the discharged liquid. To measure \(f\), mark one turbine blade distinctly and use a digital stopwatch to time at least 20 complete rotations; calculate frequency as \(f = N/t\), where \(N\) is the number of rotations and \(t\) is the time in seconds. To measure \(Q\), record the time \(t_q\) for which liquid is collected (e.g., 60 seconds using the stopwatch), then use a digital balance to measure the mass \(m\) of liquid collected. Calculate \(Q = m / t_q\) in kg·s⁻¹. Measure \(h\) with a vertical ruler, taking the difference between the liquid surface level in the container and the pipe's exit point. Ensure the pump remains fully submerged at a consistent depth throughout.  
(DIAGRAM: Wind turbine connected by cable to electric pump submerged in a liquid container, with a vertical pipe of height \(h\) attached; a variable-speed fan directed at the turbine, and a beaker on a balance collecting liquid from the pipe exit. Label fan, turbine, pump, pipe, ruler for \(h\), and balance.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Plot a graph of \(f^3\) (on the y-axis) against \(Q\) (on the x-axis). The suggested relationship \(Qgh = C + Df^3\) rearranges to \(f^3 = \frac{gh}{D} Q - \frac{C}{D}\), indicating a linear relationship where the gradient is \(\frac{gh}{D}\) and the y-intercept is \(-\frac{C}{D}\). Thus, \(D = \frac{gh}{\text{gradient}}\). Substitute \(D\) into the intercept equation to find \(C = -D \times \text{y-intercept}\). Verify the relationship if the data forms a straight line.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear safety goggles to protect against liquid splashes or displaced components, and secure all apparatus with clamps to prevent toppling. Measure \(h\) with a ruler aligned perpendicular to the bench, repeating at three points around the pipe to average any unevenness. Determine liquid mass by weighing the collection beaker empty and full, subtracting to minimize error. For accurate \(f\), use high-visibility paint for blade marking and video recording at 60 fps to count rotations frame-by-frame. Vary \(f\) by adjusting fan speed incrementally and allow 30 seconds for airflow stabilization before each measurement. Reduce uncertainty in \(Q\) by collecting liquid for ≥120 seconds and using a balance with 0.01 g resolution. Repeat each \(f\) setting three times and average \(Q\) values to account for turbulence effects. Maintain constant liquid density by using the same fluid batch and temperature, and ensure pipe internal diameter remains unchanged. Validate the relationship by confirming the graph has a non-zero y-intercept and calculate percentage differences from the line of best fit."
8,"1 Fig. 1.1 shows a thin cylindrical metal rod of length \( L \).

\( L \)

Fig. 1.1

One end of the rod is hit with a hammer. A stationary sound wave is set up within the rod. The rod vibrates at its resonant frequency \( f \).

A microphone placed at the other end of the rod detects the sound wave emitted from the rod. The frequency of the detected sound is also \( f \).

A number of rods of different length are available.

It is suggested that \( f \) is related to \( L \) by the relationship  

\[
\frac{E}{2f L^{n}} = \sqrt{\rho}
\]

where \( \rho \) is the density of the metal, and \( E \) and \( n \) are constants.  

Plan a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between \( f \) and \( L \).  

Draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment.  

Explain how the results could be used to determine values for \( E \) and \( n \).  

In your plan you should include:  
• the procedure to be followed  
• the measurements to be taken  
• the control of variables  
• the analysis of the data  
• any safety precautions to be taken.","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the length \( L \) of the metal rod, which will be systematically varied, and the dependent variable is the resonant frequency \( f \) of the sound wave produced. The density \( \rho \) of the metal must be kept constant throughout the experiment, requiring all rods to be made of identical material to ensure consistent composition and avoid variations in \( \rho \) that could affect the relationship.

**Methods of data collection**  
Support the rod horizontally using elastic bands or thin string suspended from a clamp attached to a retort stand, ensuring minimal damping. Measure \( L \) with a metre rule, aligning the rule parallel to the rod and recording the distance between the ends to the nearest millimetre. Determine the mass \( m \) of each rod using a digital balance, placing the rod centrally on the pan for accurate readings. To measure \( f \), strike one end of the rod sharply with a rubber mallet to induce vibration, and position a microphone 2–3 cm from the other end to detect emitted sound waves, avoiding physical contact. Connect the microphone to an oscilloscope set to trigger mode; observe the waveform and use the time-base controls to display at least three complete cycles. Calculate \( f \) by measuring the period \( T \) (time for one cycle) from peak-to-peak divisions and applying \( f = \frac{1}{T} \). For each \( L \), conduct three trials, striking the rod consistently to ensure repeatability.  
(DIAGRAM: A cylindrical rod suspended horizontally by strings from a clamp on a retort stand; a microphone near one end connected to an oscilloscope; a metre rule aligned beside the rod for measuring \( L \); a rubber mallet shown striking the opposite end.)

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the given equation \( \frac{E}{2f L^{n}} = \sqrt{\rho} \) to isolate \( f \):  
\[
f = \frac{E}{2 \sqrt{\rho}} \cdot L^{-n}
\]  
Take base-10 logarithms of both sides:  
\[
\log f = \log \left( \frac{E}{2 \sqrt{\rho}} \right) - n \log L
\]  
Plot \( \log f \) on the y-axis against \( \log L \) on the x-axis. The gradient of the resulting straight line equals \( -n \), so \( n = -\text{gradient} \). The y-intercept is \( \log \left( \frac{E}{2 \sqrt{\rho}} \right) \). Denoting the intercept as \( c \):  
\[
c = \log \left( \frac{E}{2 \sqrt{\rho}} \right) \implies \frac{E}{2 \sqrt{\rho}} = 10^{c} \implies E = 2 \sqrt{\rho} \times 10^{c}
\]  
First calculate \( \rho \) from one rod’s mass and dimensions, then use it with \( c \) to determine \( E \). The linearity of the graph validates the relationship.

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Secure rods firmly to prevent slipping or falling; place a sand-filled tray beneath the setup to catch rods, reducing injury risk from accidental drops. Measure the rod’s diameter \( d \) at multiple points along its length using a micrometer screw gauge, repeating at three positions (e.g., both ends and middle) and averaging to account for irregularities. Calculate density \( \rho \) from \( \rho = \frac{4m}{\pi d^{2} L} \) for a single rod, assuming uniform material, and use this value for all rods. Conduct experiments in a quiet room to minimise background noise interference with the microphone. Maintain a 2 cm gap between the rod and microphone to avoid collisions during vibration. Reduce measurement uncertainties by using longer rods (e.g., >0.5 m) to lower \( f \), facilitating clearer oscilloscope traces; adjust the time-base to expand the waveform for precise \( T \) readings. Repeat frequency measurements three times per rod and average the results. Validate the relationship by confirming a straight-line graph of \( \log f \) versus \( \log L \). Wear safety goggles to protect eyes from metal fragments if a rod fractures. Ensure the retort stand base is weighted for stability."
9,"1 It is useful to know how the speed of an object is affected by its size when it moves through liquid in a confined space. In a laboratory this can be modelled by dropping small steel balls through oil.  

It is suggested that the terminal velocity \(v\) is related to the radius \(r\) of a steel ball by the equation  
\[v = kr^2\]  
where \(k\) is a constant.  

Design a laboratory experiment to investigate whether \(v\) is related to \(r\) as indicated in the above equation. You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) how the radius of the steel ball would be measured,  
(c) how the terminal velocity of the steel ball in oil would be measured,  
(d) the control of variables,  
(e) how the data would be analysed,  
(f) any safety precautions that you would take.  
[15]  

Diagram","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the radius \(r\) of the steel ball, which will be systematically varied. The dependent variable is the terminal velocity \(v\) of the ball in oil. Temperature must be controlled and kept constant throughout the experiment, as it affects oil viscosity and thus terminal velocity. The density of the oil, the vertical distance over which velocity is measured, and the material of the balls (steel) must also remain unchanged.  

**Methods of data collection**  
To measure \(r\), use a micrometer screw gauge with a resolution of 0.01 mm. Record the diameter of each steel ball at three different orientations (e.g., mutually perpendicular axes), calculate the mean diameter, and divide by two to obtain the radius. For \(v\), fill a tall, transparent cylinder (e.g., 1 m height, 10 cm diameter) with clear oil and allow it to stand for 24 hours to eliminate air bubbles. Create two fiducial marks: the first mark positioned ≥20 cm below the oil surface to ensure the ball reaches terminal velocity before measurement, and the second mark a fixed vertical distance \(s\) (e.g., 50.0 cm) below the first. Release each ball gently at the oil surface using tweezers. Measure the time \(t\) taken for the ball to travel between the two marks with a stopwatch (±0.01 s resolution). Calculate \(v\) using \(v = s / t\), where \(s\) is measured with a meter rule (±1 mm resolution).  
(DIAGRAM: A tall glass cylinder filled with oil, clamped vertically. Two horizontal lines labelled ""start mark"" (well below surface) and ""end mark"" separated by distance \(s\). A steel ball falling between marks, with a stopwatch shown nearby.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Plot a graph of \(v\) (y-axis) against \(r^2\) (x-axis). The suggested relationship \(v = kr^2\) implies direct proportionality. If valid, the graph will yield a straight line through the origin. The constant \(k\) is the gradient of this line, calculated via \(k = \Delta v / \Delta r^2\). For verification, use all data points to plot the line of best fit and check for a y-intercept statistically indistinguishable from zero.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear nitrile gloves and a lab coat to prevent skin contact with oil, which may cause irritation, and immediately clean spills with absorbent material to avoid slips. Use a retort stand and clamps to secure the cylinder vertically, minimizing edge effects. Repeat timing measurements ≥5 times per ball radius to reduce random errors, discarding anomalies before averaging \(t\). Employ a magnet wrapped in plastic to retrieve balls without contaminating oil. Maintain oil temperature stability by conducting experiments away from drafts and using a water bath if necessary. Verify terminal velocity by confirming consistent timings over shorter intervals within \(s\). Use a wide cylinder (e.g., 10× ball diameter) to reduce wall effects, and ensure balls are clean/dry to prevent oil contamination. Measure \(s\) from the center of the start mark to the center of the end mark to reduce parallax."
10,"1 A student wishes to measure the resistivity of glass. A teacher suggests that its resistivity is of the order of \(10^6 \ \Omega\ \text{m}\) which is very large.

Resistivity \(\rho\) is defined by the equation  
\[
\rho = \frac{RA}{l}
\]  
where \(R\) is resistance, \(A\) is cross-sectional area and \(l\) is the length of the material.  

The student is given a number of sheets of glass of the same thickness and of different areas.  

Design a laboratory experiment to determine the resistivity of glass. You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) how the glass would be connected to the circuit,  
(c) the measurements that would be taken,  
(d) the control of variables,  
(e) how the data would be analysed,  
(f) any safety precautions that you would take.  

Diagram","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the cross-sectional area \(A\) of the glass sheets, varied using sheets of different sizes. The dependent variable is the electrical resistance \(R\) of each sheet. The thickness \(l\) of all glass sheets must be kept constant and identical, as provided. Temperature must be rigorously controlled throughout the experiment to prevent thermal variations from altering resistivity.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Construct a circuit with an Extra High Tension (EHT) power supply capable of outputting >1000 V, connected in series with a microammeter (to measure small currents) and the glass sample. Attach a voltmeter in parallel across the glass to measure potential difference. Each glass sheet is sandwiched between two metal electrodes (e.g., aluminum foil) covering the entire surface area to ensure uniform current distribution; secure the assembly with insulated clamps or weights. Measure the thickness \(l\) of one representative sheet using a micrometer screw gauge, taking readings at five different points and averaging to confirm uniformity (assume all sheets share this thickness). For area \(A\), measure the length and width of each sheet with a ruler, repeating each dimension three times and averaging, then calculate \(A\) as length × width. For resistance \(R\), apply voltage \(V\) via the EHT supply, record the steady current \(I\) using the microammeter, and compute \(R = V/I\). Alternatively, use a calibrated high-resistance ohmmeter directly.  
(DIAGRAM: Circuit showing EHT supply connected to metal electrodes compressing a glass sheet, with voltmeter parallel to the glass and microammeter in series. Ruler measuring sheet dimensions and micrometer measuring thickness are depicted nearby.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Plot \(R\) (y-axis) against \(1/A\) (x-axis). The equation \(\rho = R A / l\) rearranges to \(R = \rho l \cdot (1/A)\), confirming \(R \propto 1/A\). A straight-line graph through the origin validates this relationship. The gradient \(m\) equals \(\rho l\). Since \(l\) is known, calculate resistivity \(\rho = m / l\). For a 0.01 m thick sheet, a gradient of \(10^4  \Omega  \text{m}^2\) gives \(\rho = (10^4) / 0.01 = 10^6  \Omega  \text{m}\), matching the estimate.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear insulated gloves when handling the EHT supply and thick gloves for glass to prevent cuts. Switch off the EHT before adjusting contacts to avoid electric shock. Improve accuracy by: (1) Using a fiducial marker to align electrodes exactly to sheet edges, ensuring full coverage without overlap. (2) Cleaning glass with ethanol to remove contaminants affecting conductivity. (3) Averaging \(R\) from three voltage sweeps (e.g., 500 V, 1000 V, 1500 V) per sheet to minimize error, ensuring temperature stability by allowing cooling between runs. (4) Confirming contact quality by checking for linear \(V\)-\(I\) curves at fixed \(A\). (5) Using a digital storage oscilloscope to detect leakage currents, with null adjustments. (6) Performing measurements rapidly to avoid Joule heating. The linearity of \(R\) versus \(1/A\) confirms the resistivity model."

The independent variable is the overhanging length \(l\) of the wooden rule, which will be systematically varied. The dependent variable is the period of oscillation \(T\), measured for each \(l\). The mass of the load \(M\), the width \(w\) of the rule, and the thickness \(d\) of the rule must be kept constant throughout the experiment, as these parameters influence the constant \(k\) in the given equation.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Clamp one end of the wooden rule firmly to a bench using a G-clamp, ensuring the rule extends horizontally. Attach a load of known mass \(M\) to the free end. Measure \(M\) using an electronic balance with a precision of 0.1 g. Determine \(w\) and \(d\) using a vernier caliper, taking readings at multiple points along the rule and averaging to account for irregularities; \(d\) requires high precision due to its cubic dependence in the equation. Set \(l\) using a meter rule, measuring from the clamped edge to the centre of the load. For each \(l\), displace the rule vertically by a small amplitude (≤5°), release, and time at least 20 complete oscillations with a stopwatch to calculate \(T\) (period = total time / number of oscillations). Repeat timing trials three times per \(l\) to average random errors.

Linearise the equation \(T^2 = \frac{k l^3}{E}\) by recognising that \(k = \frac{16\pi^2 M}{w d^3}\), giving \(T^2 = \left( \frac{16\pi^2 M}{w d^3 E} \right) l^3\). The gradient of the straight line equals \(\frac{16\pi^2 M}{w d^3 E}\). Rearrange to solve for \(E\): \(E = \frac{16\pi^2 M}{w d^3 \times \text{gradient}}\). Verify linearity through the origin to confirm the relationship.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Use a sand tray or cushioned mat beneath the load to prevent damage or injury if the rule fractures or the load detaches. Employ the same rule throughout to maintain constant \(w\) and \(d\). Repeat measurements of \(w\) and \(d\) at five positions along the rule using the vernier caliper, averaging to mitigate local variations. Attach a reflective marker to the load and use a motion sensor connected to data-logging software for automated, high-resolution timing of oscillations, reducing human reaction error. Restrict oscillations to small amplitudes (visually confirmed via a protractor) to ensure the equation's validity for simple harmonic motion. Secure the load with adhesive putty to prevent slippage during oscillations. Select a load mass (e.g., 200 g) that yields periods >0.5 s for measurable timing. Begin timing after three initial oscillations to allow steady-state motion, using a fiducial marker at the equilibrium position for consistent cycle counting."
12,"1 A hammer is often used to force a nail into wood. The faster the hammer moves, the deeper the nail moves into the wood.  
This can be represented in a laboratory by a mass falling vertically onto a nail.  
It is suggested that the depth \(d\) of the nail in the wood (see Fig. 1.1) is related to the velocity \(v\) of the mass at the instant it hits the nail by the equation  
\[d = kv^n\]  
where \(k\) and \(n\) are constants.  

Design a laboratory experiment to investigate the relationship between \(v\) and \(d\) so as to determine a value for \(n\). You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) the measurements to be taken,  
(c) the control of variables,  
(d) the analysis of the data,  
(e) the safety precautions to be taken.  

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the velocity \(v\) of the mass at the instant it strikes the nail, which will be systematically varied, and the dependent variable is the depth \(d\) to which the nail penetrates the wood, which will be measured for each corresponding \(v\). The mass of the falling object must be held constant throughout the experiment to ensure it does not influence the relationship between \(v\) and \(d\). Additionally, the type of wood and the specifications of the nails used—such as material, dimensions, and tip geometry—must be kept identical for all trials to eliminate variability in the wood's resistance or the nail's penetration characteristics.  

**Methods of data collection**  
To vary \(v\), adjust the height \(h\) from which the mass is released vertically above the nail; higher release heights yield greater velocities upon impact. Measure \(h\) using a vertically fixed metre rule with millimetre graduations, ensuring the rule is perpendicular to the bench and aligned with the drop point. The velocity \(v\) is calculated using the equation \(v = \sqrt{2gh}\), where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), derived from energy conservation principles. Position the nail vertically at the centre of a wooden block, secured with a clamp stand, and use a set square to verify its perpendicularity before each trial. Release the mass from rest at height \(h\), allowing it to fall freely onto the nail head. After impact, measure the depth \(d\) by subtracting the exposed length of the nail above the wood surface from its original total length; use vernier callipers with a resolution of 0.1 mm to measure both the original nail length and the protruding portion, placing the calliper jaws perpendicular to the wood surface for accuracy. To ensure the mass strikes centrally, employ a transparent plastic tube as a guide for the falling mass, fixed vertically above the nail.  
(DIAGRAM: A clamp stand holding a wooden block with a vertical nail; a vertical metre rule alongside; a release mechanism for the mass (e.g., an electromagnet) at height \(h\); a transparent guide tube above the nail; vernier callipers measuring the nail's exposed length post-impact.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
To linearize the relationship \(d = kv^n\), take natural logarithms of both sides, yielding \(\ln d = n \ln v + \ln k\). Plot a graph of \(\ln d\) on the y-axis against \(\ln v\) on the x-axis using the collected data. If the relationship is valid, the data points will approximate a straight line. Perform linear regression to determine the gradient of the best-fit line, which equals the constant \(n\). The y-intercept corresponds to \(\ln k\), so \(k = e^{\text{y-intercept}}\).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Conduct three or more trials for each height \(h\) to obtain an average \(d\), reducing random errors from inconsistencies in wood grain or minor misalignments. Use a new, identical section of wood for each unique \(h\) test to prevent cumulative weakening from prior impacts, rotating the block or using fresh surfaces. Employ thin nails and soft wood (e.g., balsa) to amplify \(d\) for measurable results, confirmed via preliminary tests ensuring nails do not fully embed. For safety, place the apparatus in a sand-filled tray to arrest the falling mass after impact, and wear safety goggles to protect eyes from wood splinters or flying debris. Secure the wooden block firmly to the bench with G-clamps to prevent movement during impacts, and ensure the area is clear of personnel during drops. Calibrate the vernier callipers against a known standard before measurements to maintain precision, and record \(h\) from the base of the mass to the nail head to minimise parallax error."
13,"1 A current in a flat circular coil produces a magnetic field.  
A student suggests that the strength \( B \) of the magnetic field is related to the distance \( x \) from the centre of the coil (see Fig. 1.1) by the equation  
\[ B = B_0 e^{-px} \]  
where \( B_0 \) is the strength of the magnetic field for \( x = 0 \), and \( p \) is a constant.  

Design a laboratory experiment that uses a Hall probe to investigate the relationship between \( B \) and \( x \). You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment.  
In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) the measurements to be taken,  
(c) the control of variables,  
(d) the analysis of the data,  
(e) the safety precautions to be taken.","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable in this experiment is the distance \(x\) from the centre of the coil, which will be systematically varied, while the dependent variable is the magnetic flux density \(B\), measured using a Hall probe. To isolate the relationship between \(x\) and \(B\), several variables must be held constant: the current flowing through the coil, the radius of the coil, and the number of turns in the coil. These controls ensure that any changes in \(B\) are solely due to variations in \(x\), as alterations in current, coil dimensions, or turn count could independently influence the magnetic field strength.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up the flat circular coil on a non-magnetic surface, connecting it to a regulated DC power supply capable of maintaining a steady current. Use a ruler or vernier caliper to measure \(x\) along the coil's axis with millimetre precision, ensuring the zero point (\(x = 0\)) is identified by aligning the Hall probe at the geometric centre of the coil using visual symmetry or a laser pointer. Position the Hall probe perpendicular to the magnetic field lines at each \(x\) location, verified using a set square to ensure consistent right-angle alignment, and rotate the probe slightly to maximize its voltage output, indicating optimal orientation. Record the Hall probe's voltage output, which is proportional to \(B\), using a digital multimeter or data logger. For each \(x\), measure \(B\) at least three times and average to reduce random errors.  
(DIAGRAM: Coil mounted horizontally with power supply leads; Hall probe attached to a movable ruler aligned along the coil’s central axis; set square ensuring probe perpendicularity; multimeter displaying voltage.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Transform the proposed equation \(B = B_0 e^{-px}\) by taking natural logarithms: \(\ln B = \ln B_0 - px\). This linearizes the relationship, allowing \(\ln B\) to be plotted on the y-axis against \(x\) on the x-axis. If the equation is valid, this graph will yield a straight line. The gradient of this line corresponds to \(-p\), so \(p = -\text{gradient}\). The y-intercept equals \(\ln B_0\), thus \(B_0 = e^{\text{y-intercept}}\). Calculate \(p\) and \(B_0\) using linear regression, and verify the relationship by checking the linearity of the plotted data points.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
The relationship is validated if the \(\ln B\) versus \(x\) graph produces a straight line. To enhance accuracy, generate a stronger magnetic field by increasing the coil's turns or using a higher current (e.g., 5 A), monitored with an ammeter in series to ensure current constancy. Stabilize the Hall probe’s orientation by fixing it to a ruler with adhesive or mounting it on an optical bench to prevent tilt. Calibrate the Hall probe beforehand in a known magnetic field (e.g., Earth’s field) to establish voltage-to-\(B\) conversion. Minimize external magnetic interference by conducting the experiment away from electronic devices or ferromagnetic materials. Repeat measurements with the Hall probe reversed at each \(x\) and average results to cancel zero-error offsets. For safety, avoid prolonged coil operation by switching off the power supply between readings to prevent overheating, and handle the coil with insulated gloves if currents exceed 3 A to mitigate thermal burns."
14,"1 When light is incident on the front of a photocell, an e.m.f. is generated in the photocell.  
A student wishes to investigate the effect of adding various thicknesses of glass in front of a photocell. This may be carried out in the laboratory by varying the number of identical thin glass sheets between a light source and the front of the photocell.  
It is suggested that the e.m.f. \(V\) is related to the number \(n\) of glass sheets by the equation

[15]","In this experiment, the number of glass sheets \(n\) is the independent variable to be varied, and the e.m.f. \(V\) generated by the photocell is the dependent variable to be measured. The distance between the light source and the photocell must remain constant throughout the investigation to ensure that changes in \(V\) are solely due to variations in \(n\). Additionally, the intensity of the light source must be held constant, achieved by maintaining a fixed voltage across the lamp or a steady current through it, preventing fluctuations in illumination that could affect \(V\).

The apparatus is arranged with a light source, such as a filament lamp, positioned in a straight line with the stack of glass sheets and the photocell. A digital voltmeter is connected directly to the photocell terminals to measure the e.m.f. \(V\) accurately. For each glass sheet, the thickness \(t\) is measured using a micrometer screw gauge, ensuring high precision by taking readings at multiple points (e.g., center and edges) and calculating the average to account for variations. The experiment is conducted in a dark room or within a light-tight enclosure to eliminate interference from ambient light. The procedure involves setting \(n = 0\) (no sheets) and recording \(V\), then incrementally adding identical glass sheets (e.g., \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\)) and measuring \(V\) for each \(n\). Between trials, the glass sheets are cleaned to remove dust or fingerprints that could scatter light.  
(DIAGRAM: A lamp connected to a stabilized power supply, followed by a vertical stack of glass sheets, then a photocell aligned perpendicularly to the light path, and a voltmeter attached to the photocell; the entire setup is enclosed in a black box to block stray light.)

To analyze the data, take the natural logarithm of each \(V\) value to obtain \(\ln V\). Plot \(\ln V\) on the y-axis against \(n\) on the x-axis. According to the equation \(V = V_0 e^{-\alpha n t}\), linearization yields \(\ln V = \ln V_0 - \alpha t n\). The graph should produce a straight line with a negative gradient. The absorption coefficient \(\alpha\) is calculated as \(\alpha = -\text{gradient} / t\), where the gradient is determined from the line of best fit using linear regression, and \(t\) is the average thickness of one glass sheet obtained earlier.

Safety precautions include wearing safety goggles when handling glass sheets to protect against cuts from sharp edges and using heat-resistant gloves when adjusting the lamp to prevent burns from hot surfaces. Additional details: First, maintain a small fixed distance (e.g., 20 cm) between the lamp and photocell to maximize \(V\) readings for sensitivity. Second, ensure light intensity stability by powering the lamp with a constant-voltage supply and monitoring the voltage with a voltmeter or the current with an ammeter; include a variable resistor in series to fine-tune and lock the current. Third, align all glass sheets perpendicular to the light beam to minimize reflective losses and ensure consistent absorption. Fourth, repeat each \(n\) measurement three times and average \(V\) to reduce random errors. Fifth, verify the linear form \(\ln V = -\alpha t n + \ln V_0\), where the y-intercept corresponds to \(\ln V_0\), confirming consistency with the theoretical model."
15,"1 A student wishes to investigate projectile motion.

A small ball is rolled with velocity \( v \) along a horizontal surface. When the ball reaches the end of the horizontal surface, it falls and lands on a lower horizontal surface. The vertical displacement of the ball is \( p \) and the horizontal displacement of the ball is \( q \), as shown in Fig. 1.1.

It is suggested that  
\( gq^2 = 2pv^2 \)  
where \( g \) is the acceleration of free fall.

Design a laboratory experiment to investigate how \( q \) is related to \( p \) and how \( v \) may be determined from the results. You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) the measurements to be taken,  
(c) the control of variables,  
(d) the analysis of the data,  
(e) the safety precautions to be taken.  

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The vertical displacement \( p \) is the independent variable and will be deliberately varied, while the horizontal displacement \( q \) is the dependent variable and will be measured for each corresponding \( p \). The horizontal velocity \( v \) of the ball at the point of projection must be kept strictly constant throughout the experiment. Additionally, the acceleration due to gravity \( g \) is a fixed constant at the laboratory location and requires no active control, but environmental factors like air resistance should be minimized.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up a horizontal track elevated above a lower horizontal surface, using adjustable supports (e.g., lab jack or stackable blocks) to vary the vertical displacement \( p \). Ensure both surfaces are level using a spirit level, checking at multiple points. Release the ball from a fixed starting point on a curved ramp section to guarantee a consistent horizontal velocity \( v \) upon exit; verify the launch angle is 90° using a set square aligned vertically at the track's edge. Measure \( p \) with a meter rule held vertically from the lower surface to the track's exit point, recording values in metres. For each launch, determine \( q \) by allowing the ball to land on carbon paper overlaid on white paper fixed to the lower surface, creating a visible mark; measure \( q \) horizontally from the plumb-line-marked exit point below the track to the mark's centre using a millimetre ruler. Use a light gate at the track exit to monitor launch velocity consistency, but do not record \( v \) directly as it will be derived from analysis.  
(DIAGRAM: Adjustable-height track with curved end, spirit level on lower surface, plumb line marking exit point, carbon paper landing zone, set square at track edge, and meter rule measuring \( p \) vertically.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the equation \( gq^2 = 2pv^2 \) to \( q^2 = \left(\frac{2v^2}{g}\right)p \). Plot \( q^2 \) (y-axis) against \( p \) (x-axis), which should yield a straight line through the origin if the relationship holds. Calculate the gradient \( m \) of this line via linear regression. Substitute into \( v = \sqrt{\frac{g \times m}{2}} \) to determine \( v \), where \( g \) is the local gravitational acceleration (e.g., 9.81 m·s⁻²). For validation, a straight-line fit with intercept near zero confirms proportionality between \( q^2 \) and \( p \).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Place a deep sand-filled tray around the landing surface to safely contain the ball and prevent rolling hazards, with safety goggles worn by all participants to protect against ricochets. Ensure \( v \) remains constant by repeating launches three times per \( p \) and averaging \( q \), reducing random errors. Minimize air resistance effects by using a smooth, high-density steel ball bearing. Define \( q \)'s origin precisely via a plumb line suspended from the track's edge, and measure \( p \) from the lower surface to the ball's centre at launch. Validate horizontal projection using slow-motion video analysis with a calibrated scale beside the track, cross-referencing exit angle and velocity consistency. Confirm the relationship through a linear origin-passing trend in the \( q^2\)-vs-\(p \) graph, with deviations indicating systematic errors like incline misalignment."
16,"1 A fairground ride carries passengers in chairs which are attached by metal rods to a rotating central pole, as shown in Fig 1.1. When the pole rotates with angular velocity \( \omega \), the rods make an angle \( \theta \) to the vertical.  

It is suggested that \( \cos \theta \) is inversely proportional to \( \omega^2 \).  

Design a laboratory experiment, using a small object to represent an occupied chair, to test the relationship between \( \theta \) and \( \omega \). You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to

(b) the measurements to be taken,  
(c) the control of variables,

(e) the safety precautions to be taken.","The independent variable in this experiment is the angular velocity ω, which is varied by changing the rotation rate of the central pole, while the dependent variable is the angle θ made by the rod with the vertical. The angular velocity is derived from frequency f (using ω = 2πf) or period T (using ω = 2π/T). The length of the rigid rod must be kept constant throughout the experiment to isolate the relationship between θ and ω.  

A small object representing the chair is attached to a rigid rod connected to a central pole rotated by a variable-speed motor. The motor's speed is adjusted using a variable power supply to achieve different angular velocities. The frequency or period is measured using a stopwatch to time multiple rotations (e.g., timing 10 full rotations and dividing by 10 to get T, then calculating ω = 2π/T), with a fiducial marker ensuring consistent starting/ending points for timing. The angle θ is measured using a large protractor fixed to the central pole, aligned to read the angle directly when the rod is in motion, or by measuring the vertical height h from the pivot to the object and the rod length l with a ruler, then calculating cos θ = h/l.  
(DIAGRAM: Central vertical pole driven by a motor, with a rigid rod extending horizontally to a small object. A large protractor is fixed to the pole at the pivot, a fiducial marker aligns with the object's path, and a variable power supply controls the motor.)  

To analyze the data, calculate cos θ and 1/ω² for each trial. Plot a graph of cos θ (y-axis) against 1/ω² (x-axis). If the suggested relationship holds, the data will form a straight line passing through the origin, confirming that cos θ is inversely proportional to ω².  

Safety requires a protective screen around the apparatus to contain the object if it detaches. Use a motor capable of high speeds to produce measurable angles, and secure the protractor firmly to the pole for clear readings. Measure h and l accurately with a ruler to 1 mm precision, ensuring the object's center is referenced. Verify the pole's vertical alignment with a spirit level before each test. Time at least 10 rotations per trial and average three repetitions to reduce errors. Allow the system to stabilize at constant speed before measurements, and consider video recording with slow-motion playback to capture θ at the fiducial marker precisely."

Alternatively, use a tachometer or light gate system aligned perpendicular to the object's motion to record frequency directly. For \(\theta\), fix a large protractor to the pole with its zero aligned vertically and read \(\theta\) visually when rotation stabilizes, or measure the vertical height \(h\) from the pivot to the object with a ruler and use \(\cos \theta = h/l\), where \(l\) is the rod length measured precisely with a ruler. Use a fiducial marker (e.g., a pointer) at a reference point to synchronise timing.

18,"1 A student is investigating the flow of water through a horizontal tube.  
The rate \( Q \) (volume per unit time) at which water flows through a tube depends on the pressure difference per unit length across the tube.

The level of water in the can is kept constant by the position of a wide vertical tube which passes through the hole in the bottom of the can as shown in Fig. 1.1. Both tubes may be moved along the holes.

The independent variable is the vertical height \( h \), which will be systematically varied. The dependent variable is the flow rate \( Q \), measured as the volume of water collected per unit time. The length of the narrow horizontal tube \( l \), its internal diameter \( d \), the density of water \( \rho \), and the acceleration due to gravity \( g \) must be kept constant.

The independent variable is the radius \(r\) of the ball, which will be systematically varied using balls of different sizes. The dependent variable is the period \(T\) of the oscillations, measured for each ball. The radius of curvature \(C\) of the track must be held constant throughout the experiment by maintaining an identical track shape and support configuration. Additionally, the material and density of the balls must be controlled to ensure consistent rotational inertia, and environmental factors like air resistance should be minimised by conducting trials in still air.

Measure the diameter of each ball using a micrometer screw gauge: place the ball between the anvil and spindle, rotate the thimble until contact is made without compression, and read the scale to the nearest 0.01 mm. Calculate the radius \(r\) as half the average of three diameter measurements taken at different orientations. To measure \(T\), release the ball from rest at a fiducial marker (e.g., a pencil line) at the track's lowest point, and time at least 10 complete oscillations with a digital stopwatch (±0.01 s resolution). Repeat the timing three times per ball, ensuring consistent amplitude by releasing from the marker. Calculate \(T\) by dividing total time by the number of oscillations.

The position of the small mass on the plate must be kept constant throughout the experiment to ensure consistent conditions; this is achieved by marking a fixed location on the plate where the mass is always placed. Additionally, the same small mass must be used for all trials to avoid introducing variability from mass differences, and the plate must be maintained in a horizontal orientation using a spirit level to prevent gravitational effects from influencing the point of contact loss.  

To collect data, first set up the apparatus by connecting a signal generator to the electric vibrator to supply an alternating current, and attach a cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO) in parallel with the vibrator to measure the peak potential difference and frequency. Place the small mass at a predetermined, marked position on the plate. For a chosen \(V\), adjust the signal generator's amplitude control to set the peak voltage, which is verified by measuring the peak-to-peak voltage on the CRO screen—calculated as the vertical deflection in divisions multiplied by the Y-gain setting—and halving this value to obtain \(V\) in volts. Gradually increase the frequency from the signal generator while observing the mass-plate interface, and record the frequency \(f\) when contact is lost, identified by a visible gap or audible rattling. Measure \(f\) directly from the signal generator's display if calibrated, or determine the period \(T\) from the CRO by measuring the horizontal distance for one complete waveform cycle in divisions and multiplying by the time-base setting, then calculate \(f = 1/T\) in hertz. Repeat this process for the same \(V\) at least three times to obtain an average \(f\), and repeat across a range of \(V\) values (e.g., 5–10 distinct values). (DIAGRAM: An electric vibrator fixed to a bench with a horizontal metal plate on top; a small mass centered on the plate. A signal generator is connected via leads to the vibrator. A CRO is connected in parallel across the vibrator. Labels indicate the vibrator, plate, mass, signal generator, and CRO.)  

For analysis, rearrange the suggested equation \(k = \pi^2 f^2 V\) to \(f^2 = (k / \pi^2) \times (1 / V)\). Plot a graph of \(f^2\) on the y-axis against \(1/V\) on the x-axis. If the relationship is valid, this will yield a straight line through the origin. Calculate the gradient of the best-fit line using linear regression. The constant \(k\) is then determined from the gradient \(m\) using \(k = \pi^2 \times m\). For instance, if the gradient is 0.15 Vs², then \(k = \pi^2 \times 0.15 \approx 1.48\).  

Safety precautions include wearing safety goggles to protect eyes from the small mass if it is ejected, and positioning a safety screen or soft sand tray around the apparatus to contain any flying debris. Additional details involve allowing time for the vibrator to stabilize at each new \(V\) setting before measurements to ensure steady oscillations, and verifying \(f\) by both increasing and decreasing frequency near the threshold to refine the loss-of-contact point. The mass and plate surfaces should be cleaned with alcohol to remove dust or oils that could affect friction. When using the CRO, measure the waveform period \(T\) by averaging multiple cycles for accuracy, and calibrate the Y-gain and time-base settings beforehand. The linear graph's validity is confirmed if it passes through the origin, indicating direct proportionality between \(f^2\) and \(1/V\). To minimize error, use a strobe light for visual verification of contact loss and average \(f\) over five trials per \(V\)."

An alternating potential difference (p.d.) is applied to the vibrator. For a given peak p.d. \(V\), there is a maximum frequency \(f\) at which the small mass remains in contact with the plate. The contact between the small mass and plate is lost when the frequency is greater than \(f\).

The independent variable is the peak potential difference \(V\) applied to the vibrator, which is systematically varied. The dependent variable is the maximum frequency \(f\) at which the small mass maintains contact with the plate. Variables to be controlled include the position of the mass on the plate (to ensure consistent vibrational coupling), the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity that might affect friction), and the horizontality of the plate (to prevent gravitational bias).  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up the electric vibrator on a stable surface, ensuring the metal plate is horizontal using a spirit level.

Apply an alternating p.d. and set a specific \(V\) using the signal generator's amplitude control, verified via the CRO's amplitude measurement (peak voltage = peak-to-peak reading × 0.5 × y-gain setting). Gradually increase the frequency \(f\) (adjusted via the signal generator) until the mass loses contact, detected by visual observation of a gap or auditory cues (e.g., rattling). Record \(f\) directly from the signal generator's display or calculate it from the CRO by measuring the period \(T\) (time for one oscillation = division count × time-base setting) and applying \(f = 1/T\). Repeat this process for at least five values of \(V\), conducting three trials per \(V\) to average \(f\) and reduce random errors.

If the relationship holds, the graph yields a straight line through the origin. Calculate the gradient \(m\) of the best-fit line using linear regression. The constant \(k = \pi^2 \times m\).

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear safety goggles to shield eyes from potential projectile ejection of the mass. Ensure the vibrator oscillates steadily before each measurement by allowing 10–15 seconds for stabilization after adjusting \(f\) or \(V\). Measure \(V\) accurately via the CRO: calibrate the y-gain using a known voltage, and use the average of three amplitude readings. Clean the plate and mass surfaces with ethanol to remove debris, ensuring consistent friction. Verify plate horizontality with a spirit level before each trial. The relationship is validated if the plotted data forms a straight line through the origin. To minimize systematic error, determine \(f\) by both increasing and decreasing \(f\) near the loss-of-contact threshold and averaging the results. Use a non-slip mat under the vibrator to dampen vibrations and improve stability."

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The wavelength \( \lambda \) of light emitted by each LED serves as the independent variable, which will be systematically varied across different LEDs. The dependent variable is the minimum potential difference \( V \) required across the LED for it to emit light. No other variables require explicit control beyond those intrinsic to each LED, as \( k \) and \( n \) are universal constants for the relationship.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Construct a series circuit comprising a variable DC power supply, a protective resistor (e.g., 330 Ω to limit current), and the LED—ensuring correct polarity (anode connected to the positive terminal). Connect a digital voltmeter in parallel across the LED to measure \( V \) in volts (V). Use the power supply or a potentiometer to adjust the potential difference incrementally. For each LED, increase \( V \) slowly from zero until the LED emits light, detected visually in a darkened room or using a light-dependent resistor (LDR) positioned near the LED; the voltmeter reading at this threshold is recorded as \( V \). The wavelength \( \lambda \) (in nm) for each LED is obtained from the manufacturer’s datasheet or measured experimentally: using a diffraction grating, direct a collimated beam from the LED onto the grating, measure the angle \( \theta \) to the first-order maximum with a protractor, and calculate \( \lambda = d \sin\theta \), where \( d \) is the grating spacing. Repeat \( V \) measurements three times per LED for averaging.  
(DIAGRAM: A circuit with a variable power supply, series protective resistor, LED (symbol shown with anode and cathode), and parallel voltmeter; for wavelength measurement, an LED illuminates a diffraction grating, with a screen and protractor to measure \( \theta \).)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Linearize the equation \( V = k\lambda^n \) by taking base-10 logarithms:  
\[ \log V = n \log \lambda + \log k \]  
Plot \( \log V \) (y-axis) against \( \log \lambda \) (x-axis) for all LEDs. If the relationship holds, the data will form a straight line. The gradient of the line of best fit equals the constant \( n \). The y-intercept corresponds to \( \log k \), so \( k = 10^{\text{y-intercept}} \).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
The relationship is valid if the \( \log V \) vs. \( \log \lambda \) graph yields a straight line. Average three \( V \) readings per LED to reduce random errors. Always include a protective resistor to prevent LED damage from overcurrent, typically chosen to limit current to 20 mA. Conduct trials in a dark room to enhance detection sensitivity for the lighting threshold. For experimental \( \lambda \) determination, use a laser of known wavelength to calibrate the grating spacing \( d \) via \( d = \lambda_{\text{laser}} / \sin\theta_{\text{laser}} \). Verify LED polarity using a datasheet to avoid reverse-bias damage. Safety measures include inspecting wiring for insulation defects to prevent electric shocks and avoiding prolonged direct viewing of bright LEDs to protect eyesight. If using a datasheet for \( \lambda \), cross-reference multiple sources to confirm accuracy. Maintain consistent ambient temperature during trials, as \( V \) can decrease with heating due to reduced bandgap energy. For grating setups, repeat angle measurements and average to minimize parallax errors."

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the wavelength λ of light emitted by each LED, which is determined by selecting different LEDs with known or measurable wavelengths. The dependent variable is the minimum potential difference V required for the LED to emit light. There are no explicit control variables beyond the intrinsic properties of each LED, as the relationship is tested across distinct LEDs rather than by varying λ for a single LED.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Construct a series circuit comprising a direct current power supply, a protective resistor (e.g., 100 Ω to limit current), and the LED, ensuring correct polarity (anode connected to positive supply). Include a voltmeter in parallel across the LED to measure V. Use a variable power supply or a potentiometer to adjust the potential difference smoothly. For each LED, gradually increase the p.d. from zero while monitoring light emission. The exact onset of emission is detected using a light-dependent resistor (LDR) positioned near the LED; when the LDR's resistance drops sharply (measured via an ammeter in series with the LDR and a fixed voltage source), record V from the voltmeter. Wavelength λ is obtained either from manufacturer datasheets or experimentally using a diffraction grating: direct the LED's light through the grating, measure the angle θ of the first-order maximum with a protractor, and calculate λ = d sin θ, where d is the grating spacing (e.g., 500 lines/mm gives d = 2 × 10⁻⁶ m). Repeat V measurements three times per LED and average.  
(DIAGRAM: Circuit with DC power supply, protective resistor, LED (correct symbol with anode labeled), parallel voltmeter, and LDR-detector system; diffraction grating setup with protractor for λ measurement.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Take base-10 logarithms of the equation V = kλⁿ to yield lg V = lg k + n lg λ. Plot lg V on the y-axis against lg λ on the x-axis. If the relationship holds, the data will form a straight line. The gradient of the line of best fit equals the constant n. The y-intercept corresponds to lg k, so k = 10^(y-intercept). For example, if the y-intercept is c, then k = 10ᶜ.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Include a protective resistor in the circuit to limit current and prevent LED damage, reducing burn risk. Work in a darkened room or enclose the LED and detector in a light-tight tube to eliminate ambient light interference, ensuring accurate detection of emission onset. Verify LED polarity to avoid reverse bias damage. For experimental λ determination, calibrate the diffraction grating using a laser of known wavelength and measure θ precisely by aligning the grating normal to the light beam. When using the LDR, connect it to a separate circuit with a battery and ammeter, noting the threshold current drop indicating emission. The relationship is validated if the log-log graph yields a straight line. Average three V readings per LED to mitigate random errors from human reaction time or detector sensitivity. For safety, wear insulated gloves when handling high-voltage supplies and avoid direct eye exposure to bright LEDs."

Measure \(m\) and \(B\) using a digital top-pan balance with a precision of 0.1 g. Mark points \(P\) (release point) and \(Q\) (measurement point) on the plane, and determine \(s\) using a metre rule with millimetre resolution, ensuring \(s\) remains fixed. Adjust \(\theta\) by altering the plane's height, and measure \(\theta\) with a protractor aligned perpendicular to the horizontal; alternatively, use the metre rule to measure the vertical height \(h\) and horizontal base length \(l\) of the incline, then compute \(\sin \theta = h/l\). Position a light gate at \(Q\) connected to a digital timer or data logger. Affix a narrow opaque card of length \(L = 0.100 \, \text{m}\) (measured with vernier calipers) to the block.

Fix \(s\) by etching marks at \(P\) and \(Q\) on the plane and aligning the block edge with \(P\) using a fiducial marker. Prevent plane slippage by clamping its base or adding non-slip mats. Minimize friction by polishing the block and plane surfaces, and ensure the string is lightweight and inextensible. For \(\sin \theta\), use trigonometry (\(\sin \theta = h/l\)) with \(h\) and \(l\) measured to ±1 mm, averaging three readings.

Charge sphere S by briefly connecting it to the positive terminal of a high-tension power supply using an insulated lead, then disconnect. Similarly, charge sphere T to a specific voltage \(V\), measured using a digital voltmeter connected across the power supply terminals. The force \(F\) is derived from the difference in balance readings when both spheres are charged versus uncharged: \(F = (\text{charged reading} - \text{uncharged reading}) \times g\), where \(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\). Measure \(r\) by first determining the diameter of each sphere using a micrometer caliper (recording values to 0.01 mm), then calculating the gap between their surfaces with a ruler (resolution 1 mm), and finally summing the radii and the gap for center-to-center distance.

Charge sphere T by briefly connecting it to a high-voltage power supply set to a specific \( V \), measured using a voltmeter connected across the supply terminals. For each trial, record the balance reading with both spheres uncharged, then recharge T to the same \( V \), and record the new balance reading with S charged. The force \( F \) is calculated as the difference in these readings multiplied by \( g \), expressed as \( F = \Delta m \times g \), where \( \Delta m \) is the change in mass reading. To ensure constant charge on S, charge it once at the start using a separate power supply and avoid recharging it during the experiment. (DIAGRAM: Sphere T suspended by insulating thread from a clamp stand, sphere S on a top-pan balance directly below; a ruler positioned horizontally between the spheres to measure \( r \); a high-voltage power supply with voltmeter connected, and a lead for charging T.)

To analyze the data, plot a graph of \( F \) (on the y-axis) against \( V \) (on the x-axis). The suggested relationship \( F = \alpha V / r^2 \) implies direct proportionality, so if the graph yields a straight line passing through the origin, the relationship is validated. The constant \( \alpha \) is determined from the gradient \( m \) of the best-fit line using the equation \( \alpha = m \times r^2 \), where \( r \) is the constant separation distance measured earlier.

For accuracy and safety, first discharge spheres after each trial by touching them with an earthed metal rod to prevent accidental shocks from high voltages. Place an insulating block (e.g., polystyrene) between sphere S and the balance pan to prevent charge leakage. Measure the diameter of each sphere using a micrometer caliper, then halve and sum the radii to adjust \( r \) accurately as the center-to-center distance. Conduct at least three trials for each \( V \) and average the \( F \) values to minimize random errors. Perform measurements swiftly after charging to reduce charge dissipation, and enclose the setup to block air currents that could displace sphere T. Calibrate the top-pan balance to zero before readings and verify that the charge on S remains unchanged by monitoring its initial balance reading consistency. Wear insulating gloves when handling charged spheres or power supplies to mitigate electric shock risks."
30,"1 A student is investigating the bending of a loaded wooden strip. Fig. 1.1 shows a rectangular strip of width \( b \) and thickness \( t \) overhanging the edge of a bench. A length \( L \) of the strip is unsupported.  

A load of mass \( M \) is positioned at point P. This causes the unsupported part of the strip to bend with a deflection \( s \), as shown in Fig. 1.2.  

It is suggested that the relationship between \( s \) and \( L \) is  
\[

The independent variable is the unsupported length \( L \), which will be systematically varied, and the dependent variable is the deflection \( s \) at point P. The variables to be controlled are the mass \( M \) of the load, the width \( b \) of the wooden strip, the thickness \( t \) of the strip, the material properties (hence Young modulus \( E \) remains constant), and environmental factors affecting \( g \), which is constant at the laboratory location.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Securely clamp one end of the wooden strip to the bench using a G-clamp, ensuring the strip is horizontal and aligned perpendicular to the bench edge. Attach a load of mass \( M \) precisely at point P using a hook or adhesive. Measure \( M \) to the nearest 0.1 g using an electronic balance. Measure the width \( b \) with a millimetre ruler, taking readings at three points along the strip and averaging. Measure thickness \( t \) using a micrometer screw gauge, recording values at multiple positions along the strip and averaging to account for variations. For each selected \( L \), measure from the clamped edge to point P using a ruler fixed parallel to the strip. To measure deflection \( s \), clamp a vertical ruler adjacent to point P and use a set square to ensure perpendicularity. Record the initial vertical position of point P without load, then apply \( M \) and wait for equilibrium. Measure the new position and calculate \( s \) as the difference between loaded and unloaded positions. Repeat deflection measurements three times for each \( L \) and average.

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the equation to \( s = \left( \frac{4Mg}{E b t^3} \right) L^3 \). Plot \( s \) on the y-axis against \( L^3 \) on the x-axis. If the relationship is valid, data will form a straight line through the origin. Calculate the gradient \( k \) of this line using linear regression. Substitute into \( k = \frac{4Mg}{E b t^3} \) and solve for \( E \): \( E = \frac{4Mg}{b t^3 k} \). Use \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m·s}^{-2} \), with \( M \), \( b \), and \( t^3 \) from measurements.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear safety goggles to protect against snapping wood or falling loads, and place a sand tray beneath the setup to catch dropped masses. Use the same strip throughout to maintain constant \( b \), \( t \), and \( E \). Clamp the vertical ruler firmly and verify alignment with a plumb line to avoid parallax errors. Measure \( s \) as the displacement from the unloaded position to account for initial curvature. Average three \( s \) readings per \( L \) to reduce random errors. Measure \( t \) with a micrometer at five points, discarding outliers before averaging, as thickness variation significantly impacts \( t^3 \). Check strip perpendicularity by measuring \( L \) from both edges and adjusting until equal. Allow 30 seconds after loading before measuring \( s \) to ensure static equilibrium and minimize creep effects."

Calculate \( s \) as the difference between loaded and unloaded ruler readings at \( P \) to eliminate zero-error. For each \( L \), conduct three trials: remove and reapply the load, then average \( s \) to reduce random errors. Measure \( t \) with a micrometer at multiple strip locations, repeating for \( b \) with a ruler, and average to account for material inhomogeneity. Align the strip perpendicular to the bench using a set square, confirming consistent \( L \) by measuring from both strip edges.

- any safety precautions to be taken.","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the cross-sectional area \(A\) of the spring, which will be varied by constructing springs with different coil diameters. The dependent variable is the spring constant \(k\). To isolate the relationship, the number of turns \(N\) must be held constant across all springs. Additionally, the wire thickness \(t\) and the density of the metal \(\rho\) must be controlled, as they appear in the equation but are not under investigation.  

**Methods of data collection**  
To measure \(k\), suspend the spring vertically from a fixed clamp attached to a retort stand. Attach a mass holder to the free end and measure the mass \(m\) of each load using a top-pan balance with a precision of at least 0.1 g. Calculate the force \(F = mg\), where \(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\). Measure the extension \(x\) using a vertically clamped ruler with millimeter graduations: record the initial position of a marker on the spring with no load, then apply the load and record the new position. The extension is the difference between these positions. For each spring, use at least three different masses to measure multiple extensions. Measure the wire thickness \(t\) using a micrometer screw gauge, taking readings at three points along the wire and averaging. Determine the mean diameter \(D\) of the spring coil using calipers, measuring at multiple orientations and averaging. Calculate \(A = \pi D^2 / 4\). Ensure \(N\) is identical for all springs by counting turns during construction. Measure \(\rho\) by cutting a straight wire sample of length \(L\), measuring its mass with a balance, and calculating volume \(V = \pi (t/2)^2 L\), so \(\rho = \text{mass} / V\).  
(DIAGRAM: A spring suspended from a retort stand clamp, with a mass holder attached. A vertical ruler is clamped parallel to the spring, with a marker indicating the measurement point. Calipers measure the spring's diameter, and a micrometer measures wire thickness.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the equation to \(k = \left( \beta \rho t^4 / N \right) \times (1/A^2)\). Plot \(k\) on the y-axis against \(1/A^2\) on the x-axis. If the relationship holds, this yields a straight line through the origin. The gradient equals \(\beta \rho t^4 / N\). Thus, \(\beta = (\text{gradient} \times N) / (\rho t^4)\). Verify linearity by ensuring the correlation coefficient exceeds 0.99.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear safety goggles to protect against snapping wires or falling masses, and place a cushion beneath the setup to catch dropped loads. Ensure the ruler is perfectly vertical using a set square against the bench, reducing parallax error. For each spring, measure extensions for multiple masses and plot \(F\) vs. \(x\); the gradient gives \(k\), improving accuracy over single measurements. Repeat wire thickness measurements at different wire segments and average to account for manufacturing variations. Determine \(D\) by subtracting wire thickness \(t\) from the external coil diameter, measured at both ends and mid-coil, then average. Calculate \(\rho\) as described earlier to avoid reliance on literature values. Clamp springs firmly to prevent slippage, and pre-load each spring with a small mass to remove initial slack before measuring extensions."

The relationship is valid if a straight line through the origin is obtained. The gradient equals \( \frac{\beta \rho t^4}{3N} \), so \( \beta = \frac{3N \times \text{gradient}}{\rho t^4} \). Alternatively, plot \( \lg k \) against \( \lg A \), which should yield a straight line with gradient −2.

The independent variable is the resistance \(R\), which will be varied by selecting different unmarked resistors. The dependent variable is the time \(t\) for the current in the resistor to reach its maximum value after closing the switch.

**Methods of data collection**  
Construct a series circuit comprising the high-voltage d.c. power supply, a switch, the coil, and one of the unmarked resistors. To measure \(R\) for each resistor, disconnect it from the circuit and use a digital ohmmeter to record its resistance directly, ensuring no residual charge affects the reading. For the coil, measure its length \(L\) using vernier calipers, taking readings at multiple points along its axis and averaging to account for irregularities. To determine the cross-sectional area \(A\), measure the coil's diameter \(d\) at several orientations using a micrometer screw gauge, calculate \(A = \pi (d/2)^2\) for each measurement, and average the results. To measure \(t\), connect an oscilloscope across the resistor to monitor the voltage (proportional to current). Set the oscilloscope to trigger on the rising edge when the switch is closed, with a time base of 1 ms/division. Determine \(t\) as the time interval from the voltage jump (switch closure) to when the voltage stabilizes at its maximum. Repeat this for at least five different resistors to generate a range of \(R\) values.

Plot a graph of \(t\) (y-axis) against \(1/R\) (x-axis). The suggested equation \(t = \frac{KN^2A}{LR}\) rearranges to \(t = \left(\frac{KN^2A}{L}\right) \frac{1}{R}\), indicating that \(t\) is proportional to \(1/R\). If the relationship is valid, the graph will yield a straight line passing through the origin. The gradient of this line equals \(\frac{KN^2A}{L}\). To determine \(K\), rearrange to \(K = \frac{\text{gradient} \times L}{N^2 A}\), substituting the measured values of \(L\), \(N\), and \(A\).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Safety precautions are critical due to the high-voltage supply: always open the switch and disconnect the power supply before handling resistors or components, and wear insulated gloves to prevent electric shock. Control variables rigorously: use a single coil to fix \(N\), \(A\), and \(L\); verify \(L\) with vernier calipers at three positions and average, and confirm \(A\) by repeating diameter measurements at both ends and the middle of the coil to detect tapering. For accuracy, measure \(t\) three times for each \(R\) and average, ensuring the oscilloscope time base is calibrated and triggered consistently. To extend \(t\) into a measurable range (milliseconds), select lower \(R\) values to increase the time constant, or if necessary, use a coil with greater \(N\) or \(A\) (though \(N\), \(A\), and \(L\) must remain fixed once chosen). When measuring \(R\), zero the ohmmeter and avoid contact with leads to prevent parallax errors. The relationship is validated if the \(t\) vs. \(1/R\) graph is linear with a y-intercept at zero; systematic deviations may indicate unaccounted resistance or inductance effects."

Maintain \(A\) constant by securing the coil to prevent deformation and remeasuring its diameter if disturbed. Measure \(L\) with vernier calipers at three positions, ensuring the coil is straight on a flat surface, and average the readings. Control \(N\) by using the same coil throughout and avoiding unwinding. Use an oscilloscope’s cursor function to precisely determine \(t\) from the voltage-time graph, noting the time from the initial rise to the plateau. If \(t\) is too short for resolution, select a coil with greater \(N\) or \(A\) during setup to increase the time constant, though \(L\) must remain fixed once measurements begin.

Measure \( d \) with a digital micrometer screw gauge, taking readings at multiple points across the plates and averaging to account for unevenness, with values recorded in meters. Determine \( A \) by measuring the length and breadth of the overlapping plate area using a precision ruler (e.g., 0.5 mm resolution), calculating \( A = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \) in square meters. Charge the plates by connecting them to a high-voltage DC power supply (e.g., 1000 V) via a switch, ensuring the supply is disconnected before linking the uncharged capacitor. Connect the capacitor to the plates and measure \( V \) using a high-impedance digital voltmeter in parallel with the capacitor, selecting an appropriate range (e.g., 200 V full scale) to minimize loading errors. The capacitance \( C \) of the capacitor is measured beforehand using a calibrated capacitance meter.  
(DIAGRAM: Two parallel plates supported by insulating spacers on a non-conductive base, connected via a switch to a capacitor and a voltmeter; a power supply with a second switch for charging; a ruler aligned to measure plate dimensions, and a micrometer adjusting the separation.)  

For analysis, compute \( \frac{1}{V} \) for each \( d \) value and plot \( \frac{1}{V} \) (y-axis) against \( d \) (x-axis). If the relationship is valid, the data will form a straight line. Perform linear regression to determine the gradient \( m \) and y-intercept \( c \). Calculate \( K \) using \( K = \frac{C \times c}{m \times A} \), where \( C \) is the measured capacitance and \( A \) is the constant plate area. Determine \( W \) from \( W = \frac{1}{c} \), derived from the y-intercept. The constants \( K \) and \( W \) are thus quantified using the graph's parameters.  

Wear insulated gloves and safety goggles when handling high-voltage components to prevent electric shocks, and discharge the capacitor fully between trials using a 10 kΩ resistor across its terminals for safe dissipation. Maintain the initial charge on the plates constant by using identical power supply settings and charging duration for all trials, monitored with a voltmeter during charging. Measure \( C \) using a calibrated capacitance meter before the experiment, cross-checking with a standard capacitor if available. Incorporate a double-pole switch to isolate the power supply during discharge, reducing accidental contact risks. Repeat \( V \) measurements at least three times for each \( d \) and average the results to reduce random errors, similarly averaging multiple \( d \) measurements per configuration. Support plates on acrylic stands to prevent charge leakage, and use a high-voltage supply (e.g., 1000 V) with a low-capacitance capacitor (e.g., 1 μF) to enhance measurement sensitivity. Validate the relationship by confirming linearity in the graph of \( \frac{1}{V} \) against \( d \), with residuals indicating conformity to the proposed equation."

The independent variable is the separation distance \( d \) between the parallel metal plates, which will be deliberately varied. The dependent variable is the potential difference \( V \) across the uncharged capacitor connected to the plates, which will be measured. The area \( A \) of the plates must be kept constant throughout the experiment, as it is the only other variable in the equation that is not being manipulated or measured as the dependent variable.  

**Methods of data collection**  
To measure \( d \), use a micrometer screw gauge or digital calipers, ensuring measurements are taken in millimeters with an uncertainty of ±0.01 mm. Position the calipers perpendicular to the plates, recording the separation at multiple points (e.g., center and corners) for each configuration. For \( A \), measure the length and breadth of one plate using a millimeter-graduated ruler, calculating \( A \) as the product of these dimensions in m². The capacitance \( C \) of the uncharged capacitor must be determined beforehand using a separate procedure: discharge the capacitor through a known resistor \( R \) and measure the time constant \( \tau \) from a voltage-time decay curve using a data logger, then calculate \( C = \tau / R \).  

To collect data, construct a circuit where the charged plates are connected to the uncharged capacitor via a switch. Charge the plates initially using a high-voltage DC power supply (e.g., 1000 V) set to a fixed voltage, ensuring the power supply is disconnected before measurements. Connect a digital voltmeter in parallel with the capacitor to record \( V \) with an uncertainty of ±0.1 V. For each \( d \), close the switch to allow charge sharing, then record the stabilized \( V \) reading. Ensure the plates remain parallel by using non-conductive spacers of measured thickness.  
(DIAGRAM: A circuit showing two parallel metal plates connected to a DC power supply via a charging switch, and to a capacitor and voltmeter via a separate discharge switch; the plates are separated by adjustable spacers with a ruler and calipers nearby for measurement.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the given equation \( \frac{W}{Cd} = 1 + \frac{V}{KA} \) to linearize it for plotting:  
\[
\frac{1}{V} = \left( \frac{K}{C} \right) d + \frac{1}{W}
\]  
Plot \( \frac{1}{V} \) on the y-axis against \( d \) on the x-axis. The gradient of the resulting straight line is \( \frac{K}{C} \), and the y-intercept is \( \frac{1}{W} \). Calculate \( K \) as the product of the gradient and \( C \), so \( K = \text{gradient} \times C \). Calculate \( W \) as the reciprocal of the y-intercept, so \( W = \frac{1}{\text{y-intercept}} \). If the data forms a straight line, it validates the relationship, though it will not pass through the origin due to the y-intercept term.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear insulated gloves and safety goggles to prevent electric shocks, especially when using high-voltage supplies or handling charged plates. Ensure all equipment is grounded, and avoid touching exposed conductors. Maintain the initial charge on the plates constant by using the same power supply voltage for all trials and verifying it with a voltmeter before each run. Improve accuracy by averaging three or more \( V \) readings for each \( d \), and repeat \( d \) measurements at different plate positions to account for uneven separation. Use a two-switch circuit: one to charge the plates from the power supply and another to connect them to the capacitor, minimizing accidental discharges. Fully discharge the capacitor between trials by short-circuiting it with a resistor or using a discharge switch. Support the plates on an insulated surface to prevent charge leakage, and employ a high-impedance voltmeter to reduce current draw. If \( V \) readings are small, increase the initial plate voltage or use a capacitor with lower \( C \) to amplify the signal. The relationship is confirmed if the plot shows a straight line with a non-zero y-intercept."

Diagram","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the angle θ between the inclined plane and the horizontal surface, which will be systematically varied. The dependent variable is the time t taken for the cylinder to fall a fixed distance d. Variables to be controlled include the distance d, the mass of the wooden cube A, the mass of the cylinder B, and environmental factors such as friction in the pulley and air resistance, which should be minimized to ensure they do not significantly influence the results.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up the inclined plane on a horizontal bench, supporting it with an adjustable stand to vary θ. Attach the wooden cube (mass A) to the cylinder (mass B) via a string passing over a pulley fixed at the plane's apex. Measure d, the vertical fall distance of the cylinder, using a metre ruler clamped vertically beside the cylinder’s path or by marking d directly on a ruler affixed to the setup. Measure θ with a protractor aligned between the plane and horizontal surface, or by determining sinθ trigonometrically (e.g., measure the plane’s height h and length l with a ruler, then calculate sinθ = h/l). Measure t using a digital stopwatch: start timing upon cylinder release from rest and stop when it reaches d. For higher accuracy, use two light gates at the start and end of d, connected to a timer that records t when the cylinder interrupts both beams. Masses A and B are measured once using a top-pan balance (e.g., 0–500 g range, ±0.01 g precision) and kept unchanged.  
(DIAGRAM: Inclined plane on horizontal bench, supported by adjustable stand. Pulley at top edge, string connecting cube on plane to hanging cylinder. Vertical ruler beside cylinder, protractor at plane base. Light gates at cylinder start/end positions if used.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Rearrange the given equation to linear form:  
\[
\frac{2d}{t^2} = \frac{A H \sin \theta - K A}{A + B}  
\]  
Multiplying both sides by \(A + B\) and dividing by A gives:  
\[
\frac{2d(A + B)}{A t^2} = H \sin \theta - K  
\]  
Thus, \( \frac{1}{t^2} \) is proportional to \( \sin \theta \). Plot \( \frac{1}{t^2} \) (y-axis) against \( \sin \theta \) (x-axis). The gradient is \( \frac{A H}{2d(A + B)} \), so \( H = \frac{2d(A + B)}{A} \times \text{gradient} \). The y-intercept is \( -\frac{A K}{2d(A + B)} \), so \( K = -\frac{2d(A + B)}{A} \times \text{y-intercept} \). Use linear regression to find gradient and intercept, then solve for H and K.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Place a cushioned box or sand tray beneath the cylinder to safely arrest its fall, preventing damage or injury. Ensure the protractor is firmly secured at the plane’s base to avoid parallax errors when reading θ. Keep masses A and B constant by verifying them with the balance before each θ trial. For accurate t, use light gates with interrupt cards on the cylinder, ensuring gates are perpendicular to motion and aligned with d’s start/end points. Release the cylinder using an electromagnet or manual trigger to ensure consistent initial conditions without imparting force. Maintain constant d by marking start/end positions on the vertical ruler and resetting the cylinder precisely. Increase d (e.g., >0.5 m) to extend t, reducing timing errors. Repeat t measurements ≥3 times per θ and average to mitigate random errors. The relationship is valid if the graph yields a straight line with non-zero intercept. Lubricate the pulley axle to minimize friction, and conduct trials in a draft-free area to limit air resistance effects. Ensure the bench is stable and clutter-free to prevent tripping hazards."

The independent variable is time \( t \) after cooling begins, and the dependent variable is the cylinder's surface temperature \( T_C \). The room temperature \( T_R \) must be held constant. Additionally, the cylinder's physical properties—mass \( m \), length \( L \), diameter \( d \), and specific heat capacity \( c \)—must remain unchanged, as they influence the constants \( U \) and \( Z \). The insulation thickness must also be controlled to maintain consistent heat transfer conditions.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Heat the cylinder uniformly in an oven at a fixed temperature (e.g., 80°C) for 15 minutes to ensure thermal equilibrium. Using tongs, wrap it immediately in a fixed thickness of fiberglass insulation, ensuring no gaps. Insert a calibrated thermocouple through the insulation to contact the cylinder's surface, connected to a data logger. Start the data logger and stopwatch simultaneously upon placing the cylinder in the room. Record \( T_C \) at 30-second intervals for 30 minutes, and \( T_R \) using a separate thermometer placed 1 m away. Measure \( m \) with a 0.01 g precision balance.

Measure \( d \) with a micrometer screw gauge (resolution 0.01 mm) at five positions along the cylinder, rotating between measurements, and average the values. For \( c \), conduct a separate experiment: wrap the cylinder in an insulated heating coil, pass a known current \( I \) (measured via ammeter) for time \( t \) while measuring voltage \( V \) (voltmeter), and record temperature change \( \Delta\theta \) with a thermometer; then \( c = \frac{VIt}{m\Delta\theta} \).

42,"1 Double glazing can be used for sound insulation. Double-glazed windows consist of two panes of glass with air in the space between them. Manufacturers reduce the air pressure in the space between the panes of glass to reduce the amplitude of sound transmitted through the window.  

It is suggested that the amplitude \(A\) of sound transmitted through a double-glazed window is related to the air pressure \(p\) in the space between the panes by the equation  
\[
A = k p

where \(k\) is a constant.  

Fig. 1.1 shows a laboratory model of a double-glazed window. It consists of two panes of glass. There is a tube connected to the space between the two panes so that air may be removed.

Diagram","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the air pressure \(p\) (in pascals) between the panes, which will be systematically reduced. The dependent variable is the amplitude \(A\) of the transmitted sound wave. The incident sound amplitude (controlled by the source output), the frequency of the sound, the temperature of the air, and the geometric arrangement (distances between source, window, and detector) must be kept constant to isolate the effect of \(p\) on \(A\).  

**Methods of data collection**  
Connect a vacuum pump to the tube between the panes to reduce \(p\). Measure \(p\) using a calibrated Bourdon gauge or digital pressure gauge attached to the tube, ensuring readings are taken once pressure stabilizes. Generate sound using a signal generator and loudspeaker set to a fixed frequency (e.g., 1 kHz) and incident amplitude. Place a microphone perpendicular to the window on the opposite side to detect transmitted sound. Connect the microphone to an oscilloscope; measure \(A\) as half the peak-to-peak voltage (in volts) of the waveform, which is proportional to displacement amplitude. Conduct the experiment in a quiet, foam-lined room to minimize reflections.

To test \(A = k \sqrt{p}\) (implying \(A^2 \propto p\)), plot \(A^2\) (y-axis) against \(p\) (x-axis). If the relationship holds, the graph will yield a straight line through the origin. The constant \(k\) is determined from the gradient \(m\) as \(k = \sqrt{m}\). Alternatively, plot \(\lg A\) against \(\lg p\); a linear fit with gradient 0.5 confirms the relationship, where \(k = 10^{c}\) (with \(c\) as the y-intercept).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Ensure incident amplitude stability by monitoring the source waveform with a second oscilloscope and microphone. Maintain fixed frequency using the signal generator’s readout. Minimize reflections by lining walls with acoustic foam and positioning the microphone within 5 cm of the window. Control temperature by conducting trials in a climate-controlled room or allowing equilibration time after pressure changes. Wear ear defenders to prevent hearing damage from prolonged loud sound exposure, and use safety goggles to shield against potential glass implosion from low pressure. Average three amplitude readings per pressure to reduce random error. Calibrate the pressure gauge against a known standard before use.

The control variables are the intensity of the light source (maintained by a constant power supply) and the alignment of the LDR relative to the light source (ensuring perpendicular incidence of light on the LDR surface to avoid angular variations).  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up the light source (e.g., a 12V filament lamp) on an optical bench, powered by a stabilised DC power supply to maintain constant intensity. Position the LDR on the same bench, aligned coaxially with the light source using clamps to ensure consistent orientation. Measure the distance \(d\) from the front face of the light source to the active surface of the LDR with a millimetre-scale ruler, ensuring parallax errors are minimized by viewing perpendicularly. To measure \(R\), connect the LDR in series with a digital ammeter and a DC power supply (e.g., 5V), with a digital voltmeter in parallel across the LDR. Record the voltage \(V\) (in volts) and current \(I\) (in amperes), then calculate \(R\) using \(R = V/I\) (in ohms). Conduct all trials in a darkened room to eliminate ambient light interference. Collect data for at least eight different \(d\) values spanning the LDR's resistance range (e.g., 0.10 m to 1.00 m in 0.10 m intervals).  
(DIAGRAM: Optical bench with lamp (connected to power supply) and LDR (in series with ammeter and voltmeter), aligned coaxially; ruler fixed parallel to the bench; dark enclosure surrounding the setup.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Linearize the equation \(R = kd^n\) by taking natural logarithms: \(\ln R = \ln k + n \ln d\). Plot \(\ln R\) (y-axis) against \(\ln d\) (x-axis). If the relationship holds, the data will form a straight line. Determine the gradient \(m\) and y-intercept \(c\) via linear regression. The gradient equals \(n\), and the intercept \(c = \ln k\), so \(k = e^c\). Verify the constants by selecting two widely separated points on the line to calculate \(m\) and \(c\) independently, ensuring consistency with the regression values.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear safety goggles to protect against intense light exposure, and avoid direct eye contact with the source. Secure all clamps to prevent equipment displacement, and allow the lamp to cool between trials to avoid overheating. Maintain alignment by mounting the LDR and lamp in fixed holders on the optical bench, with their surfaces parallel. Use a fiducial marker (e.g., engraved line) on the LDR casing to standardise the measurement point for \(d\). Monitor light source stability by recording the supply voltage before each reading; if fluctuations exceed 1%, discard the data. For high-resistance measurements (near 500 kΩ), use a high-impedance voltmeter and microammeter to ensure accuracy, and average three \(R\) readings per \(d\) to reduce random errors. Perform the experiment swiftly to minimise lamp ageing effects, and calibrate the ammeter/voltmeter with a known resistor before use. The relationship is validated if the \(\ln R\) vs. \(\ln d\) graph yields a straight line, with residuals randomly distributed about zero."

A changing e.m.f. in coil X induces an e.m.f. in coil Y.  
The student wishes to investigate how the e.m.f. \(V\) in coil Y depends on the frequency \(f\) of the current in coil X.  
It is suggested that \(V\) is directly proportional to \(f\).  

Design a laboratory experiment to investigate the suggested relationship. You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,

(c) the control of variables,  
(d) the analysis of the data,  
(e) the safety precautions to be taken.  

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
In this experiment, the frequency \(f\) of the current in coil X is the independent variable, which will be systematically varied, and the induced e.m.f. \(V\) in coil Y is the dependent variable to be measured. The current flowing through coil X must be held constant throughout the experiment to ensure that changes in \(V\) are solely due to variations in \(f\). Additionally, the physical characteristics of coil Y, specifically its number of turns and cross-sectional area, must remain unchanged to prevent any influence on the induced e.m.f. from these factors.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Set up coil X and coil Y as tightly wound, independent coils, with coil Y encircling coil X. Connect coil X to an alternating current (a.c.) power supply or signal generator, which allows precise adjustment of the input frequency \(f\). Measure \(f\) directly from the signal generator's display or, for greater accuracy, use a cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO) connected across coil X to determine the period \(T\) of the waveform and calculate \(f\) as \(f = 1/T\). Connect coil Y to a high-impedance voltmeter or the CRO to measure the induced e.m.f. \(V\); if using a CRO, quantify \(V\) by multiplying the peak-to-peak height of the waveform by the y-gain setting. To maintain a constant current in coil X, insert an ammeter in series and adjust the signal generator's output amplitude or include a rheostat in the circuit, monitoring the ammeter reading to ensure consistency at each frequency setting.  
(DIAGRAM: Coil X connected to a signal generator and series ammeter, with coil Y wound tightly around it; coil Y connected to a voltmeter or CRO. An iron core is inserted through both coils to enhance magnetic coupling.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Plot a graph of \(V\) (on the y-axis) against \(f\) (on the x-axis) using the collected data. If \(V\) is directly proportional to \(f\), as suggested, the graph will yield a straight line passing through the origin. The validity of the relationship is confirmed if the data points align closely with this linear trend, with no systematic deviations.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
The coils may become hot due to resistive heating from prolonged current flow; to mitigate this, switch off the power supply between measurements and allow cooling intervals, and handle coils with heat-resistant gloves while avoiding direct skin contact. Use an iron core inside both coils to amplify the magnetic flux and increase the induced e.m.f. for better signal detection. Employ a large current in coil X (e.g., 1–2 A) and a high number of turns on coil Y to enhance sensitivity, but ensure wires are insulated to prevent short circuits. Minimize interference from external alternating magnetic fields by conducting the experiment away from electrical equipment and shielding the setup with mu-metal if available. Verify the current constancy in coil X by recording ammeter readings at multiple frequencies and averaging results over three trials for each \(f\) to reduce random errors. Maintain the relative positions and alignment of the coils throughout to avoid variations in magnetic linkage, and secure all connections to prevent movement-induced artifacts."
45,"1 A student wishes to determine the resistivity of aluminium.

The resistivity \( \rho \) of a conductor is defined as \( \rho = \frac{RA}{l} \) for a conductor of resistance \( R \), cross-sectional area \( A \) and length \( l \).

Fig. 1.1 shows the typical dimensions of a strip of aluminium of lengths \( c \), \( d \) and \( t \). The resistivity of aluminium is about \( 10^{-8} \, \Omega\text{m} \).

\( t = 1 \, \text{mm} \)  
\( d \, 1 \, \text{cm} \)  
\( c \, 1 \, \text{m} \)

Fig. 1.1 (not to scale)

Design a laboratory experiment to determine the resistivity of aluminium using this strip. The usual apparatus of a school laboratory is available, including a metal cutter.

You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to

(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) the measurements to be taken,  
(c) the control of variables,  
(d) the analysis of the data,  
(e) the safety precautions to be taken.

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The independent variable is the length \(c\) of the aluminium strip, which will be systematically varied. The dependent variable is the electrical resistance \(R\) of the strip. The cross-sectional area \(A\) (determined by width \(d\) and thickness \(t\)) must be held constant across all measurements. Additionally, temperature must be controlled to prevent thermal expansion or resistivity changes, achieved by limiting current exposure and maintaining ambient conditions.  

**Methods of data collection**  
Cut the aluminium strip into at least five different lengths \(c\) (e.g., 0.2 m, 0.4 m, 0.6 m, 0.8 m, 1.0 m) using a metal cutter, ensuring cuts are perpendicular to the length via a set square. Measure each \(c\) with a 1 m metre rule, aligning the rule edge with the cut ends to minimise parallax error. For cross-sectional area \(A\), measure width \(d\) (≈1 cm) and thickness \(t\) (1 mm) using a micrometer screw gauge: record \(d\) and \(t\) at three positions along a reference strip, averaging to account for manufacturing variations. Calculate \(A = d \times t\) in m².  

To measure resistance \(R\), assemble a series circuit with a low-voltage DC power supply (≤5 V), analogue ammeter (0–5 A range), and aluminium strip. Connect crocodile clip electrodes to the strip’s full width at both ends to ensure uniform current distribution. Attach a digital voltmeter (0–50 mV range) in parallel across the strip. For each length, pass a constant current (e.g., 4.0 A), recording voltage \(V\) once stabilised. Calculate \(R = V/I\) for each trial. Include a 2 Ω protective resistor in series to limit current and prevent overheating.  

(DIAGRAM: Strip clamped horizontally with electrodes at ends, connected to power supply, ammeter, and protective resistor in series; voltmeter across strip. Micrometer measuring thickness, metre rule aligned along length.)  

**Method of analysis**  
Plot \(R\) (y-axis) against \(c\) (x-axis). The equation \(R = (\rho / A) \cdot c\) predicts a straight line through the origin. Perform linear regression to find gradient \(m\). Calculate resistivity via \(\rho = m \times A\), where \(A = \overline{d} \times \overline{t}\) (using averaged dimensions). Validate the relationship if the line intercepts the origin within uncertainty.  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
Wear cut-resistant gloves when handling or cutting aluminium to shield against sharp edges, and safety goggles during cutting to prevent metal fragment ingress. Insulate the strip from the work surface using polystyrene blocks to eliminate stray currents. Measure \(d\) and \(t\) at both ends and midpoint of a full-length strip, averaging three readings each to mitigate localised thinning. Repeat resistance measurements three times per length and average \(R\) to reduce random errors. Employ a rheostat to fine-tune current, ensuring voltage readings remain stable within ±0.1 mV. Estimate expected \(R\) (e.g., for \(c = 1\) m, \(A = 10^{-5}\) m², \(\rho \approx 10^{-8}\) Ωm, \(R \approx 0.001\) Ω), necessitating a high-current, low-voltage setup with millivolt-range voltmeter. After each reading, disconnect the power to minimise joule heating and stabilise temperature."
46,"1 A current-carrying coil produces a magnetic field.  
It is suggested that the strength \( B \) of the magnetic field at the centre of a flat circular coil is inversely proportional to the radius \( r \) of the coil.  
Design a laboratory experiment that uses a Hall probe to test the relationship between \( B \) and \( r \). You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment.  
In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) the measurements to be taken,  
(c) the control of variables,  
(d) the analysis of the data,  
(e) the safety precautions to be taken.  
[15]","In this experiment, the radius \( r \) of the circular coil is the independent variable, which will be deliberately varied, and the magnetic field strength \( B \) at the coil's centre is the dependent variable, to be measured using a Hall probe. The number of turns on the coil must remain constant across all trials to ensure that any changes in \( B \) are solely attributable to variations in \( r \). Additionally, the current \( I \) flowing through the coil must be maintained at a fixed value throughout the experiment, as it directly influences the magnetic field strength and could confound the results if allowed to fluctuate.  

To collect data, first set up a circuit where the coil is connected to a d.c. power supply capable of delivering a stable current, incorporating a rheostat in series to fine-tune and stabilise the current, which should be monitored continuously using an ammeter connected in series with the coil. Position the Hall probe precisely at the geometric centre of the coil by adjusting its location until the Hall voltage reading reaches a maximum, indicating alignment with the peak magnetic field; this can be facilitated by using a set square or an optical bench to ensure the probe remains perpendicular to the plane of the coil and maintains a consistent orientation. Measure the coil's radius \( r \) using vernier callipers for high accuracy, taking multiple readings (e.g., at different angular positions) and averaging to account for minor irregularities in the coil's circular shape. The Hall probe must be connected to a voltmeter or an oscilloscope to record the Hall voltage \( V_H \), which is proportional to \( B \) after calibration; this calibration involves exposing the probe to a known magnetic field and establishing a conversion factor between \( V_H \) and \( B \). For each radius setting, record \( V_H \) and compute \( B \) using the calibration factor, repeating measurements at least three times to obtain an average value of \( B \) for enhanced reliability. (DIAGRAM: A circular coil connected via wires to a d.c. power supply, rheostat, and ammeter; a Hall probe fixed centrally within the coil using a clamp stand, with its leads connected to a voltmeter; vernier callipers shown measuring the coil's diameter.)  

For analysis, plot a graph of \( B \) on the y-axis against \( 1/r \) on the x-axis. If the suggested inverse proportionality holds, the data should form a straight line passing through the origin. The gradient of this line corresponds to the constant of proportionality in the relationship \( B = k / r \), where \( k \) is expected to be invariant if the hypothesis is correct. Alternatively, a log-log graph of \( \lg B \) against \( \lg r \) can be plotted, in which case a straight line with a gradient of -1 would confirm the inverse proportionality, with the y-intercept providing \( \lg k \).  

Safety precautions include avoiding prolonged contact with the coil to prevent burns from resistive heating, especially when using high currents; always switch off the power supply between measurements to minimise heat buildup. Additional detail: Employ a large current or numerous coil turns to amplify the magnetic field, improving signal detectability. Use the rheostat meticulously to compensate for any resistance changes due to heating, ensuring current stability. Maintain the Hall probe orthogonally to the magnetic field direction using a protractor or jig to avoid angular errors. Calibrate the Hall probe beforehand in a known field, such as that of a standard solenoid, to establish the \( V_H \)-to-\( B \) relationship. For each radius, reverse the Hall probe's orientation and average the readings to cancel out any offset voltages. Repeat radius measurements at multiple points and average to mitigate coil imperfections.

[15]","**Defining the problem**  
The cross-sectional area \(A\) of coil X is the independent variable, which will be systematically varied, while the induced e.m.f. \(V\) in coil Y is the dependent variable to be measured. Variables requiring strict control include:  
1. The number of turns \(N_Y\) on coil Y, as altering this would change flux linkage.  
2. The number of turns \(N_X\) on coil X, as this affects the magnetic field strength.  
3. The alternating current \(I_X\) in coil X, since \(V \propto dI_X/dt\).  
4. The frequency \(f\) of the alternating current, because \(V \propto df/dt\) for a sinusoidal signal.  
5. The relative positioning of the coils (coil Y wound tightly around coil X to maintain consistent mutual inductance geometry).  

**Methods of data collection**  
Construct coil X by winding insulated wire around cardboard tubes of differing diameters but identical length. Wind coil Y with a fixed number of turns tightly over each tube. Connect coil X to a signal generator set to a specific frequency (e.g., 50 Hz) and monitor \(I_X\) with an a.c. ammeter in series, adjusting a rheostat to maintain constant current. Connect coil Y to a calibrated oscilloscope or a.c. voltmeter. For each tube, measure the diameter \(d\) at three points using vernier calipers, averaging to minimize error. Calculate \(A = \pi (d/2)^2\). Record the peak-to-peak voltage \(V_{pp}\) from the oscilloscope (using \(V = \text{height} \times \text{y-gain}\)) or the r.m.s. reading from the voltmeter.  
(DIAGRAM: Cardboard tube with coil X wound lengthwise, coil Y wound over it; signal generator connected to coil X via rheostat and ammeter; oscilloscope/voltmeter connected to coil Y.)  

**Methods of analysis**  
Plot a graph of \(V\) (y-axis) against \(A\) (x-axis). If \(V\) is directly proportional to \(A\), the data will form a straight line through the origin. Verify linearity by calculating the correlation coefficient or inspecting residuals. The gradient \(k = V/A\) quantifies the proportionality constant, which depends on fixed parameters like \(I_X\), \(f\), and \(N_Y\).  

**Additional detail including safety considerations**  
To enhance accuracy, use a high-frequency a.c. current (e.g., 1 kHz) to amplify induced \(V\), ensuring measurable results. Employ a digital storage oscilloscope for precise \(V_{pp}\) measurement, averaging over 10 waveform cycles. Maintain \(I_X\) constant via rheostat feedback, verified by real-time ammeter readings. Measure each diameter \(d\) perpendicularly at tube ends and midpoint, calculating \(A\) from mean \(d\). Repeat \(V\) measurements three times per tube and average. Eliminate external magnetic interference by conducting the experiment far from power cables or using a mu-metal shield. For safety, insert a fuse in series with coil X to prevent overheating, and power off the signal generator between trials to avoid coil insulation damage. Always verify coil temperatures before adjustments to prevent burns."
