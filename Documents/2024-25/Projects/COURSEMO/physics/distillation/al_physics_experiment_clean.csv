© UCLES 2007","1 It is useful to know how the speed of an object is affected by its size when it moves through liquid in a confined space. In a laboratory this can be modelled by dropping small steel balls through oil.  

It is suggested that the terminal velocity \(v\) is related to the radius \(r\) of a steel ball by the equation  
\[v = kr^2\]  
where \(k\) is a constant.  

Design a laboratory experiment to investigate whether \(v\) is related to \(r\) as indicated in the above equation. You should draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. In your account you should pay particular attention to  
(a) the procedure to be followed,  
(b) how the radius of the steel ball would be measured,  
(c) how the terminal velocity of the steel ball in oil would be measured,

7 Keep water temperature constant. [1]","A student is investigating the flow of water through a horizontal tube.

The rate \( Q \) (volume per unit time) at which water flows through a tube depends on the pressure difference per unit length across the tube.

The student has the use of a metal can with two holes. A narrow horizontal tube goes through the hole in the side of the can. The can is continuously supplied with water from a tap. The level of water in the can is kept constant by the position of a wide vertical tube which passes through the hole in the bottom of the can as shown in Fig. 1.1. Both tubes may be moved along the holes.

It is suggested that the relationship between the flow rate \( Q \) of water through the narrow horizontal tube and the vertical height \( h \) is

2. Take many readings of t or d and average.  
3. Use a protective resistor/circuit designed to reduce current.  
4. Rearrange equation to determine graph using c, d and t or A.  
5. Determine typical resistance of aluminium strip.  
6. Likely meter range of ammeter/voltmeter/ohmmeter.  
7. Detail on cutting strip e.g. mark using set square. [4]","1 A student wishes to determine the resistivity of aluminium.

The resistivity \( \rho \) of a conductor is defined as \( \rho = \frac{RA}{l} \) for a conductor of resistance \( R \), cross-sectional area \( A \) and length \( l \).

Fig. 1.1 shows the typical dimensions of a strip of aluminium of lengths \( c \), \( d \) and \( t \). The resistivity of aluminium is about \( 10^{-8} \, \Omega\text{m} \).

\( t = 1 \, \text{mm} \)  
\( d \, 1 \, \text{cm} \)  
\( c \, 1 \, \text{m} \)
