class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Price stability is a macroeconomic objective of government. It means that the government aims to maintain low and stable inflation over time. There are several other objectives of government such as sustained economic growth, maintaining a healthy balance of payments and keeping a low rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>Price stability could be the main aim of a government whose economy is facing rapid and excessive inflation. During times of excessive inflation, there are many costs which are borne by society. For example, when prices rise rapidly, businesses are reluctant to invest, as it is difficult to project for the future. If a business is preparing for an investment project, they won’t be able to accurately predict the costs of doing so nor the returns. During periods of high inflation and low price stability, businesses will suffer. In addition, consumers will suffer as their purchasing power has eroded. Their money will not buy the same amount of goods and services as it did before the rise in prices.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that focusing on price stability should be the main aim of a government who is facing rapid and sustained inflation. Depending on the severity of the inflation and its impact on society, it should be prioritized.</p>
<p>Secondly, it could be argued that economic growth should be the main aim of government. For developing countries and arguably developed economies, economic growth can be seen to be the main aim. Economic growth is measured by the rise of GDP. In fig. 1 you can see the impact of an increase in aggregate demand on real GDP and the price level. Depending on the levels of spare capacity, increases in economic growth may not have a significant impact on the price level. In addition, in fig. 2, there is an increase in aggregate supply, which drives up output but actually lowers the price level.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/d6c493a80fd8c7b5411f8dba83f30d5f" alt="" width="513" height="213"></p>
<p>The focus on rising GDP can also help decrease unemployment, maintain a healthy balance of payments and help a country become more competitive internationally. As the potential and capabilities of the economy increase, the economy will operate more efficiently. Greater opportunities will be available for the citizens of the country and it will attract foreign investment. Some inflation may be acceptable in order to pursue the objective of growth.</p>
<p>On balance, the extent to which price stability should be the main aim of an economy depends on the macroeconomic issues it is facing. If an economy has low levels of inflation and excess capacity, then it should not be a priority. In this situation, the government should focus on economic growth and lowering unemployment. However, during periods of high inflation and price instability, the government should absolutely make price stability the main aim. Dependent upon the economic conditions of the country, the priorities will change.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 2</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28189</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the view that all economic growth results in a higher price level.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Economic growth is a rise in real GDP over time. A higher price level is an increase in price throughout an economy. Not all forms of economic growth result in higher price levels.</p>
<p>Firstly, when the economy is performing at or near full capacity there is little unemployment. Many people within the economy have jobs and there is a higher level of aggregate demand. With so many people earning, a significant amount of money is circulating throughout the economy resulting in high pressure on prices. This can be seen in fig. 1 below. As aggregate demand shifts from AD to AD<sub>1</sub>, output increases from Y to Y<sub>1</sub> and the price level increases from PL to PL<sub>1</sub>. In addition, if aggregate demand continues to increase, say from AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>, then there will be no increases in output and only rises in the price level. At Y<sub>1</sub> we can say the economy is operating at full capacity, which means all resources are fully utilized.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/3cedb82a96823a9990979e1e93ff1472" alt=""></p>
<p>However, were the economy to be starting at a point along the horizontal portion of the aggregate supply curve, then it would indicate that there is significant spare capacity within the economy. This could be due to high levels of unemployment that are typically associated with a recession. If there are many people out of work, there will be significantly less pressure on prices throughout the economy. From this point, if growth develops, then there can be economic growth without an increase in the price level. This is seen in fig. 2 below. As AD shifts to AD<sub>1</sub> there is an increase in output from Y to Y<sub>1</sub> but no increase in the price level.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/63ed6fe84b97cd3e5608788ec7c7a9d1" alt=""></p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the cause of the economic growth. If the cause of economic growth is not a component of aggregate demand, but rather aggregate supply then it can be argued that an increase in economic growth will not result in an increase in the price level. This can be seen in fig. 3 below. As aggregate supply increases and aggregate demand remains constant, output increases from Y to Y<sub>1</sub> and price falls from PL to PL<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f2d8309bc4f603e89d89150ce11653a3" alt="" width="284" height="216"></p>
<p>As the productive potential of the economy increases through supply side policies such as government investment into research, development and education, then the ability of the economy to produce increases. As businesses improve their production processes and become more efficient, they are able to produce at lower costs. This allows them to expand production and decrease prices. However, it is unlikely that a government program that aims to increase the supply side potential of the economy will not involve any government spending. In this case, aggregate demand may rise too but could be offset by greater changes in aggregate supply.</p>
<p>On balance, not all economic growth results in inflation. It will depend upon the level of spare capacity within the economy. This is because greater spare capacity allows for greater increases in real GDP without putting pressure on prices. If an economy is at full employment, it is quite possible to not increase economic growth at all and only see changes in the price level. In addition, increases in aggregate supply tend to increase economic growth and decrease the price level. This may be unrealistic though, as increases in output through this method may also include some increases in aggregate demand – whether through increases in government spending, consumption or investment.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 3</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28186</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>‘Depreciation of a currency always leads to a current account surplus’. Discuss how far you agree with this statement.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Depreciation of a currency is when a currency decreases in value against another in the foreign exchange market. A current account surplus exists when the trade in goods and services, net factor payments and net transfers are positive.</p>
<p>When a currency depreciates, the goods from that country appear to be more attractive to foreign buyers. For example, a depreciation of the US dollar would lead to American exports being more attractive to overseas buyers, ceteris paribus. As foreign buyers compared the price of American goods to others in terms of their own currencies, they would soon find the American goods cheaper than before. This would give rise to American exports and increase the trade in goods and services towards a surplus. What’s more, a depreciation of the US dollar would make imports seem more expensive and Americans would tend to purchase more domestic goods. It seems a depreciation would cause net exports (exports – imports) to rise given that exports would increase and imports fall.</p>
<p>However, it would not always be the case that a depreciation of currency would lead to a balance of payments surplus. For example, if American demand for foreign goods and services is inelastic, then a currency depreciation will have little impact on the amount that Americans import. In addition, if demand for American exports is inelastic, foreign buyers may not be very responsive to a change in the exchange rate. Foreign businesses may need American goods and services and they would not be able to find suitable substitutes.</p>
<p>In addition, the length of time of the depreciation would impact the extent to which the current account tends towards a surplus. If it is over a shorter period of time, domestic and foreign purchasing behavior is less likely to change. Over a longer period of time, they will have time to adapt to changing prices and should adjust their behavior. This is also dependent upon whether the change is significant enough to impact exports and imports. A slight depreciation in the currency will have a different impact that a larger depreciation.</p>
<p>On balance, the depreciation of a currency does not always lead to a current account surplus. If the balance of payments is already deeply in a deficit, it may reduce the deficit, but it will not absolutely move towards a surplus.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 4</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28185</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the extent to which a rising exchange rate helps or harms an economy.&nbsp;<br><br></p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The exchange rate is the rate at which one currency is valued in terms of another. A rising exchange rate would indicate that a country’s currency has appreciated in value in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>If China’s currency were to appreciate, 1 RMB would exchange for a greater amount of foreign currency than it previously traded for. For example, if 1 RMB used to be equal to $0.50 and can now buy $1.00, then the exchange rate for the RMB has risen. This can both help and hurt different groups both inside and outside of China.</p>
<p>Firstly, a stronger Yuan would mean that products made outside of China appear to be relatively cheaper. This would benefit Chinese consumers who enjoy imported products and this would also help foreign businesses that sell to Chinese consumers. For example, if a Chinese student planned on attending college in the United States and had budgeted for $100,000 based on the previous exchange rate, they would now be able to exchange their funds for $200,000. This will have a great impact on Chinese consumption of foreign goods and services, surely to the benefit of foreign producers. The extent to which this will benefit the Chinese economy depends upon the benefits society gains from the consumption of foreign goods and services.</p>
<p>Secondly, the stronger Yuan would mean that products made within China appear to be relatively more expensive to foreign buyers. This can hurt a developing economy such as China’s as it has had a significant reliance on exports for boosting the country’s economy. The American consumer who used to be able to purchase a 5 Yuan item with $2.50 now has to exchange $5 to make the same purchase. They are more likely to make the purchase elsewhere. Chinese export businesses would suffer and lose out to global competition. This would lead to a reduction of production within China and thereby decrease the need for labor. Rising unemployment would result, and for a country heavily dependent on exports, this would be quite detrimental to economic growth.</p>
<p>However, if exports have inelastic demand globally, the impact on the economy would be reduced. Trading partners would continue to buy from China if they are heavily reliant on their products. If the trend continues for the long term, demand is more elastic and the impact could be more severe.</p>
<p>The extent to which a rising exchange rate harms an economy is dependent on several factors. A small or short-term change in the exchange rate will have less of an impact than a large or long-term change. In addition, if the country faces inelastic demand for its exports, then the impact is likely to be reduced. The ultimate impact will also depend on the extent to which the economy is dependent on the export market. If net exports (exports-imports) compose a relatively smaller portion of aggregate demand, then the impact will be minimized.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 5</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28184</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the extent to which free trade brings global benefits.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Free trade is the trade of goods and services globally free of any protectionist measures. Protectionist measures are measures that restrain trade between countries, such as tariffs and quotas. Global benefits of free trade are many, however there are still criticisms. Impacted groups include individuals, businesses and country governments.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of free trade would be an opportunity for a country to grow its exports. With reduced protectionist measures globally, countries would have access to larger markets. This would allow them to increase exports and experience economic growth through the increased sale of goods and services abroad. In turn, this would create jobs within the domestic economy and lower unemployment. Reduced unemployment results in greater earnings for workers, thus potentially increasing their standard of living. In addition, government would earn greater tax revenue from the workers and could use this to fund development projects within the nation.</p>
<p>Another benefit would be encouraging countries to specialize in the good they have the lowest opportunity cost in producing. This encourages economic efficiency within global production and through trade, all economies can be made better off. Consumers around the world would have greater choice and lower prices, improving consumer welfare. Large firms could benefit by achieving economies of scale as their countries specialize and this allows firms to increase productivity and potentially profitability. As countries continue to trade with each other, this could strengthen relationships between nations and allow them to share best practices in production, development and growth.</p>
<p>However, free trade does not guarantee any of these benefits. There are other concerns to address. For developing economies, protectionist measures may be necessary to protect infant industries in their early development stages. By focusing too narrowly on one specialization, a country can do itself more harm than good. It will gain in the short run by exhausting resources and developing a specialty, however lose in the long run when resources are exhausted and their specialization is no longer competitive. Nations should be careful to develop other sectors of their economy throughout this process and awareness of doing so is not always at the forefront of the goals of those seeking economic growth.</p>
<p>Unfair competitive practices may also emerge as countries seek to expand into world markets. Some countries may subsidize production of certain goods and services resulting in unfairly low priced goods competing in world markets. This will impact producers in nations where production has not subsidized and this is clearly a cause for concern. Also, there may be extensive environmental damage as producers in developed economies relocate production to countries where environmental regulation is more relaxed.</p>
<p>On balance, free trade can bring global benefits but it is not as clear as simply removing all trade barriers. The development of the WTO indicates that having a governing body to resolve trade disputes can be helpful when moving towards an environment where protectionist measures are reduced. While countries should seek to specialize in the area in which they have a comparative advantage, they should also have the opportunity to develop industries that are still in their infancy at this stage of development.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 6</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28183</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Evaluate the impact of sharp inflation on the various functions of money.

During periods of sharp inflation the price level is rising at a rapid pace. The functions of money are challenged during these periods.</p>
<p>Firstly, money serves as a medium of exchange. If an individual chooses to purchase a good or service, money will be accepted as payment. An example of this would be a student purchasing a textbook for school using currency. During periods of high inflation, people may continue to accept money, but it would be increasingly difficult to do so. This is due to the fact that since money is losing its value so quickly, a shopkeeper may prefer another item in exchange as opposed to that specific type of money. As inflation rises rapidly, money does not purchase the same items it used to. Therefore, business owners may be reluctant to accept money as payment. In Zimbabwe, during a period of hyperinflation, businesses started accepting other country’s currencies and gold as opposed to the national currency. However, money is not defined as the national currency, but only as something that is accepted as payment. In this sense, although the type of money has changed, money is still being used.</p>
<p>Secondly, money serves as a store of value. This means that an individual can store money for later use and it will have the same value when it is later withdrawn. For example, if I put my money into the bank on Monday and withdraw it next week, it should still retain its value. During periods of high inflation this is the function of money that is immediately challenged. Saving money for future use will definitely ensure the saver loses the value of their deposits. If an individual deposits $100 today, and goes to withdraw it next week, that same $100 may not buy as much as it did previously. Therefore, it is almost certain that money is not able to serve this function during periods of high inflation.</p>
<p>Thirdly, money serves as a unit of account. This means that people can determine the worth of something by looking at its price and referring to it in money terms. Its value can be determined to be based on an understanding of consumers and businesses of money’s worth. However, during periods of high inflation it becomes much more difficult to serve this function. This is because inflation is rising at such a rapid rate that both producers and consumers struggle to anticipate the true price and value of something in money terms.</p>
<p>On balance, the high rate of inflation will not affect all functions of money equally. The severest impact will be on its function as a store of value. Money will lose its ability to retain value. Secondly, money may continue to serve as a medium of exchange. However, the accepted form of money may change. Finally, the unit of account can possibly continue, but it depends on how high the rate of inflation rises. A sustained, rapid rise of prices would have a much more severe impact on this function. A sustained rapid rise would harm all three functions much more than a short term, moderate rise would.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 7</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28182</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Evaluate the impact of sharp inflation on the various functions of money.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Money is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value.

Inflation is any increase in the general price level. The interest rate is a tool of monetary policy which can be used to influence the level of aggregate demand in an economy. Along with fiscal and supply-side policy, it is effective at helping the government achieve its macroeconomic objectives.</p>
<p>An increase in the interest rate can increase the cost of borrowing for firms and individuals. This in turn will reduce borrowing, which will impact overall consumption and investment. As individuals are more reluctant to borrow at higher interest rates, they will be less likely to take out loans to purchase expensive items like homes and automobiles.</p>
<p>For businesses, higher interest rates can impact expected rates of return of projects by reducing their overall attractiveness. Higher interest rates also drive consumers to save more money as the opportunity cost of holding money has risen. All of these events will reduce consumption and investment, resulting in a decrease in aggregate demand. The effect of this can be seen below in fig. 1.</p>
<p>As the interest rate increases, aggregate demand shifts leftward, resulting in a decrease in real GDP (Yfe to Y<sub>1</sub>) and a lower price level (PL to PL<sub>1</sub>). In addition to this, a higher interest rate makes saving money in domestic banks more attractive to foreigners and they will increase their demand of the domestic currency.</p>
<p>This will cause the exchange rate to appreciate and make exports appear to be more expensive, as more foreign currency needs to be traded to buy domestic currency. This will reduce net exports (exports-imports) and further reduce aggregate demand.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/afbefae7bdf0d72da9201e15132fd55c" alt="" width="237" height="191"></p>
<p>An alternative method would be to pursue contractionary fiscal policy, which would require the government to increase taxes or reduce spending. An increase in taxes would reduce disposable income for individuals and higher corporation tax rates would drive up the cost of business. This would reduce consumption and investment, thereby reducing aggregate demand. In addition to this, government spending could be cut and aggregate demand could fall further as seen in fig. 1.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2f79dbf0da51aa77f4de3031ae831b6e" alt="" width="261" height="208"></p>
<p>Thirdly, the government could use supply-side policies to increase the aggregate output of an economy and thereby reduce the price level. By increasing the quantity and quality of the factors of production the economy would increase its productive potential and increase its long run aggregate supply, thereby increasing output and reducing the price level. However, the major drawback of this would be the length of time these policies take to be effective.</p>
<p>It is most likely that increasing the interest rate will be the most effective method of controlling inflation. In comparison to fiscal policy and supply side policy, monetary policy is quicker to enact as the central bank meets more frequently to discuss the interest rate and can adjust it far quicker than taxes or government spending could be changed. It is also worth considering the source of the inflation. If net exports, consumption or investment are the driving force behind the rising price level, then increasing the interest rate is arguably the best method to reduce inflation. If government spending were the primary cause of inflation, then it would be best to approach this problem by reducing government spending. A rise in the interest rate to reduce inflation is also only as effective as the amount by which it changes and how sensitive groups within society are to the changes.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 9</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28178</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the extent to which rising inflation will likely move a current account balance towards a deficit.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Inflation is a general increase in the price level. The current account balance consists of the trade in goods and services, net factor income and net current transfers. If the current account balance moves towards a deficit it would mean that there would be a movement towards a greater amount of money flows outward as opposed to inward.</p>
<p>A rise in the price level will increase the price of domestic products. For example, an American living in the United States in a period of rising inflation would notice that goods and services are rising in price. In this instance they may find imported goods to be cheaper or more comparable in price. Consumption may switch towards imported goods and services as opposed to American goods and services. In addition, American businesses purchasing raw materials may see the same effect on their production resources.</p>
<p>They may source from overseas as opposed to buying domestic resources as the imported resources appear to be cheaper. This would give rise to cash outflows on the current account balance as money is moving out of the country. However, the extent to which this will occur will depend upon the rise in the rate of inflation and the length of time. Consumers and businesses may not respond immediately to a slight change in inflation, but if it is over a greater period of time they may start to substitute imports for domestic goods.</p>
<p>Aside from cash outflows, cash inflows would be affected. Foreign buyers of American goods would purchase less from the United States, as American products now appear to be more expensive in comparison to goods from other countries, ceteris paribus. If other trade partners are experiencing inflation the impact may be offset. Additionally, if foreign buyers have relatively inelastic demand for American exports, there may be little they can do in response to rising prices.</p>
<p>The impact of rising inflation on the current account balance will depend upon several factors. To move towards a deficit, inflation would have to be significant enough to have an impact on the export market. If demand is relatively inelastic for goods and services, it is less likely to move the current account towards a deficit. In addition, if net factor income and net transfers are still positive and rising, then this will offset some of the movement towards deficit occurring in the difference between the trade in goods and services. Time will play an important role too. If inflation is rising for a sustained period of time, it is more likely that the current account will tends towards a deficit.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 10</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28176</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether an indirect tax is the most effective method a government can use to correct the market failure that arises from the consumption of cigarettes.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An indirect tax is a tax that is imposed on the sale or consumption of a good. Market failure occurs when the market fails to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. A demerit good is a good that causes more harm than the person consuming is aware of. In addition, it can produce negative third party spillover effects. The government is able to use a variety of methods to correct the market failure that arises from the consumption of cigarettes and an indirect tax alone may not be the most effective approach.</p>
<p>Cigarette smokers adversely impact the health of people around them through second hand smoke and also develop health problems that can burden a government provided healthcare system such as that in the UK. It is important to find methods of deterring smoking and indirect tax is but one.</p>
<p>Firstly, an indirect tax is generally placed on cigarettes in an attempt to increase their price and reduce the quantity demanded of the good. An indirect tax raises the cost of production as producers must pay a per unit tax on each product sold to the government. This will shift the supply curve leftward and result in an increase in price. It will also cause a contraction in demand. This is shown in fig. 1 below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/99606f315898af98d45b60a86625966d" alt=""></p>
<p>The issue with indirect taxes on cigarettes to reduce consumption is that they arguably do not reduce quantity demanded that much. This is because cigarettes are addictive and are usually price inelastic. Consumers are not very responsive to changes in price because they are addicted to smoking. Government attempts to address this issue through indirect taxation will be limited in their success. In order to make a significant impact on reducing smoking, more action will be necessary than just an indirect tax.</p>
<p>Another method the government can use is the provision of information. This can be more effective at preventing people from smoking from the very start. Education programs in primary and secondary schools can be effective deterrents of smoking. The government would be attempting to address the information failure that exists when school children start to try smoking. This method could be effective, but would also require significant financial resources and time commitments from the government.</p>
<p>The government could also enforce regulation that requires tobacco companies to publish health warnings on cigarette packs. In addition they could require a minimum age of purchase to restrict the sale of cigarettes to minors. This would minimize the financial burden on the government, although there will be a regulation enforcement cost to the government.</p>
<p>On balance, whether an indirect tax is the most effective method at correcting the market failure from cigarette smoking is highly contestable. Due to their inelastic demand, it is unlikely to be very effective at reducing smoking and correcting the market failure. A more effective approach would be&nbsp;to educate children about the harms of smoking to stop them from beginning. Of course this would not have an immediate effect on the issue but it would provide greater long-term results. The ideal approach will be a combination of the methods listed as each addresses a different part of the problem.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 11</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28175</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the whether an increase in the national minimum wage will make all workers better off.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The minimum wage is a government set price floor for labor. Employers are not legally permitted to pay workers a wage below this rate. Whether it will make all workers better off or not is debatable.</p>
<p>Firstly, when the government establishes a minimum wage its intention is to improve the earnings and standard of living for lower income earners. It does this by setting a price floor on wages. As it can be seen in the diagram below, the market clearing wage rate is W* and market clearing quantity of labor is Q*. However, once the government imposes a minimum wage of Wm, there is a surplus of workers resulting in unemployment (Qs-Qd). This occurs because the minimum wage has driven up the costs of businesses and therefore they are unable to employ any more workers at the given rate. Working is more attractive so individuals are more likely to supply their labor to the market. People who were previously unwilling to work for the market rate have entered the labor market and create an excess of labor, which can be seen at quantity Qs. For those workers who are able to secure employment (represented by Qd), are arguably better off for finding employment. However, the many more workers who are unemployed are certainly not better off.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e77e97202880a63203398d6cc74f8e68" alt=""></p>
<p>However, to dispute the argument against the minimum wage making all workers better off it is important to consider the actual equilibrium wage rate. If the going rate for labor is $7 and the equilibrium rate should be $9, then certainly raising the minimum wage to $9 will improve the allocation of labor in this market. There will be greater supply of workers and also a matching demand. The market will clear at $9, meaning there should be neither surplus labor nor additional demand for labor. In this case the national minimum wage is effective at making all workers better off.</p>
<p>If this situation occurs, this will decrease the burden on government for supporting those who are unable to work with unemployment benefits. In addition, this will reduce the burden felt by those in higher wage employment who are paying tax to the government. This will reduce the government’s expenditure on benefits and allow for them to use this allocation of funds elsewhere. Therefore, all&nbsp;workers could be better off. This would depend upon the government’s use of funds and whether they do act according to the best interests of all workers in the future.</p>
<p>The extent to which an increase in the national minimum wage will make all workers better off depends on several factors. Firstly, it is important to note the size of the increase. If the rate is only a marginal increase, then it may have a minimal impact on the labor market. Of course a more significant increase could have greater impact on the market. In addition, the current situation in the labor market will influence whether or not all workers are better off. The ability of the minimum wage to make all workers better off will depend upon the going wage rate and its distance from the actual equilibrium wage. In all likelihood, the raise in the minimum wage will not make all workers better off, but certainly some.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 12</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28173</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the implications of price elasticity of demand estimates to businesses.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. It is calculated by dividing the % change in quantity demanded by the % change in price. The figure is important in measuring consumer sensitivity to price changes of a product.</p>
<p>If price elasticity of demand (PED) is between 0 and 1, it can be said that demand for a product is inelastic. This means that consumers are not very sensitive to a change in price. This could be due to the fact that the product is an addiction, a necessity or potentially takes up a small part of consumer income. In addition, a business would be able to earn additional revenue by raising the price. Producers of products with inelastic demand can increase total revenue by increasing price. In fig.1 below, it can be demonstrated that an increase in price does not have a significant impact on the quantity demanded for that product.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2060a5a035cb03acc0dfe2c9331cc84f" alt=""></p>
<p>An example of this would be fuel. Producers can raise the price of fuel and due to the necessity most people have for it to power their cars, most consumers would continue to buy at the higher price. In the case of fuel, using elasticity estimates can prove beneficial. However, the value of PED estimates is in the accuracy of the data collected to calculate them. If a business is marketing a product and determines its demand is inelastic, their success would be dependent upon the quality of the data collected.</p>
<p>If price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, it can be said that demand for the product is elastic. This means that consumers are very sensitive to a change in price. This could mean that the product is a luxury, has many substitutes or takes up a great proportion of peoples’ income. In this case, producers should be very mindful of changes in price. As seen in figure 2, a decrease in price generates a far greater increase in quantity demanded, thereby increasing total revenue. However, in the case of competitive businesses, it would only be beneficial if other businesses/competitors did not lower their prices too.</p>

<p>The relevance of elasticity estimates for businesses relate primarily to total revenue. However, firms can determine the place of their product in the market when examining PED. In addition, to act on strategy that relies on elasticity estimates can be risky if the data collected is inaccurate. Also, in the long run demand for most products can become elastic. If this is the case, producers should be mindful of the length of time they raise the price of their products. Elasticity estimates can prove more useful in the short-run.</p>

Market failure occurs when the free market mechanism fails to deliver an efficient allocation of resources. A merit good is a good that has greater benefits than the consumer realizes. It can produce a positive externality, which is a positive spillover effect to a third party not involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>Diagram to show the effects of a subsidy:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/272227b8c7374415c290c1623473a503" alt=""></p>
<p>As subsidy shifts the supply curve to the right from S to S<sub>1</sub>; this lowers the price from P* to P<sub>1</sub> and increases the quantity from Q* to Q<sub>1</sub>. Therefore a subsidy on healthcare has caused there to be a payment to providers of healthcare which therefore reduces their costs. This will result in more affordable healthcare for the general public.</p>
<p>If healthcare becomes more affordable, the more people will consume it. Moreover this will also maximize consumer welfare especially for the poorer individuals as the government are subsiding one of the vital goods that has a great influence over their wellbeing. Another advantage with the introduction of subsidies on healthcare is the benefits from the increased merit goods consumed with the positive externalities, which follow. The increased health of individuals will lead to a more productive and capable workforce.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/da1a55decd040c57f4de6a1324b642f7" alt=""></p>
<p>On the positive externalities graph to the left, Q indicated the chosen level of output but from the introduction of the subsidy the quantity increases from Q to Q1 to represent the socially optimal level. Therefore this will increase benefits to society as the merit good (healthcare) will be consumed more.</p>
<p>However, subsidizing health care for all forms of healthcare can have perverse incentives. As the government makes healthcare more affordable for all, there is a risk that individuals would have less incentive to take care of their health. In addition, this may lead to healthcare being over-consumed, which would place an even greater financial burden on government. Hospitals may become more crowded and quality of service may suffer. This would adversely impact the outcomes government was seeking to achieve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, another issue with subsidizing such a vast market is determining the size of the subsidy, as it needs to reflect the growing demand for healthcare without affecting other aspects. It is also likely, that one of producer or consumer will be unhappy with the chosen size of the subsidy. In addition, the government will face an opportunity cost of time and money addressing the issue.</p>
<p>Finally, subsidizing healthcare nationally will be a significant financial commitment by the government, and for a country in economic crisis, the revenue needed to pay for it needs to be generated most likely from further spending cuts or reductions to other public sector projects.</p>
<p>On balance, the government should subsidize healthcare but do so with conditions. There should be a list of treatments that are more heavily subsidized than others – determined by necessity and importance. This task in itself would prove very controversial. It may result in an inefficient allocation of limited government resources. The given size of the subsidy may not be sufficient, resulting in government failure. There are many considerations to make before determining a subsidy is the most effective method.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 14</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：28169</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the view that market economies allocate resources more efficiently than planned economies.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A market economy is one in which all resources are allocated by market forces such as supply (from producers) and demand (of consumers), with no intervention by government. The free market system is a system that is free of any government intervention. Planned economies are systems where the government determines the allocation of scarce resources.</p>
<p>In a market economy, entrepreneurs and businesses can respond to changes in demand from the consumer side. They can supply a greater quantity of a product to the market when demand and price rises and can reduce output when demand and price falls. It is the attraction of profit that encourages private firms to meet rising consumer demand. This is a significant advantage of the market economy over the planned economy. In a market economy, there is great flexibility in business’s ability to respond to market needs. This allows for prices and output to accurately reflect what consumers want – for better or for worse.</p>
<p>For many goods, this can be beneficial to an economy. However, there is still an issue as to the provision of public goods and overprovision of demerit goods. Public goods, which are goods that are non excludable and nonrivalrous, are unlikely to be provided by private enterprise. Public goods such as national defense allow for people to enjoy the benefit of the good without having to pay for it. The same army as the individual who has paid his or her taxes protects someone who avoids tax. The enjoyment of one individual of national security does not reduce the enjoyment of others, making the good nonrivalrous. In this kind situation, a pure market system provides no incentive for producers to develop public goods.</p>
<p>From a planned economy perspective, the government will take responsibility providing public goods to ensure public welfare. This is an advantage of the planned system in that the needs of society as a whole are met through the provision of public goods.</p>
<p>In addition, in a planned economy the government can decide to prohibit or restrict the production of demerit goods, which are goods that can cause harm to an individual, such as cigarettes and alcohol. The government could also restrict the production or sale of demerit goods. However, in a market economy, there is no government to intervene, thus demerit goods are produced and consumed freely. This is to the detriment of the consumer and society. The price mechanism does not accurately reflect the cost to the individual and society.</p>
<p>On balance, it can be seen from the analysis that a market economy is not always more effective at allocating resources when compared to a planned economy. In some situations described, there can be a preference for a planned system. Most economies, however, are mixed, borrowing elements from both the market and planned systems. This allows for the welfare of society to be maximized through government intervention and regulation where necessary.</p>

The process involves producing those goods or services in which an advantage exists to that individual, business or country.</p>
<p>Individuals can benefit from specialization by improving their skill in the marketplace. For example, a teacher may become more specialized in the teaching of economics and thereby improve their productivity in teaching the subject. This in turn can lead to greater motivation for the teacher as they develop a higher level of skill in their field. Also, as they have become more productive and they are able to command higher earnings. They can use these earnings to purchase goods and services produced by other individuals who have specialized in their fields. The output generated by specialists tends to be of higher quality than those of generalists.</p>
<p>However, there are risks associated with individuals specializing. If you are a worker in a factory and become highly skilled at assembling a product, you do not have many marketable skills and therefore can be replaced by machinery and have difficulty finding a new position. In addition, doing the same monotonous task in a factory can be boring and demotivate an individual, resulting in lower productivity.</p>
<p>When a country decides to specialize it focuses on an area in which it has a comparative advantage. That will occur when they produce a good in which they have a lower opportunity cost than another country. For example, China has for a long time had a comparative advantage in production due to its vast population and low-cost labor. The opportunity cost of using labor to produce goods is lower than that of the United States, where labor is less bountiful, more skilled and better suited to other endeavors. This will allow China to capitalize on its strength in production and grow their economy through the sale of exports. As China continues to develop more effective methods of production, they can gain a stronger position in world trade.</p>
<p>However, a country should be mindful of not overspecializing. While there may be some great benefits of efficiency, it may put a country at a strategic disadvantage in the long run. The country would leave itself vulnerable to the underdevelopment of industries that may need to be competitive in the future. For example, Saudi Arabia has taken strategies to develop industries aside from petrol to avoid this very issue.</p>
<p>On balance, the extent to which specialization is helpful to an individual depends upon the ability of individuals identify the skills in which they have an advantage as well as their ability to develop new skills in case their work is replaced by capital. Higher-skilled workers are less likely to be replaced by capital and would benefit more greatly from specialization. In addition, a country’s decision to specialize will benefit it more greatly in the long run if they are also able to develop additional industries to prepare for long run competition. It will be less likely to benefit a country if they overspecialize at the expense of future growth.</p>

Price floors are minimum prices that are set for a good whereas price ceilings are maximum&nbsp;prices that are set for a good. Price floors, such as the minimum wage, are enacted to increase the earnings of the worker in the labor market. Price ceilings, such as rent controls, are aimed at protecting renters and helping them find affordable housing.</p>
<p>As for effective price floors, they are set at a price or wage above the market-clearing rate. As seen in fig. 1 below, the minimum wage has been set above the equilibrium wage and this allows for workers to earn a higher rate. However, the minimum wage increase above the equilibrium wage has resulted in an excess of supply, as quantity supplied is far greater than quantity demanded at this wage. This will result in a surplus of labor, specifically, unemployment.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b567198d571dee9be32cff0114f1743c" alt=""></p>
<p>Some workers are made better off when they find the work, however many more are not able to find work as employers find it too expensive to employ any additional labor. The intention of the government is to assist workers to earn a higher wage to live on, but the result is an increase in unemployment. An effective price floor such as the minimum wage is not effective at achieving its intended outcome as it results in more people out of work. However, if the current rate being paid by employers is below the market rate, then setting a minimum wage at what should be the market rate will benefit a lot of workers, as more will be employed.</p>
<p>Price ceilings, such as rent controls, seek to provide affordable housing to lower income individuals. An effective price ceiling is set below the market-clearing price for rent and this should help more people find more affordable accommodation. However, in doing so, the incentive for producers to supply housing falls, while at the same time the quantity demanded for housing rises. As seen in the diagram below, this results in a shortage of housing (Qd-Qs). The rent ceiling (Rc) is below the equilibrium rent (R*) and this results in a shortage of housing.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b3d767ec887f182c698ae26eff0055aa" alt="" width="350" height="257"></p>
<p>The government’s intention was likely to make housing accessible, but it in fact has reduced the ability of renter’s to find a place to live. However, if the current rate being charged by landlords is too high, then setting a price ceiling near the equilibrium price will actually improve the efficiency of the market.</p>
<p>On balance, while the intentions of government are to help individuals and improve their welfare, price controls may actually make society worse off. The ability of price controls to effectively achieve their intended outcome depends on whether current rates in the market are below equilibrium (for price floors) or above equilibrium (for price ceilings). In these situations, price controls can be effective at improving the welfare of society. Government access to information can improve the quality of the legislation, but may still not overcome the resulting inefficiencies.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 17</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9600</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'The free market is not the way to achieve a sustainable, efficient use of economic resources. Even the famous economist Adam Smith recognised that there was a need for some government involvement.'</p>

Hence all economic decisions are made by individual households and firms who act in their own self interest. The essence of a market system is price mechanism, often quoted as "invisible hand". Operating on its own, without government intervention, price mechanism allocates resources through million of decisions taken each day by consumers and businesses. So, it is believed that apparently chaotic system of millions of transactions would not only allocate resources but it would do it efficiently.</p>
<p>Efficiency generally relates to how well an economy uses its scarce resources to satisfy maximum wants of consumers. When economists use the term efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency. Allocative efficiency is when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. It occurs when the consumers' valuation (P) of a product equals the cost of resources (marginal cost) used up in its production i.e. p = MC. The graph below illustrates this concept of allocative efficiency. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5613297a1d0e0c2a5fd9985abdafadff" alt="" width="323" height="217"><br><br>The optimum allocation of resources is when output is 200 units at a price of $10 i.e. QD = QS, So the equilibrium in the market implies P = MC, and generates maximum possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus. Any situation where either P &gt; MC or P &lt; MC implies inefficient allocation of resources. An output of 100 units, for instance, indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve P = MC. Now an increase in output up to 200 units would increase both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A and hence would improve allocative efficiency. Alternatively the output of 300 units signifies that too many resources have been allocated for production because P &lt; MC. The shaded triangle B represents welfare loss. It, therefore, follows that net gains can be realized if production is reduced to 200 units.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. It exists when producers minimize the wastage of resources i.e when they produce a product using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/87057d4e1271282f08754db25f055dc1" alt="" width="331" height="227"><br><br>The curve AC<sub>3</sub> suggests productive efficiency because it indicates the lowest possible cost techniques of production for different levels of output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per unit cost therefore they all suggest productive inefficiency. Furthermore, economists use the term technical efficiency when a firm produces at the lowest point (z) on the lowest average cost curve.</p>
<p>The theory of firm predicts that each firm in a perfectly competitive market produces at the lowest point on its LRAC curve and it is not possible for any one firm to reduce its cost any further by altering its output. Every firm in perfect competition is therefore productively efficient. This is shown in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f85975dd81504e10658c3004ce186b48" alt="" width="403" height="209"><br><br>It can be analyzed from the graph that perfectly competitive firms maximize profits by equating marginal cost to price. Thus, when perfect competition is the market structure for the whole economy, price is equal to marginal cost in each line of production resulting in allocative efficiency.</p>
<p>On the contrary, a profit maximizing firm operating under imperfect market conditions will maximize profits at an output ( q) where price exceeds marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. Also the firm produces at the decreasing part of AC curve that indicates its failure to optimize use of resources.</p>
<p>It is held that even the competitive outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. In those cases market system is believed to have failed and it, therefore, results in a loss of economic and social welfare. This is because the benefits that the free-market confers on individuals or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits to the society as a whole.</p>
<p>The existence of externalities, for instance, causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer benefits on others that are not involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem created by externalities is that market forces will lead to either too little or too much production. With a positive externality, a competitive free market will produce too little of the good and with a negative externality it produces too much of the good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto the other party. More generally, whenever either party to a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency.</p>
<p>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how good or bad a particular product is for them: either they do not have the right information or they simply lack some relevant information. The problem is that imperfect information causes market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of merit and demerit goods being produced or consumed.</p>
<p>A distinct type of market failure exists in case of public goods. A good must possess three distinguishing characteristics to qualify as a public good. It must be non-excludible, non-rival and non-rejectable. These features give rise to the free rider problem; people receiving benefits from a good without contributing to its cost. Thus it develops a situation in which everyone believes that others will take on the burden of paying for goods such as national defense and streetlights. Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive to supply them. So we have goods which yield substantial benefits but to which the market system fails to allocate resources.</p>
<p>The role of the government is to intervene in markets that are not seen to be allocating and using resources in the most&nbsp;efficient manner. Government policy and methods of intervention can be summarized under four broad headings: regulation, financial intervention, direct provision and improving information.<br>In case of financial intervention indirect taxes such as changes in VAT and excise duties can be used to raise the price of demerit goods and products with negative externalities. Subsidies to consumers will lower the price of merit goods such as grants to students to reduce the internal costs of staying on in fulltime education. In addition to providing the finance it is also possible for a government to take over the production of a good or service, either in whole or in part. State-owned industries are often referred to as nationalized industries such as the electricity, coal mining and railway industries are entirely owned and managed by the state in many countries. It is also very common to find some goods and services being produced by both the state and the private sectors. Education and health care are particularly good examples of these types of service.</p>
<p>Government action can have a role in improving information to help consumers and producers value the 'true' cost and/or benefit of a good or service. Thus a failure to deliver efficient use of resources by the free market system is normally considered as justification for some form of government involvement in the economy. This intervention, however, should be designed to correct market failure with the view to achieve an improvement in economic and social welfare.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 18</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9589</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The table shows figures for annual GDP growth rates at market prices for three developing countries, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Malawi, and three developed countries, Greece, UK and USA.</p>

They are highly industrialized countries with relatively high per head incomes. Generally the better living conditions are reflected in high life expectancy, wide spread education, equal opportunities in life and access to most advanced civic amenities.</p>
<p>Developing countries, however, are mainly characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technological dependence on developed economies. These low levels of living are manifested quantitatively and qualitatively in the form of low incomes (poverty), inadequate housing, poor health, limited education, high infant mortality, low life and work expectancies, and in many cases a general sense of malaise and hopelessness.</p>
<p>ln order to assess the level of development, we must have a means of measuring the value of the nation's output. The measure that economists widely use for this purpose is called GDP. They use GDP to calculate the rate of economic growth in order to compare economic performance of an economy with that of others. <br>The data provided only indicates the rate of change in total output of six different economies. So it does not in any way suggest the value of total output which would have given some idea of their level of development.</p>
<p>Also GDP is used to calculate the rate of economic growth. Most common usage of GDP is to determine the levels of development of different economies. However, if we are to make sensible use of GDP figures, we must take inflation and size of population into account. Increasing price level, for instance, may increase the GDP figure more than the increase in output. While ignoring the changes in the size of population could give a wrong indication about the level of development.</p>
<p>However, even after making these adjustments economists question the reliability of GDP as an economic indicator of development for various reasons.<br>Firstly, national GDP figures hide significant regional variations in output, employment and incomes per head of population. Within each region there are also areas of relative prosperity contrasting with unemployment black-spots and deep-rooted social and economic deprivation. Also, GDP figures on their own do not show the distribution of income and the uneven spread of financial wealth. Incomes and earnings may be highly unequally distributed among the population and rising national prosperity can still be accompanied by rising relative poverty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, higher GDP might have been accompanied by an increase in pollution and other negative externalities which have a negative effect on economic welfare. Output figures also tell us little about the quality of goods and services produced. Also, rising national output might have been achieved at the expense of leisure time if workers are working longer hours.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need to analyse the balance between consumption and investment. If an economy devotes too many resources to satisfying the short run needs ＆ wants of consumers, there may be insufficient resources for investment needed for long term economic development.</p>
<p>GDP figures might understate the level of development because of the existence and growth of black or informal economy. Black economy includes illegal and undeclared transactions while informal sector is the non-monetised part of the economy, it includes output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and selfconsumed products. The Economist's latest estimate for the total value of the black economy throughout the world is $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. According to their survey, Nigeria and Thailand have the world's largest black economies, both accounting for more than 70% of official GDP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, GDP figures are calculated from millions of different returns to the government. Inevitably mistakes are made - returns are inaccurate or simply not completed. Therefore the figures are not exact and accurate and do not provide a precise and accurate account of economic activities.</p>
<p>It is believed that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being of a nation. Economists point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off without necessarily achieving higher GDP, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Compared to GDP figures the Measure of economic welfare (MEW) reflects the state of development more accurately. This starts with GNP and NNP. To this was added an allowance for leisure, for various non-marketed goods and services such as housework and underground activities, for the services of various public amenities such as parks and roads, and for private durable goods such as furniture and jewellary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various items were subtracted. These included regrettables such as expenditure on defence and commuting to work, and various 'bads' such as pollution. The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies around the world.</p>
<p>By far human development index (HDI) is considered the best indicator of a country's economic development. HDI is the average of three indicators:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight).</p>
<p>The closer the HDI is to 1, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that GDP growth rate or even alone GDP is not enough to classify developed and developing countries. Instead other composite measures such as MEW or HDI are more reliable.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 19</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9585</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The table shows figures for annual GDP growth rates at market prices for three developing countries, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Malawi, and three developed countries, Greece, UK and USA.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by increased supply and/or improvement in productivity of inputs such as increase in capital stock and labour force, improvement in technology and exploitation of new finds of natural resources. On the other hand short term increase in real GDP over time is known as actual growth. It is the result of rate of growth in aggregate demand and therefore measured by the rate of change in real GDP. This is usually shown on a standard AD and AS diagram as given below.</p>

<p>Economic growth is a necessity if the developing countries want to remove mass poverty, provide decent housing, adequate health care and education facilities. <br>High rate of economic growth is viewed as a positive indicator for number reasons. Provided economic growth outstrips population growth, it will lead to higher real income per head. This can result in higher level of consumption of goods and services subsequently leading to an increase in employment. Thus growth is an important avenue through which better living standards and lower rates of poverty can be achieved. This is particularly true for countries who regard growth as a key route for poverty reduction among their population.</p>
<p>Moreover growth has a positive impact on profits ＆ business confidence - good news for the stock market and for the growth of small and large businesses. All of these coupled with the rising AD and output encourage investment in capital machinery - this helps to sustain growth by increasing LRAS.</p>
<p>The government receives higher tax revenues known as "fiscal dividend". Government finances are cyclical in nature because a growing economy boosts the tax revenues flowing into the Treasury and it also provides the government with more money to finance spending projects. Also this allows the government to redistribute incomes from the rich to the poor by spending money on programmes to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p>In addition, countries with economic growth have more resources available to invest in cleaner technologies. And, as nations move to later stages of development, energy intensity levels start to fall. Much depends on how many resources an economy is willing to devote to environmental improvement and protection. Over the last thirty years, the ratio of energy consumption per unit of GDP has fallen quite significantly. The reduction in energy intensity is a reflection of improvements in production technologies and also a gradual switch towards a low carbon economy.</p>
<p>Overall economic growth has made it possible to expect to live on average 30 years longer, to work almost half the amount of time we used to every year, and to enjoy an array of new goods and services, including air travel, antibiotics, computers and televisions.</p>
<p>Although our material progress can be measured in part by the growth of national output, income and spending, but it is important to recognize that economic growth does not come risk-free.</p>
<p>There is the danger of demand-pull and cost-push inflation if demand grows faster than long run productive potential. High and rising inflation can be destabilizing for an economy because it puts pressure on interest rates to rise and can cause a loss of competitiveness for domestic businesses in international markets.</p>
<p>The current opportunity cost of growth is the present consumption. The finances can come from higher savings or higher taxes. Either way, there must be a cut in present consumption. In the short run at least, higher growth leads to less consumption.</p>
<p>Economic growth cannot be separated from its environmental impact. Fast growth of production and consumption can create negative externalities such as increased noise and air pollution and road congestion. Environmental damage can have a negative effect on our quality of life and limits our sustainable rate of growth. For example, road transport is responsible for 25% of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions once emissions from fuel processing and vehicle manufacturing are taken into account.</p>
<p>Not all of the benefits of growth are evenly distributed. We can see a rise in real GDP but also growing income and wealth inequality in society which is reflected in an increase in relative poverty. The Gini coefficient is one way to measure the inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth in different countries. The higher the value for the Gini coefficient (the maximum value is 1), then greater the inequality. Countries such as Japan, Many people believe that excessive persuit of material growth by a country can lead to a more greedy, more selfish and less caring society. As society becomes industrialized, violence, crime, stress related illnesses, suicides, divorce and other social problems are likely to rise. Although average living standards may be rising, the gap between rich and poor can widen leading to an increase in relative poverty and a widening of the gap between different regions.</p>
<p>According to the economic theory, a growing economy leads to higher living standards and greater prosperity for individuals. It also helps businesses to be profitable, which generates employment and income. However, it also imposes costs on society, therefore, nations need to view the problem as one of constrained optimization i.e. they should seek policies that will maximize growth, while keeping within its constraints.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 20</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9581</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'Lack of consumer spending causes recessions.

<li>Long run economic growth has not always been steady; it is frequently interrupted by periods of economic instability. On various times growth has given way to recession and depression. These fluctuations in economic activities are associated with trade cycles. So a trade cycle is the graphical representation of recurring ups and downs in the level of economic activities over a period of time as shown in the figure below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ac5b29250aedbf02ffe7fd16b4b4aa00" alt="" width="347" height="192"><br><br>Real growth in an economy is measured by the annual rate of change in its real GDP. While real GDP measures the inflation adjusted monetary value of total output of all goods and services produced in an economy over a year and, therefore, rightly indicates the level of economic activities. <br><br>Common usage defines a recession as a fall in real GDP for two quarters in succession. This downturn is marked by the widespread contraction of business in many sectors of the economy. Demand falls off, and, as a result, production and employment also fall. As employment falls, so do personal incomes. Profits drop, and some firms encounter financial difficulties. Business prospects are poor. Confidence is low therefore investment remains low. The effects on capital goods industry may thus be severe. Firms, finding their stocks of goods rising, cut back on production. Where cuts in production are very large then aggregate demand actually falls and there is a multiplied fall in national income. But because many prices are downwardly inflexible, the price level is likely to fall only if the recession is severe and prolonged. In historical discussion, a recession that is deep and long lasting is often called depression.<br><br>Lower economic activities are expected to result in decline in both the government tax revenue and the level of imports. Hence, the budget deficit of the government is likely to rise but the trade balance is expected to improve because decreasing incomes result in declining imports. <br><br>The main reason for these ups and downs is identified as fluctuations in aggregate demand following a change in sentiments in general. Aggregate demand is the total of all what the consumers, businesses, government and foreign buyers plan to buy at each and every price level. So, AD = C + I + G + (X - M). A change in any of these components independent of price level can shift in AD. It is held that a rise in AD is mainly the result of general optimism and, therefore, a fall in AD results from negative sentiments in general. So, generally if firms are low in confidence about the economic state of their country they are likely to reduce their business operations and postpone any investment plans giving way to recession. Similarly when workers lose their confidence in the economy, out of insecurity, they try to save more and revise their consumption plans downwards that causes AD to fall hence causes recession. Firms in return also revise their production plans downward and therefore they start laying off resources that only worsens the situation.<br><br>Many a times governments, in order to improve trade balance or remove inflationary pressure, reduce their expenditure as part of deflationary fiscal policy that results in a fall in AD and plunges the economy into recession. For some countries a fall in exports or a rise in imports causes AD to fall and hence can initiate recession. <br><br>It, therefore, follows that recession is caused by a fall in aggregate demand that may result from a lack of consumer expenditure or lack of any other component of aggregate demand.</li>
<li>The essence of the Keynesian model is that a country will come out of a recession with sufficient injections of demand into the economy. An injection of money through multiplier effect leads to a multiple increase in national income. Prices will rise and employment will be increasing in order to meet the rising demand. Eventually the country comes out of recession. The government can maintain a high level of aggregate demand through expansionary fiscal policy, and monetary policy or else government can use some direct controls.<br><br>An expansionary or inflationary fiscal policy will involve raising government expenditure and/or lowering taxes this will have the effect of either increasing the budget deficit or reducing the budget surplus. It is where the government alters the balance between government expenditure (G) and taxation (T), and thereby alters the balance between injections and withdrawals with a view to increase aggregate demand. The graph below illustrates the effect on national income.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/16b02b069a55844992a381c5d172bd90" alt="" width="382" height="187"><br><br>Faced with a recession, a government may lower taxes in order to reduce the fall in disposable income. This would reduce the volumes of overall withdrawals as shown by a shift from W to W<sub>1</sub>. On the expenditure side, the government maintains all public projects and obligations. The government may even embark on new public projects for the purpose of providing jobs in order to keep aggregate demand strong. This is shown by an upward shift in over all injection into the circular flow. Following these changes we can locate the new equilibrium at a higher level of national income Y<sub>1</sub>.<br><br>Another noticeable point is that the resulting change in national income is proportionately more than the combine changes in W and J. This is attributed to the multiplier process.<br><br>On the monetary side, various quantitative and qualitative tools can be used in order to increase the money supply and lower interest rate. This will boost consumer expenditure and business investments. The central bank, for instance, can lower its lending rate, buy up government securities and relax regulations on reserve ratios and special deposits. All these measures will increase money supply and lower interest rate that is expected to boost consumer and investment expenditures leading to a rise in aggregate demand. Apart from this all controls on mortgage, deferred payments and hire purchases can be relaxed in order to stimulate demand. <br><br>ln case of direct controls compulsory savings contributions by employees and employers can be reduced, the government can allow a lower age for compulsory pension funds withdrawals. The consumption of certain goods and services can be made compulsory. Examples are estate, cars and machinery maintenance must be done regularly. <br><br>However, getting out of a recession may not be that simple. A recession prevails because of negative expectations. Consumers and producers believe that the situation in near future can get even worse. Demand, therefore falls further, leading to more stocks accumulation and more retrenchment. Thus they would save even more to last out the bad times. The increase in money supply brought about by the government's expansionary policy is, therefore, simply leaked away. <br><br>Leakages may also come in the form of imports and capital outflows. The former is unlikely but the latter happens because the rich seeks their fortune in other countries where economics are booming. <br><br>In order to bring its economy out of a recession, the government has to convince people that conditions are favourable for investment and consumption. The government would have to cap all leakages. This can be done by reassuring the public that the economy is picking up. Publishing economic indicators would convince the business class of rising demand. The government may also have to ban the outflow of capital. <br><br>Another problem is that production may not be able to expand, if the infrastructure of the economy has deteriorated or if there are still labour management problems. The government would have to remove all such 'bottlenecks' by intervening directly into the markets. <br><br>Perhaps the more serious problem facing the government is financing a budget deficit. How is a government going to spend more than it collects? It will have to borrow, which would be difficult domestically (incomes have already fallen). If it borrows externally, it has been argued that, the recession has been postponed to a later date. This is because the government will have to pay back even more in the future. The increases in taxes and reduction in expenditure in the future may bring back the recession. <br><br>Thus the government has to adopt a variety of different quantitative and qualitative measures in order to pull the economy out of recession.</li>

It is entirely dependent on the forces of supply and demand.'</p>
<p>Do you agree with this statement?</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>According to the theory of firm, price of a product is determined by the market forces of demand and supply only when a market can be classified as perfectly competitive. However, when various market imperfections such as varying number of firms, entry exit barriers, differentiated product, and imperfect information exist it is not the case. In fact the theory of firm does provide room to analyze how price in such conditions is determined. Similarly the theory of labour explains wage determination through the forces of demand and supply only where it can be classified as perfectly competitive labour market.</p>
<p>In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic theory goes, many firms compete with one another in hiring a specific type of labour. Also, there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product, MRP<sub>L&nbsp;</sub>is the increase in revenue resulting from employing an additional worker. MRP<sub>L</sub> is determined by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied by the MR i.e. MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/945e151ada59854ba95bb8ff3e15357e" alt="" width="412" height="173"></p>
<p>In the figure above, both the equilibrium wage rate and level of employment are determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves as shown in the left part of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this type of labor up to the point at which its MRP<sub>L</sub> is equal to marginal cost oflabour (MC<sub>L</sub>) as given in the right part of the graph. MC<sub>L</sub> is the cost of hiring an additional worker and it remains the same because an individual firm can employ each additional worker at the same wage rate without affecting the market wage rate in any way. So, a profit maximizing firm will not hire any worker whose MRP<sub>L</sub> is less than his MC<sub>L</sub> simply because it will reduce the firm's profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equilibrium wage rate remains there so long as demand and supply conditions do not change. If, however, either market demand or supply or both change the equilibrium wage rate can also change. When most of the firms, for instance, introduce a new training program with the view to improve productivity of their workers or else they provide improved equipments to their workers, then the result could be a higher MRP<sub>L</sub> leading to an increase in demand for labour and hence the wage rate. That is not all in fact a change in the market price of the product that labour produces will affect their MRP<sub>L</sub> and hence their demand and the wage rate. Similarly a decrease in wage rate in other similar industries may increase supply of labour in the other and therefore results in excess supply of labour leading to a fall in the wage rate. Also, if number of individuals who qualify to work in an occupation declines, say due to migration abroad, then supply of labour decreases and the resulting shortage drives the wage rate up.</p>
<p>So, the equilibrium wage rate may rise or fall in response to a change in demand and supply under the conditions of perfectly competitive labour market. In the real world, however, conditions of a perfectly competitive labour market cannot hold in many cases just like conditions of perfectly competitive product market rarely exist. The theory of wage determination then provides room to analyze how wage rate will be determined just like theory of firm explains how price determination is not entirely dependent on the market forces of demand and supply in imperfect market. So, now we extend our analysis to allow various market imperfections, such as monopsony, trade unions and government intervention.</p>
<p>In the contrary to perfect market there may be, for instance, a single buyer of labour- a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory is the main source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, the monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market supply curve and in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a higher wage rate that causes MC<sub>L</sub> to be higher than the wage rate. This is illustrated in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b0a051410dfd391ceccda5be00b46d96" alt="" width="348" height="220"></p>
<p>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ where the MC<sub>L</sub> is equal to the MRP<sub>L</sub>, i.e. point A, hence L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate, however, is given by the average cost curve S (AC<sub>L</sub>) and this will be W<sub>1</sub>. The point to consider is that wage rate is not entirely determined by the demand and supply forces, the theory, however, can be extended to analyze a situation such as this.</p>
<p>Trade unions also influence the market wage through collective bargaining. It involves the direct negotiation between a trade union and the employers. Successful collective bargaining in a perfectly competitive labour market could raise the wage rate from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub> , as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/531fee106335c2f3bb179736a730fd97" alt="" width="394" height="250"></p>
<p>In this case it's the trade union and the management deciding the wage rate with certain negotiations rather than the forces of demand and supply. There may be individuals who are willing to work for a wage below W<sub>2</sub> but they would be prevented from doing so by the union agreement.</p>
<p>Similar to this a government, considering the equilibrium wage rate w<sub>1</sub> too low, may decide to fix w<sub>2</sub> as the minimum wage and then makes it illegal to pay a wage below this. The government in this case also overpowers the market forces and determines the wage rate that it thinks is fair.</p>
<p>So, it follows that wage determination in labour market just like price determination in a product market is entirely dependent on perfect market conditions.</p>
<p>However, when either of the two markets is subject to imperfections we can change our analysis to accommodate other factors that over power the market forces of demand and supply.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 22</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9572</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>The theory of firm assumes that all firms, regardless of market conditions, aim to maximize profit. It means that they produce an output where the last unit sold earns as much as it costs. This is generally used as a rule for profit maximization and is written in an equation as MC = MR. Where MC stands for marginal cost, the cost of producing an extra unit. MR stands for marginal revenue, a measure that indicates the addition to the revenue earned from selling an extra unit. <br><br>Perfect competition is one of many different types of market conditions that economist use to explain a firm's behavior. It is characterized by large number of relatively small firms producing homogeneous products in the absence of entry exit barriers. Price in such conditions is determined by total demand and supply forces in the market and the huge number of sellers and enormity of the market suggest that none will have enough market power to influence the price through its own individual actions. Thus all the firms are price takers and each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve which it uses it to determine its profit maximizing output. <br><br>A monopoly, however, exists when there is one firm in the industry. It is characterized by selling a unique product and existence of high entry exit barriers. Compared with other market structures, demand under monopoly will be relatively inelastic at each price. This gives monopolist substantial powers to charge a high price. Nevertheless, it is still constrained by its demand curve i.e. a rise in price will lower the quantity demanded. <br><br>So according to the theory price and output levels may vary from one type of market to another. The graph below can be used for a comparative analysis of a perfectly competitive firm and a monopoly in the short run.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e3ded39fd457ddaff42a79feef8ee1e0" alt="" width="368" height="254"><br><br>The graph represents the market in a perfectly competitive situation The AR curve is the market demand curve and MC represents the sum of MC curves of all individual firms, it, therefore, represents market supply curve. So this intersection of market demand and supply determines OP as the equilibrium price in the market and all individual firms use this to set their own output levels. Since each firm can sell how much it produces at this price therefore an individual firm's demand curve is drawn as infinite elastic.&nbsp;<br><br>Let's assume that somehow the industry is monopolized by a single firm. The market demand curve now becomes the monopolist demand curve. So now the monopolist is facing a downward sloping demand curve that produces an MR curve below his AR curve. It suggests that MR now will be less than AR = P at each level of output. This is because if the monopolist chooses to sell more he must reduce his price and when he does that the cut in price applies to the total quantity that causes his MR to fall more than the cut in price. The supply curve in the market now represents MC curve of the monopolist. Assuming no change in cost conditions the profit maximizing rule MC = MR now results in a higher price and lower output than that of a perfectly competitive industry. <br>In the long run, however, if monopolist is able to achieve substantial economies of scale say due to a larger plant, centralized administration etc. the result may be different. If that is the case it may result in an MC curve substantially below that of the same industry under competitive market, monopoly may produce a higher output at a lower price. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/faf8cf38cbc588db91c2cfa65671a7c8" alt="" width="364" height="267"><br><br>In the figure above monopolist produces Q<sub>1</sub> and charges P<sub>2</sub> price. Let us compare this with price P<sub>2</sub> and output Q<sub>2</sub> when market is perfectly competitive (QD = QS). Perfectly competitive price is higher and output lower than what monopoly produces (MC = MR). This, however may not be the usual outcome in all situations in the long run. Even when a monopolist benefits from economies of scale in pursuit of even higher profits he may well be charging a price higher and selling a lower output than a perfectly competitive firm. <br><br>So, firms in varying market conditions may sell different quantities at different prices when they seek to maximize profit.</li>
<li>The traditional theory of the firm tends to make a standard assumption that businesses, regardless of their sizes, possess the information, market power and motivation to set a price and output with the view to maximize profits in the short or long run.<br>However, in real world firms do not always want to maximize profit while remaining small. A few more&nbsp;ambitious entrepreneurs may prefer other alternative objectives to profit maximization such as growth, or sales revenue maximization etc.&nbsp;<br><br>In many cases firms target growth as their objective. This is particularly true when firms look to reduce their average costs and hence take advantage of economies of scale. These advantages come in a variety of ways known as technical, marketing, financial, managerial and risk bearing economies.<br>As a firm grows in size it may, for instance, benefit from increased specialization. The firm may also gain on marketing its products. When, for instance, a firm buys its raw materials in bulk it may obtain preferential terms in the form of a discount, thus reducing the cost of each unit. On the financial front a larger firm may be able to obtain finance on favourable terms, obtaining loans from financial institutions at lower rates of interest. In addition to this a large firm normally produces more than one product and therefore takes advantage of economies of scope. Economies of scope refer to the reduction in average total cost (ATC) made possible by a firm increasing the number of different goods it produces. The reason is that the firm is able to take advantage of skilled staff and technology which can be shared by the different goods produced. <br><br>Economies of scale have the effect of increasing the productive capacity of the business and they help to raise profit margins. They also give a business a competitive edge in domestic and international markets. In other cases firms may wish to grow to increase their market dominance thereby giving them increased pricing power in specific markets. Monopolies, for example, can engage in price discrimination. Also the expansion of a business might be motivated by a desire to diversify production and sales so that falling sales in one market might be compensated by healthier demand and output in another market.<br>This is not all, in fact in some cases a firm may try and maximize sales revenue. It typically involves businesses charging lower prices for their products contrasted with profit maximisation. Usually the underlying objective is to achieve a rapid growth of market share subject to the constraint that they need to achieve a minimum rate of profit (normal profit). This usually is typical with manager-controlled businesses where the annual salaries and other perks might be more closely correlated with total sales revenue rather than profits. <br><br>However, it is also true that small firms such as sole traders and many partnerships, while operating with the view to maximize profit, prefer to remain small. One of the prime reasons for this continued existence of small concerns is the desire to be one's own boss; once this desire is met entrepreneurs may be content with a relatively quiet life and achievement of a satisfactory level of profit. Not only this the firm may remain small in order to take advantage of a low price elasticity of demand and high income elasticity of demand for specialist "niche' goods and services - these products can be sold at a higher price and with a bigger profit margin. Also some firms remain small because they can avoid diseconomies of scale associated with larger firms.&nbsp;<br><br>It, therefore, follows that some firms may seek to grow in size while others can target profit maximization even when they intend to remain small.</li>

Unemployment can be expressed as a number or a percentage. Unemployment rate is the percentage of the work force that is unemployed. The work force can be defined as those who are employed and unemployed.</p>
<p>Even when there is no general disequilibrium in the economy at the current wage levels, there will still be&nbsp;some unemployment. This is also known as the natural rate of unemployment. For various reasons not all vacancies will be filled. The problem is one of the mismatching. Structural and seasonal are two such type of unemployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand or supply in the economy. People made redundant in one part of the economy due to a long run decline in demand in particular industries cannot immediately take up jobs in other parts or other industries. Moreover, there may be a technological change resulting in mismatch between skills of unemployed workers and skills required for jobs. Hence, structural unemployment exists where there is a mismatch between their skills and the requirements of the new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Seasonal unemployment, on the other hand occurs when the demand for certain types of labour fluctuates with the seasons of the year. For instance, employment in fruit picking and holiday catering is seasonal in character. The difficulty is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are not substitutable. <br>Keynesian unemployment is referred to as demand deficient or cyclical unemployment. The term cyclical unemployment entails the alternate booms and slumps in the level of economic activity due to the fluctuations in aggregate demand. Unemployment increases when aggregate demand is too small, there being a deficiency of demand for goods and services. Since labour is a derived demand, the lack of demand for goods and services will also lead to a deficiency of demand for labour.</p>
<p>A general rise in incomes could result in an increase in aggregate demand. So, when demand for all goods and services rises firms will have an economic incentive to increase their output levels and therefore they would require more of all the resources including labour. Since the source of cyclical unemployment is the deficiency of aggregate demand therefore it is likely to decrease. Structural unemployment, however may not decrease as the real cause of it is that of mismatch between the skills required by the firms and the skills that those unemployed possess. Textile workers made redundant will have no job opportunities if there is a growing demand for workers in electronic industry.</p>
<p>So far as seasonal unemployment is concerned it may change due to the rise in demand. It, however, depends on whether increasing demand for labour includes the jobs requiring the skills that the worker possess and also the workers can work in other industries in their off season. Agricultural workers, for instance, can work in construction industry.</p>
<p>It, therefore, follows that rising general incomes may not change all types of unemployment.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 24</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9564</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Describe how consumer theory suggests a rise in income will cause a consumer's demand to change for a normal good and for an inferior good.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Effective demand is the desire to buy a good backed by the ability to pay the market price. Therefore, it is obvious that there must be a relationship between demand for a product and the consumer's ability that is referred to his purchasing power. According to the consumer theory purchasing power is affected by changes in income therefore the two are closely linked. The nature of this relationship, however, depends upon the type of product in question and the level of income. It is held that if other things remaining unchanged demand for a normal good rises as income increases and vice versa. Such good is said to have a positive income effect as there exists a direct relationship between consumer's income and his demand for that good. If, however, demand for a good falls as income rises the good is said to have a negative income effect and it's identified as an inferior good. Following graph illustrates these relationships. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/04ac76eebeb77ed28460a08ab15c61ed" alt="" width="316" height="193"><br><br>It can be noted that demand for a normal good rises continuously with income. However the graph tends to flatten out at higher levels of income because people get close to their saturating point. For some normal goods such as fresh vegetables the curve flatten very quickly as people reach their desired level of consumption. We can also observe that demand for inferior goods behaves like the demand curve for normal goods at lower level of income. This suggests that all inferior goods start out as normal goods and become inferior only as income continues to rise. Initially people will increase their demand for potatoes, for instance, but as their incomes rise beyond a certain point they will buy other items of food such as meat, fish, fresh fruits etc. This is because they substitute potatoes with other food items that they regard as better food items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both cases how much demand responds to change in income depends on income elasticity of demand. Income elasticity of demand (YED) is the responsiveness of demand for a product to changes in income. The coefficient of YED is measured by the following.</p>
<p>YED = (Percentage change in the quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in the income)</p>
<p>So, the coefficient of YED tells us what the % change in the quantity demanded for a good is following a given change in the income of the consumer. These % changes are calculated by dividing the change in income by the original income and the change in quantity demanded by the original quantity demanded. <br>Regardless of sign when the coefficient of YED &gt; 1, demand is said to be income elastic. This is the case when the percentage change in quantity demanded outweighs the percentage change in income. When, however, coefficient of YED &lt; 1, demand is said to be income inelastic. In that case percentage change in income outweighs percentage change in demand. Demand is unitary elastic when proportionate changes in demand and income are identical. There may be a case of zero income elastic demand. It is when a change in income has no effect whatsoever on the quantity demanded.</p>
<p>With income elasticity of demand the sign attached the ratio is all important. A plus sign (+) signifies a normal good whereas a minus sign (-) reveals that the good in question is 'inferior'. For most goods the coefficient of YED is positive i.e. demand for a normal good always rises with income. Normal goods are further classified into: (i) Superior goods (luxury goods) for which income elasticity of demand is greater than unity, and (ii) Basic goods for which income elasticity of demand is less than 1.</p>
<p>Although the quantity demanded of a normal good always rises with income, it rises more than proportionately for a superior good, for example, luxury cars. Conversely, demand for a basic good such as detergent rises at a slower rate than income. The negative coefficient, however, suggests that demand falls as income rises or it rises when income falls. Consumers, for instance, decrease the purchase of goods, such as used clothes, as their incomes rise. <br>So according to the theory consumers' demand rises with income for normal goods and falls as income rises for inferior goods.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 25</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9561</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food scarcity: a world crisis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2012, families in poorer countries were forced to have days without food each week. A report by a large children's charity claimed that such days were now a part of life for up to 24% of families in India, 27% in Nigeria and 14% in Peru.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the reasons for this was the changing condition of demand and supply in world cereal markets as shown in Fig. 1. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/bfa6ef326c70fd6b0d74f1481da9d854" alt="" width="575" height="323"><br><br>Droughts and heatwaves in 2012 reduced production in some of the world’s leading cereal&nbsp;producers such as the United States (US), Ukraine and Australia. This shortage was combined&nbsp;with the increase in demand for corn to make biofuels. In 2012, more corn was used for ethanol&nbsp;production to fuel cars in the US than was used for animal feed. As a consequence, prices of meat&nbsp;and dairy products rose as farmers found it more expensive to feed cattle, pigs and poultry. This&nbsp;was particularly noticeable, as a general rise in incomes resulted in an increased consumption of&nbsp;meat. Stocks of cereals were used to reduce the shortages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During 2012, the world cereal harvest was expected to be 3% lower than that of 2011. More significantly, it was expected to be 4% lower in per capita terms because the world's population increased by 80 million in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The changes in the cereal market affected developing and developed economies in different ways. On average, people living in the US spend 9% of their income on food, while those living in the developing world spend between 50% and 70% of their income on food. World cereal prices rose between 10% and 25% in 2012, but in countries affected by drought in Africa, such as Mozambique, they more than doubled.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A charity organisation has forecasted that rice and wheat prices will double again in the next 20 years with disastrous consequences for the poor.</p>

<li>A total of 3% lower supply of food grain is expected in the world cereal market. This can be attributed to the following;
<ol>
<li>Drought and heat wave conditions adversely affecting major suppliers.</li>
<li>Increase in world demand due to increase of 80+ million world population.</li>
<li>Grain was used to make bio-fuels in some countries.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the figure both demand and supply showed an increased trend but there was a continued increase in consumption indicated by a "straight line" while production was more erratic with peaks and troughs resulting in periods of shortages and surpluses. So, in times of shortages the rising prices are expected to create a potential to increase farmers' profit. However, it is subject to changes in conditions such as cost of production, availability of stocks and elasticities of demand and supply. Availability of stocks, for instance, can offset demand pressure on cereal prices and therefore can limit the potential to earn higher profits. Similarly changes in costs of production have a bearing on farmers' profits. Since there is no evidence provided on such factors, therefore, the effect of changes in world cereal market on all farmers' profit is uncertain.<br><br></li>
<li>The higher the proportion of income spent on food grains the more the impact of changes in their prices. It is given in the text that people in developing economies spend 50% to 70% of their incomes on food. This is because people in these countries have relatively lower incomes and food, being a necessity, takes up a larger proportion of their incomes. This can be supported by the evidence that the countries affected by drought in Africa, prices more than doubled and in many more countries some families had to ration consumption as prices increased. <br><br>So far as the developed economies are concerned they suffered losses of production due to climate but also faced competing demands for grain to make ethanol for car fuel. However, the effects on these countries were less severe because the proportion of income spent on food, 9% in the US for instance, is considerably lower, because food has a saturation point as people get richer. <br><br>So the evidence in the article does support the argument that a 10-25% increase in food grain prices affected developing countries more than it did to the developed countries.<br><br></li>
<li>Traditionally, main macroeconomic aims of government policy can be seen as the achievement of full employment, price stability, economic growth and balance of payments equilibrium. The rising world food grain prices will have a direct bearing on rate of inflation and balance of payment. <br><br>Control of inflation is important because if inflation gets out of control, the economy stops growing. Rising world prices of food grain will leave many governments struggling to achieve the targeted rate. The impact on the overall inflation rate of individual countries, however, will depend on the proportion of income spent on food grains which is then used in a country's CPI as weight. So, it is expected to contribute more to the overall inflation rate in developing economies than the developed economies. Increasing demand, however, can boost production and employment thus relieving some pressure on prices. Where supplies don't improve the authorities will be forced to raise interest rates to counter inflation. At higher interest rate consumers stop borrowing to spend and firms also reduce borrowing to invest. Exports become less competitive and the economy may well drop into a recession. <br><br>Balance of payment is a summary of all economic transactions of a country with other nations over one year time period. Rising world food prices might cause a persistent BOP deficit that will initially result in a decline in a nation's foreign currency reserves and a run on its exchange rate. Ultimately, it would necessitate borrowing and the country is likely to accumulate foreign debts, which have to be repaid with interest in future. However the exporting countries might benefit from the rising prices as their export earnings may improve due to the low price elasticity of demand. This however will depend on their continued surplus of food grains. <br><br>So, the changes in the world cereal market in 2012 might have left many governments struggling to deal with the rising price level and growing balance of payment deficit.</li>

</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Many developing countries possess high population growth potential that adds a substantial number to the total population, leading to an ever growing working age population. However, most of those workers lack necessary skills and knowledge required in job markets. At the same time these countries are also characterized as capital poor economies. There is not only an extremely small capital stock but the rate of capital formation is also very slow. The root cause of capital deficiency is the problem of low level of saving leading to the low rate of investment in productive resources. As a consequence these economies fail to create the required number of jobs. So the result is relative abundance of labour to capital.<br><br>This, however, is not typical of all developing countries nor can this be associated with only developing world. Some of the developed countries may share the same feature. Typically developed world consists of countries that are economically advanced and technologically independent. While developing countries are mainly characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technologicald ependence on developed economies. Thus developing countries have more than this in common that differentiates them from developed countries.<br><br>In developing nations general levels of living tend to be very low for the vast majority of people. This is true not only in relation to their counterparts in rich nations but often also in relation to small elite groups within their own societies. These low levels of living are manifested quantitatively and qualitatively in the form of low incomes( poverty), inadequate housing, poor health, limitede ducation, high infant mortality, low life and work expectancies, and in many cases a general sense of malaise and hopelessness.<br><br>In developing countries two-thirds or more of the people live in rural areas and their main occupation is agriculture. Such countries, therefore specialize in the production of raw materials and foodstuffs. These countries do possess natural resources but many of those resources remain unutilized or underutilized due to various inhibition such as lack of technical knowledge and non-availability of capital.<br><br>Furthermore, there is vast open unemployment and disguised unemployment in developing countries. The unemployment spreads with urbanization and the spread of education because the manufacturing sector fails to expand along with the growth of labour force. Along with the rapid spread of urbanization and the urban bias strategies, has come the prolific growth of huge slums and shantytowns which results in overcrowding and pollution. Today slum settlements represent over one-third of the urban population in all developing countries; in many cases they account for more than 66% of the urban total. Most of the settlements are without clean water, sewage systems, or electricity. For example, metropolitan Cairo is attempting to cope with a population of 10 million people with a water and sanitation system built to serve 2 million. <br><br>Over all manifestations of economic backwardness in developing countries are low labour efficiency, factor immobility, and limited specialization. In addition lack of adequate infrastructure, for whatever reason, such as roads, bridges railways harbours etc. results in lower mobility of workers and goods leading to lower incomes and pockets of high regional unemployment.<br><br>So far as the composition of GDP is concerned, most developing economies are oriented toward the production of primary products (agriculture, fuel, forestry, and raw materials) as opposed to secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (service) activities. These primary commodities form their main exports to other nations. Their manufacturing sector comprises of small scale cottage industry.<br><br>Furthermore, the technology in developed economies is extremely advanced. They are now venturing into genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. On the contrary, developing economies lack indigenous technology and therefore import capital equipments from the developed countries. Moreover, developing countries usually have poor infrastructure, old means of transportation and communication, frequently interrupted supplies of power, water and gas. Productivity of workers in these economies is low mainly due to low health standards, poor training and low capital-labour ratio. <br><br>Population of developed economies is small relative to their GNP. They also have much lower birth rate and a longer life expectancy. Their population composition is made up of a larger middle and old age group relative to the young. The literacy rate is usually close to 100% if not 100%. In contrast to this, size of the population in developing economies is high relative to their GNP. Due to the high rate of population growth the proportion of young is relatively high than middle and old people, thus the age structure makes a pyramid. Their general literacy rate is low and the proportion of people with higher education is even lower.&nbsp;<br><br>Therefore it follows that relative abundance of labour to capital is not the most significant difference between developed and developing countries.</li>
<li>In order to assess the level of development, we must have a means of measuring the value of the nation's output. The measure that economists widely use for this purpose is called GDP. We define GDP as the monetary value of total output produced within the country over a twelve month period.<br><br>GDP is used to compare performance of an economy compared to other countries. Also GDP is used to calculate the rate of economic growth. Most common usage of GDP is to determine the levels of development of different economies. However, if we are to make sensible use of GDP figures, we must take inflation and size of population into account. Increasing price level, for instance, may increase the GDP figure more than the increase in output. Ignoring the changes in the size of population could give a wrong indication about the level of development.<br><br>However, even after making these adjustments economists question the reliability of GDP as an economic indicator of development for various reasons.<br>Firstly, national GDP figures hide significant regional variations in output, employment and incomes per head of population. Within each region there are also areas of relative prosperity contrasting with unemployment black-spots and deep-rooted social and economic deprivation. Also, GDP figures on their own do not show the distribution of income and the uneven spread of financial wealth. Incomes and earnings may be highly unequally distributed among the population and rising national prosperity can still be accompanied by rising relative poverty.<br><br>Furthermore, higher GDP might have been accompanied by an increase in pollution and other negative externalities which have a negative effect on economic welfare. Output figures also tell us little about the quality of goods and services produced. Also, rising national output might have been achieved at the expense of leisure time if workers are working longer hours. <br><br>Moreover, we need to analyse the balance between consumption and investment. If an economy devotes too many resources to satisfying the short run needs and wants of consumers, there may be insufficient resources for investment needed for long term economic development. Faster economic growth might improve living standards today but lead to an over-exploitation of scarce finite economic resources thereby limiting future growth prospects. <br><br>GDP figures might understate the level of development because of the existence and growth of black or informal economy. Black economy includes illegal and undeclared transactions while informal sector is the non-monetised part of the economy, it includes output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed products. The Economist's latest estimate for the total value of the black economy throughout the world is $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. According to their survey, Nigeria and Thailand have the world's largest black economies, both accounting for more than 70% of official GDP.&nbsp;<br><br>Lastly, GDP figures are calculated from millions of different returns to the government. Inevitably mistakes are made - returns are inaccurate or simply not completed. Therefore the figures are not exact and accurate and do not provide a precise and accurate account of economic activities.<br><br>It is believed that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being of a nation. Economists point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off without necessarily achieving higher GDP, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse. <br><br>Compared to GDP figures the Measure of economic welfare (MEW) reflects the state of development more accurately. MEW is one of the alternative measures developed to overcome the problems of using GDP as an indicator of development. This starts with GNP and NNP. To this was added an allowance for leisure, for various non-marketed goods and services such as housework and underground activities, for the services of various public amenities such as parks and roads, and for private durable goods such as furniture and jewellary.<br><br>On the other hand, various items were subtracted. These included 'regrettables' such as expenditure on defence and commuting to work, and various 'bads' such as pollution. Also various intermediate items such as the benefits of education were subtracted. The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies around the world.<br>By far human development index (HDI) is considered the best indicator of a country's economic standard of living. HDI is the average of three indicators:<br><br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight)<br>
<p>The closer the HDI is to 1, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators.<br><br>Thus it can be concluded that GDP is not a reliable measure of differences of living standard between developed and developing countries. Instead other composite measures such as MEW or HDI are more reliable.</p>

<li>Unemployment is defined as people who are out of work but, have actively looked for a job over a certain period of time. Unemployment can be expressed as a number or a percentage. Unemployment rate is the percentage of the work force that is unemployed. The work force can be defined as those who are employed and unemployed.<br><br>Cyclical unemployment is involuntary unemployment due to a lack of aggregate demand for goods and services. This is also known as Keynesian "demand deficient" unemployment and is associated with the transition of the economy through the business cycle. When there is an economic recession we expect to see a rising level of unemployment because of plant closures and worker layoffs. This is due to a fall in demand leading to a contraction in output across many industries.<br><br>Although demand deficient unemployment is usually associated with economic recessions it can also exist in the long run when the economy is constantly run below capacity. As the economy recovers from a downturn, we expect to see the problem of cyclical unemployment decline. The concept can be illustrated on the following graph showing AD ＆ AS. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/993871ece3b7e70686f8bcc11fa9dea0" alt="" width="374" height="271"><br><br>A fall in aggregate demand from AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub> results in a decrease in national income from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub> and as such there is an increase in the numbers employed. Labour, after all, is a derived demand, derived from the demand for the good that is being produced. So, if there is a fall in the demand for products in the goods market then the demand for labour will fall causing unemployment. Consider the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/571f5421b91811be17aa83c193d871ba" alt="" width="327" height="238"><br><br>In the diagram we see that the equilibrium wage is W<sub>1</sub> giving a level of employment of L<sub>1</sub>. Keynesians argue that in times of recession, the aggregate demand curve for the economy as a whole shifts to the left. This causes the demand for labour curve to shift to the left as well (from DL<sub>1</sub> to DL<sub>2</sub>). If the real wage rate stays at W<sub>1</sub> then there will be L<sub>1</sub> - L<sub>2</sub> workers involuntarily unemployed.<br><br>Of course, the classical economists would argue that the real wage rate would fall to the new equilibrium (wage W<sub>2</sub>, employment L<sub>3</sub>). The level of employment would fall (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>3</sub>) but there would be no involuntary unemployment. Keynes argued that this would not necessarily happen because wages and prices are 'sticky downwards'. Even if the real wage rate falls, the lower incomes of the workers would lead to lower spending in the economy, a further reduction in aggregate demand and a further reduction in the demand for labour. So, it is held that the government can use macro-economic policies to increase the level of aggregate demand. These policies might involve lower interest rates or lower direct taxes. It might also encourage foreign investment into the economy from foreign multinational companies.<br><br>On the other hand classical economists believe that the causes of increase in unemployment fall into two broad categories: Equilibrium unemployment (NRU) and disequilibrium unemployment (real wage unemployment). <br><br>Real wage unemployment or classical unemployment is where trade unions use their monopoly power to derive wages above the market clearing level resulting in an excess supply of labour. Governments introducing minimum wage legislation could also cause it. Consider the following graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7fa3b5fc943ab0659d6932d7838c7488" alt="" width="341" height="265"><br><br>If a real wage (W<sub>2</sub>) is fixed above the equilibrium real wage (W<sub>e</sub>) then the result is an excess supply of labour equal to q<sub>3</sub> - q<sub>1</sub> real wage unemployment.<br>Even when there is no general disequilibrium in the economy at the current wage levels, there will still be some unemployment. This is known as the natural rate of unemployment. For various reasons not all vacancies will be filled. The problem is one of the mismatching. There are various types of equilibrium unemployment.<br><br>Frictional unemployment is transitional unemployment due to people moving between jobs. For example, newly redundant workers or workers entering the labour market for instance, university graduates, may take time to find appropriate jobs at wage rates they are prepared to accept. Thus, many are unemployed for a short time whilst involved in job search. Imperfect information in the labour market may make frictional unemployment worse if the jobless are unaware of the available employment opportunities.&nbsp;<br><br>Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand or supply in the economy. People made redundant in one part of the economy due to a long run decline in demand in particular industries cannot immediately take up jobs in other parts or other industries. Hence, structural unemployment increases when there is a growing mismatch between their skills and the requirements of the new job opportunities. <br><br>Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for certain types of labour fluctuates with the seasons of the year. For instance, employment in fruit picking and holiday catering is seasonal in character. The difficulty is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are not substitutable. <br><br>Apart from others the main cause of unemployment in Pakistan is the persistent deficiency of aggregate demand chiefly due to the lack of investment and relatively slow growth in exports. Thus ever increasing labour force and rather slow progression in AD has led to growing unemployment over a period of time.</li>
<li>The essence of the Keynesian model is that a country can lower demand deficient unemployment with sufficient injections of demand into the economy. An injection of money through multiplier effect leads to a multiple increase in national income. Prices will rise and employment will be increasing in order to meet the rising demand.<br><br>The government can maintain a high level of aggregate demand through expansionary fiscal policy. An expansionary or reflationary fiscal policy involves raising government expenditure and/or lowering taxes this will have the effect of either increasing the budget deficit or reducing the budget surplus. In this case the government may lower taxes in order to reduce the fall in disposable income. For unemployed, the government as part of welfare policy gives unemployment handouts. Both these measures at least help to keep demand from falling further.<br><br>On the expenditure side, the government maintains all public projects and obligations. The government may even embark on new public projects for the purpose of providing jobs in order to keep aggregate demand strong. With these measures the government actually alters the balance between government expenditure (G) and taxation (T), and thereby alters the balance between injections and withdrawals. In this way it controls aggregate demand. There will then be a multiplier effect as shown by the sequence below:<br><br>↑ G or ↓T→J &gt; W →↑ Y ⇒ ↑W until J = W <br><br>The eventual rise in aggregate demand and hence output would rise.<br>In the diagram below we see an increase in aggregate demand leading to an expansion of aggregate supply. Because of the increase in demand for output, the demand for labour at each wage rate will grow - leading to an increase in total employment.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/88f21da20e9849c5dc03d279a01ca4b9" alt="" width="495" height="206"><br><br>However fiscal policy is not the only method government can also use monetary policy to achieve the same results. On the monetary side, various quantitative and qualitative tools can be used in order to increase the money supply and lower interest rate. This will boost consumer expenditure and business investments. The central bank can lower its lending rate, buy up government securities and relax regulations on reserve ratios and special deposits. All controls on mortgage, deferred payments and hire purchases can be relaxed in order to stimulate demand. <br><br>In case of direct controls compulsory savings contributions by employees and employers can be reduced, the government can allow a lower age for compulsory pension funds withdrawals. The consumption of certain goods and services can be made compulsory. Examples are estate, cars and machinery maintenance must be done regularly.<br><br>So far as the real wage unemployment is concerned government can abolish the minimum wage or at least reduce it to the level where it will not affect the market wage rate. Also it can enact laws to curtail the powers of trade unions to set the price higher than the equilibrium wage rate. In order to deal with NRU government can take various steps.<br><br>In the long term, effective supply side policies can help reduce unemployment. Supply side policies are based on the belief that output economic growth and employment can be increased by raising aggregate supply. The view is that by allowing competitive market forces to operate, both households and firms will be motivated by financial rewards to supply their services. Thus supply side policies include a reduction in income tax, improvements in government retraining schemes and the reforms of both trade unions and the benefit system need to encourage.<br><br>These policies should aim to provide the unemployed with the skills they need to find re-employment and improve the incentives to find work. Structural unemployment is the result of workers being occupationally immobile - improvements in education and training will increase the human capital of these workers, and therefore give them a better chance of taking the new jobs that become available in the economy.<br><br>Improving the flow of information with regards to the availability of particular employment coupled with a reduction in unemployment benefit could reduce frictional unemployment. It could be argued that these measures will result in individuals spending less time in searching a job.&nbsp;<br><br>So, it can be concluded that fiscal policy is not the only measure to reduce unemployment. Government, in fact, can choose from a host of different measures in accordance with the causes of unemployment.</li>

<li>In times of uncertainty in an economy it is normal for individuals to become thrifty. It is therefore the case at macro level that an increase in savings by all individuals may actually lead to a fall in equilibrium level of national income and therefore to a reduction in savings. Following graph can be used to illustrate the paradox of thrift. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b999b3295265a7728879845b603014bd" alt="" width="385" height="201"><br><br>The graph relates to a four sector economy. The economy is initially in equilibrium at Y<sub>1</sub> where withdrawals equal injections. If all individual then seek to increase their saving, the withdrawals function will shift from W to W<sub>1</sub>. The increased thriftiness on the part of individuals will cause planned withdrawals to exceed planned injections by AB at the initial equilibrium level of national income Y<sub>1</sub>. Also, if everyone saves more as a consequence they spend less. Increased saving and low spending affects businesses. Less spending means less demand for goods and services and therefore lost orders for firms. Firms will cut back production and lay off workers. So the income of household will fall. <br><br>We know from the multiplier that the resulting fall in national income will be greater than the fall in spending because this means reduced injections into the economy as people spend less. As national income falls planned savings will also decline. Income will continue to fall until withdrawals once more equal planned injections and this occurs at national income Y<sub>2</sub>. Saving now will fall back to the initial level. Thus an attempt to save more will actually result in a fall in national income and a fall in saving to the same level. <br><br>Thus extra saving and less consumption would only make matters worse by lowering income and increasing unemployment. In fact if rising savings are not offset by increase in injections then national income is likely to decrease by a higher proportion due to the multiplier effect. <br>A rise in saving, for instance, could mean more funds available to lend which might result in a fall in interest rate. Lower interest rate may allow investment to rise and hence injections to increase thus offsetting the impact of reduction in saving. The following graph illustrates this; <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/739e4eea7396aa23ecf322da9303c326" alt="" width="409" height="210"><br><br>A rise in injections from J<sub>1</sub> to J<sub>2</sub> completely off sets the impact of rising saving and maintains equilibrium at Y<sub>1</sub> and the economy successfully escapes the paradox. Similarly a fall in demand resulting from a rise in saving may be compensated by a rise in exports or government may plan to increase its spending with the view to avoid a deficiency in AD at Y<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br>Therefore it follows that a paradox may develop when people become thrifty however there is a possibility that the level of injections rises and partially or completely offsets the effects of rise in saving.</li>
<li>Long run expansion of an economy's productive potential is known as potential growth while the percentage annual increase in a country's real GDP is actual growth. We define GDP as the monetary value of total output produced within the country over a twelve month period. The traditional PPC can be used to differentiate between actual and potential growth.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5d8954bfc0a239abb7a2255f9e244558" alt="" width="281" height="214"><br><br>Since PPC shows potential output of an economy therefore an outward shift in PPC reflects potential growth. This is achieved either by increasing supply of inputs or by improving their productivity. On the contrary a movement from a point inside PPC toward PPC is called actual growth. It results from an increase in aggregate demand (AD) that uses up the existing capacity and therefore results in an increase in real GDP.<br><br>Actual growth can be measured as:<br><br>Growth rate = (Change in real GDP)/(GDP previous year)&nbsp;× 100<br><br>An AD curve shows various amounts of goods and services (real output) that domestic consumers, businesses, government, and foreign buyers collectively desire to purchase at each possible price level. Thus AD is expressed as:<br>AD = C + I + G + X - M <br><br>Now an extra spending by either consumers or any other economic agent should increase firm's revenues, which could stimulate expenditure on investments and research. <br><br>This increase in spending would increase AD leading to a further increase in production and hence economic growth. This is illustrated on the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/75b031c37d048356eab9b4d197441da0" alt="" width="340" height="223"><br><br>Spending money on new purchases causes AD curve from AD to AD<sub>1</sub> leading to a rise in real GDP from Y to Y<sub>1</sub> and therefore reduces the level of unemployment. Sustained growth caused by rising aggregate demand, for instance, can lead to acceleration in inflation as the economy uses up scarce resources and short run aggregate supply becomes inelastic. When SRAS is elastic, an outward shift of aggregate demand can easily be met by a rise in real GDP as there is plenty of spare capacity and supply responds elastically to the higher level of AD. But when SRAS becomes inelastic, the trade-off between growth and inflation worsens - an increase in AD tends to lead to higher prices rather than increased output and employment. <br><br>Similarly a potential conflict exists between economic growth and trade balance. When aggregate demand is high and domestic producers are unable to meet all of this demand, the demand for imported goods and services will increase leading to an increase in the trade deficit. This trade-off is evident when the main source of rising AD is a high level of consumer spending. This suggests that if the government wants to reduce the trade deficit, then it must accept that consumer demand (and GDP) must eventually grow at a slower rate in order to reduce the imbalance between exports and imports. So it can be argued that extra spending might not always result in further output instead it may cause prices to increase along with an increase in imports with consequent effects on the balance of payments.</li>

<li>Wages or the price of labour, like other prices, are determined by economic factors. However, social and political factors also play a part in wage determination, as labour is a unique factor, being the human factor. <br><br>The main factor which determines the level of wages in a particular occupation is the interaction of demand for labour and supply of labour involved in that occupation. If demand is high for a category of labour then it is likely that wages will rise and vice versa. If supply of a certain category of labour is limited then, again, it is likely that wages will rise and vice versa. If labour was a homogeneous factor and was sold ina perfectly competitive labour markets, every person would earn the income in equilibrium. Disequilibrium differentials in wages would arise, but workers move from lower income to higher income jobs until the differentials had disappeared. In the real world, however, some workers scrape out a bare living, others earn modest but adequate incomes, while yet others earn enough to afford many of life's luxuries. <br><br>If a unit of labour produces a certain physical amount of a good which sells at a particular price (marginal revenue product) then the employer cannot afford to pay the worker a wage greater than the MRP. The MRP (which is a derived demand) is obtained from the product of MPP of labour and price of the product. Hence an improvement in the productivity of labour would increase the demand for labour; likewise, an increase in the price of the product will increase the demand for labour. Thus the demand for labour is greatly affected by the value of its MRP. The higher the MRP of labour the greater the demand for labour and the higher will be wages going to labour.<br><br>In the context of this question it can be said that MRP of sports people and top executive is high because people place a higher value to their services and therefore their output commands higher market price and in return they earn higher wages. Take the case of a footballer. He is valued because of the talent that he displays on the pitch, and because of his ability to bring in the crowds who want to see him play. This makes him a good revenue earner for his club, and reflects his marginal productivity. In addition his skills are rare-some would say unique. Also the demand for his services is inelastic because his services cannot be substituted with other factors. At the same time supply of footballers is extremely limited. This is because the level of skills required to be a professional footballer is relatively rare and it requires strenuous training to become one. The combination of higher marginal productivity combined with inelastic demand and limited supply leads to a high equilibrium wage. <br><br>In case of top executives again the supply is relatively inelastic, at least in the short run. The education and training required to become an executive is long and demanding and is certainly essential for entry into an occupation. Furthermore not everyone is cut out to become an executive as this is the field that requires certain abilities and talents. This implies that the supply of executives is limited and does not vary a great deal with the wage rate. In this case their earnings are largely made up of economic rent.<br><br>Thus we conclude that it is the high demand and relatively limited supply of footballers and top executives that leads to relatively high equilibrium wage rate in the market.</li>
<li>Although economic theory of wage determination assumes a perfectly competitive market, however, the theory could be extended to allow various real world market imperfections. There may be, for instance, a single buyer of labour- a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory is the main source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, then the wage rate, (AC<sub>L</sub>) is no longer represented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the wage rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence, monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market supply curve and in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the size of an employer's demand for labour will affect the wage rate. This is illustrated in the figure below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/703e63effd6a06e7d56e6b4977660d62" alt="" width="371" height="239"><br><br>The higher MC<sub>L</sub> than AC<sub>L</sub> can be explained by the use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £ 100, 50 workers may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to employ one more worker he is forced to offer £101, the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now £ 101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid to the 51 st worker plus £ 1 paid to each of the 50 original workers.<br><br>Similar to the perfect market a monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ where its MC<sub>L</sub> equals MRP<sub>L</sub>, indicated by point A in the graph, hence L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate W<sub>1</sub>, however, is given by the S curve (AC<sub>L</sub>). In a perfectly competitive non-rnonopsony market the wage and numbers being employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively.T hus monopsony power in a labour market will result in a lower level of employment and lower wages than would exist in a competitive labour market. Thus it is believed that imperfect markets leads to exploitation. However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment can be corrected by incorporating government intervention.<br><br>However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment can be corrected without government intervention simply by incorporating trade unions. A trade union could seek to resist the wage decrease of their members by either restricting the supply of labour or by direct negotiation. They can restrict the supply of labour through the use of a closed shop or by lengthening the time it takes to complete an apprenticeship. Over a period of time this could reduce the supply of labour to an industry, shifting the supply curve from SL<sub>1</sub> to SL<sub>2</sub> shown in the figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/44a968d63303083dfbb3b17155bad34e" alt="" width="329" height="235"><br><br>The result would be an increase in the wage rate from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>, but with a reduced number employed, i.e. L<sub>2</sub> instead of L<sub>1</sub>.<br><br>Alternatively, trade unions can influence the market through collective bargaining. It involves the direct negotiation between a trade union, bargaining collectively on behalf of its members, and the employer(s). <br><br>Suppose that the workers in an industry organize themselves under a single union so that the monopsonist employer now faces a monopoly union - a bilateral monopoly. In this case the two sides will settle the wage through collective bargaining. The outcome of bargaining depends on the objective and strength of each side. <br><br>When government intervenes in a labour market it fixes the minimum wage above the market wage rate. The minimum wage is a pay floor. Employers are not allowed o pay their employees a rate below the minimum wage. The outcome of minimum wage is illustrated on the graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/540ef81f044c73ddc6fe2adbd54bd27c" alt="" width="358" height="250"><br><br>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. The government then sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, which will kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal cost curve of labour. <br><br>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub> workers. <br><br>Following a minimum wage fixed by the government, not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually employs more workers. It is only when the minimum wage is fixed above W<sub>3</sub> that employment starts to fall. <br><br>Thus government intervention is not the only solution to deal with the exploitation of workers in an imperfectly competitive labour market. It can also be addressed by increasing the powers of trade unions to fix the wage rate at a higher level.</li>

When economists use the term efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. In other words allocative efficiency occurs when the consumer valuation (P) of a product equals the cost of resources (marginal cost) used up in its production. Thus the condition required for allocative efficiency is P =MC. When this happens economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/4ae8c693874edbde79b8cc48b07b6229" alt="" width="247" height="189"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS, producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium in the market implies P = MC, hence generating maximum possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus. A situation where either P &gt; MC or P &lt; MC implies inefficient allocation of resources. Following graph illustrates these cases.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/0c99266f4988157fbb2676cf01029dc9" alt="" width="262" height="183"></p>
<p>At an output of 100 units P &gt; MC and, therefore, it indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC. So an increase in output up to 200 units would increase both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A and hence would improve allocative efficiency. On the other hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have been allocated for production. In the graph above the production of 300 units, for instance, suggests over allocation of resources. The shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of consumer and producer surplus from the alternative product. Therefore, net gains can be realized until production is reduced to 200 units. Thus it follows that the resources are efficiently allo-cated to produce a product when its output is such that its price equals marginal cost.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firm's costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize the wastage of resources i.e when they produce a product using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/ab98306618907f14dda36e7717904a43" alt="" width="252" height="178"></p>
<p>AC<sub>3</sub>, in the figure indicates productive efficiency. This means that the lowest possible cost techniques of production are being used to produce different levels of output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per unit cost hence suggest productive inefficiency. Furthermore, the firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when production occurs at the lowest point (z) on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the term technical efficiency for this point.</p>
<p>The traditional theory of firm holds that firms pursue the goal of profit maximization. This can be achieved when the firm is producing at an output where the positive difference between total revenues and total costs is the greatest. Alternatively it can also be analyzed using marginal concept. Thus the firm earns maximum possible profit where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). MC is the cost of producing one extra unit while MR is the revenue earned from selling an extra unit.&nbsp; MC production of each next unit increases the firm's profit and therefore it maximizes profit when its output reaches where MC= MR. If ouput expands beyond this then MR? MC that means the cost of producing an extra unit is higher than the revenue earned from its sale. It, therefore, reduces firm's total profit. Thus it follows that the firm, in order to earn highest possible profit, tends to expand output to the level where its MR = MC.</p>
<p>The direct link between efficiency and profit levels depends on the type of market. The theory of firm predicts that each firm in a perfectly competitive market maximses profit when it produces at the lowest point on its LRAC curve and it is not possible for any one firm to reduce its cost any further by altering its output. Every firm in perfect competition, therefore, is productively efficient. This is shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/aabcf9f40257ca973d234fa952f7284c" alt="" width="315" height="168"></p>
<p>A perfectly competitive firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve (AR = MR) and its MC intersects MR at point 'e' therefore its profit maximizing output is qp where it achieves both the highest possible profit and productive efficiency. It can also be analyzed that at the same output level the firm equates marginal cost and price. Thus, when perfect competition is the market structure for the whole economy, price equals marginal cost in each line of production results in allocative efficiency. Therefore in case of perfect competition firms should be encouraged to maximize profit in order to achieve greater efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the contrary, a profit maximizing firm operating under imperfect market condition faces a downward sloping demand (AR) curve and its MR curve lies below this. Under such conditions a firm maximizes profits at an output (q) where its MC = MR. However at this output level price exceeds marginal cost, therefore results in an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. Also the firm produces at the decreasing part of LRAC curve, it is, therefore, productively inefficient. The higher average cost in production means that the firm is not making optimum use of scarce resources.</p>
<p>So, from the comparison of perfect and imperfect market we conclude that the assertion the higher the profit the greater the efficiency proves right in case of perfect market. However, in case of imperfect markets it does not hold true.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 31</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9530</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In 2011, one of the UKs' largest multinational banks announced it would reduce the number of people it employed by 43000 - the equivalent size of a small town.

<li>Unemployment is defined as people who are out of work but, have actively looked for a job over a certain period of time. Unemployment can be expressed as a number or a percentage. Unemployment rate is the percentage of the workforce that is unemployed. The work force can be defined as those who are employed and unemployed. <br><br>Cyclical unemployment is involuntary unemployment due to a lack of aggregate demand for goods and services. This is also known as Keynesian "demand deficient" unemployment and is associated with the transition of the economy through the business cycle. When there is an economic recession we expect to see a rising level of unemployment because of plant closures and worker layoffs. This is due to a fall in demand leading to a contraction in output across many industries. <br><br>Although demand deficient unemployment is usually associated with economic recessions it can also exist in the long run when the economy is constantly run below capacity. As the economy recovers from a downturn, we expect to see the problem of cyclical unemployment decline. The concept can be illustrated on the following graph showing AD ＆ AS. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a84b227c45e9b4f8bdbb51950b41583a" alt="" width="360" height="261"><br><br>A fall in aggregate demand from AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub> results in a decrease in national income from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub> and as such there is an increase in the numbers employed. Labour, after all, is a derived demand, derived from the demand for the good that is being produced. So, if there is a fall in the demand for products in the goods market then the demand for labour will fall causing unemployment. Consider the following graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b3ae3010e022f3c966998378e534c628" alt="" width="423" height="310"><br><br>In the diagram we see that the equilibrium wage is W<sub>1</sub> giving a level of employment of L<sub>1</sub>. Keynesians argue that in times of recession, the aggregate demand curve for the economy as a whole shifts to the left. This causes the demand for labour curve to shift to the left as well (from D<sub>L1</sub> to D<sub>L2</sub>). If the real wage rate stays at W<sub>1</sub> then there will be L<sub>1</sub> -L<sub>2</sub> workers involuntarily unemployed. <br><br>Of course, the classical economists would argue that the real wage rate would fall to the new equilibrium (wage W<sub>2</sub>, employment L<sub>3</sub>). The level of employment would fall (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>3</sub>) but there would be no involuntary unemployment. Keynes argued that this would not necessarily happen because wages and prices are 'sticky downwards'. Even if the real wage rate falls, the lower incomes of the workers would lead to lower spending in the economy, a further reduction in aggregate demand and a further reduction in the demand for labour. So, it is held that the government can use macro-economic policies to increase the level of aggregate demand. These policies might involve lower interest rates or lower direct taxes. It might also encourage foreign investment into the economy from foreign multinational companies. <br><br>On the other hand classical economists believe that the causes of increase in unemployment fall into two broad categories: Equilibrium unemployment (NRU) and disequilibrium unemployment (real wage unemployment). Real wage unemployment or classical unemployment is where trade unions use their monopoly power to derive wages above the market clearing level resulting in an excess supply of labour. Governments introducing minimum wage legislation could also cause it. Consider the following graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5689fbe3808533bfd0887b6f40cc6e02" alt="" width="366" height="274"><br><br>If a real wage (w<sub>2</sub>) is fixed above the equilibrium real wage (we) then the result is an excess supply of labour equal to q<sub>3</sub> - q<sub>1,</sub> real wage unemployment. <br>Even when there is no general disequilibrium in the economy at the current wage levels, there will still be some unemployment. This is known as the natural rate of unemployment. For various reasons not all vacancies will be filled. The problem is one of the mismatching. There are various types of equilibrium unemployment. <br><br>Frictional unemployment is transitional unemployment due to people moving between jobs. For example, newly redundant workers or workers entering the labour market for instance, university graduates, may take time to find appropriate jobs at wage rates they are prepared to accept. Thus, many are unemployed for a short time whilst involved in job search. Imperfect information in the labour market may make frictional unemployment worse if the jobless are unaware of the available employment opportunities. <br><br>Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand or supply in the economy. People made redundant in one part of the economy due to a long run decline in demand in particular industries cannot immediately take up jobs in other parts or other industries. Hence, structural unemployment increases when there is a growing mismatch between their skills and the requirements of the new job opportunities. <br><br>Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for certain types of labour fluctuates with the seasons of the year. For instance, employment in fruit picking and holiday catering is seasonal in character. The difficulty is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are not substitutable. <br><br>Hence it follows that there are several causes of increase in unemployment. However, in the long term, effective policies to reduce the total level of unemployment need to encourage an improvement in the employability of the labour supply. These may require some reforms of the tax and benefits system, a sustained period of economic growth and improving skills and reducing occupational immobility.</li>
<li>Most economists agree that high levels of unemployment are costly not only to the individuals and families directly affected, but also to local and regional economies and the economy as a whole. We can make a distinction between the economic costs arising from people out of work and the social costs that often result.<br><br>Unemployment causes a waste of scarce economic resources and reduces the long run growth potential of the economy. An economy with high unemployment is producing within its production possibility frontier. The hours that the unemployed do not work can never be recovered. Consider the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ae0f8b6b419fbc300b16d80fcc75ea02" alt="" width="402" height="300"><br><br>The existence of any idle resources means that the economy will be at a point within its production possibility frontier, point D for instance. However, all points on the PPC suggest that the economy could have produced more goods and services which would then have been available for consumption. So there is a loss of output which those workers now unemployed could have produced had they been in work. Also if unemployment can be reduced, total national output can rise leading to an improvement in economic welfare. Thus there is the cost to the whole economy in terms of wasted, unused resources leading to a lower living standard.<br><br>Besides this, high unemployment has an impact on government expenditure, taxation and the level of government borrowing each year. An increase in unemployment results in higher benefit payments and lower tax revenues. When individuals are unemployed, not only do they receive benefits but also pay no income tax. As they are spending less they contribute less to the government in indirect taxes. This rise in government spending along with the fall in tax revenues may result in a higher government borrowing requirement leading to a rise in national debt.<br><br>Unemployment wastes some of the scarce resources used in training workers. Furthermore, workers who are unemployed for long periods become deskilled as their skills become increasingly outdated in a rapidly changing job market. This reduces their chances of gaining employment in the future, which in turn increases the economic burden on government and society.<br><br>Rising unemployment is also linked to social and economic deprivation - there is some relationship between&nbsp;rising unemployment and rising crime and worsening social dislocation such as increased divorce, worsening health and lower life expectancy. Areas of high unemployment will also see a decline in real income and spending together with a rising scale of relative poverty and income inequality. As younger workers are more geographically mobile than older employees, there is a risk that areas with above average unemployment will suffer from an ageing potential workforce - making them less attractive as investment locations for new businesses.&nbsp;<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that unemployment carries substantial economic and social costs. These costs are greatest when long-term structural unemployment is high. Indeed many governments focus their labour market policies on improving the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed. However government needs to take an active management of the macro economy on both demand and supply sides in order to avoid costs of unemployment in general.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">In India, until the late 1990s the Government held a monopoly on all types of telecommunication (telecom). The industry had a small-sized market. In the twenty-first century the industry switched to private sector ownership. The telecom industry then experienced rapid growth, less restrictive regulations, greater technological developments, reduced costs of equipment and competition. Telecom became one of the major contributors to India's economic growth and one of the fastestgrowing industries in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it was in the public sector, the telecom industry recorded only a marginal increase in customers - on average 1.92% a year. After privatisation and the relaxation of regulations, the annual increase reached 36.9% in 2009. By 2009 India was second in the world only to China in terms of wireless network customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The industry emerged as crucial to India's economic growth because of its multiplier effect and the fact that it is beneficial to other industries. The contribution of the industry to India's GDP has more than doubled to 2.83% in 2007 from 1.0% in 1992.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Much of this growth was caused by a large increase in cell (mobile) phone customers which grew at a rapid rate from 10 million in 2002 to 392 million in 2009. There is a direct correlation between the growth in cell phone customers and the growth in GDP per capita in developing countries, which tend to have a high percentage of the population living in rural areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Indian telecom industry now has intense competition and continuous price wars from a growing number of telecom service providers. <br>The government has been applying suitable fiscal and promotional policies to boost domestic demand to help Indian firms.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f0bfac77770238c621d3459c3fbfa23f" alt="" width="577" height="359"><br><br>Table 1: The significance of the Telecom Industry to India</p>

<li>GDP at factor cost refers to total income earned by individuals in a country therefore it does not include indirect taxes that are part of market prices. However GDP at factor cost includes subsidies that are not part of GDP at market prices. These differences can be corrected as: GDP<sub>F</sub> (at factor cost) - subsidies + indirect taxes = GDP<sub>M</sub> (at market Prices). In order to obtain GDP<sub>F</sub> from GDP<sub>M&nbsp;</sub>we reverse the equation.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Economic theory predicts that a change in injection or withdrawals causes a proportionately larger change in national income through what is known as a multiplier effect. In a four sector economy the size of multiplier is measured by the reciprocal of marginal propensity to withdrawals (MPW). Hence the formula of multiplier can be written as:<br><br>K = 1/(MPS+ MPT + MPM) or 1/(MPW)<br>Thus if the MPS is 0.15, the MPT 0.25 and the MPM 0.10, then the value of multiplier would be: <br>K = 1/(0.15+0.25+0.10) or 1/0.5 = 2<br>So, an increase in investment of $40bn, for instance, would increase national income by $80 bn.</li>
<li>As a catalyst Indian telecom industry aided Indian economy a great deal to achieve high growth rate. Its own contribution to Indian GDP more than doubled in fifteen years. Not only has this but the industry helped the government to raise higher tax revenues. As a direct benefit the telecom sector remained instrumental in creating jobs for a vast pool of talented and qualified professionals in the IT and other related industries, which thrive on reliable telecommunication infrastructure. India, for instance, has become an important outsourcing destination for the world and the boom in this sector also has transformed India's economic dynamics.<br><br>Telecom industry in India has emerged as a key infrastructure for economic and consumer growth because of its multiplier effect and the fact that it is beneficial to trade in other industries. Therefore other businesses must have benefitted in terms of lower transaction costs and a better access to information. Besides this an improvement in telecom industry must have improved services such as banking, health care and education eventually improving the quality of services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The assessment of success requires value judgment. However if success of an industry is related to maximizing economic benefits then the Indian telecom industry seems on its way to achieving it. A large part of Information provided in the question supports this view. <br><br>According to the information provided liberalisation of the telecom industry in India fuelled intense competition, especially in the cellular segment. The ever-increasing competition led to high growth of subscribers and put pressure on tariffs, which had seen a sharp drop over the years. Increased competition and the subsequent tariff war had acted as a major catalyst for attracting more subscribers. This resulted in an increase in investment that led to an expansion of networking and a wider coverage area. <br><br>However the success is not only the result of competition. Other factors also contributed to the success. Availability of cheaper handsets, for instance, encouraged people to buy cell phones and therefore make use of telecom services. Improvement in technology also made it possible to widen the networking and tap the markets in rural and remote areas. Furthermore, global networking resulted in a widespread usage of telecom services for quick data transfers. At the same time government also used fiscal measures to support the industry. These and other factors such as increase in population and affordability due to higher incomes might have contributed to this exponential success of the industry. <br><br>So, only competition in the industry cannot be credited for its success. In fact the industry benefitted from an overall more conducive economic environment for its growth.</li>

Discuss this opinion.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Owing to the basic economic problem of scarce resources and unlimited wants, all societies must make choices. These choices involve allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses to achieve given ends. Resources are typically called factors of production. They include land, labour, capital and enterprise.</p>
<p>These are all inputs used in the production of all those goods and services that we want.</p>
<p>A market system is associated with the capitalist ideology where all resources are privately owned. Hence all economic decisions are made by individual households and firms who act in their own self interest. The essence of a market system is price mechanism, often quoted as "invisible hand". Operating on its own, without government intervention, price mechanism allocates resources through million of decisions taken each day by consumers and businesses. This system operates through signaling where a rise or fall in prices eliminates shortages and surpluses. This means that market prices will automatically adjust to where resources are required and where they are not required. Thus resources are allocated and reallocated according to the preferences of consumers and therefore consumers are said to be sovereign. So it is believed that apparently chaotic system of millions of transactions would not only allocate resources but it would do it efficiently.</p>
<p>Efficiency, on the other hand, generally relates to how well an economy uses its scarce resources to satisfy maximum wants of consumers. When economists use the term efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. In other words allocative efficiency occurs when the consumer valuation (P) of a product equals the cost of resources (marginal cost) used up in its production. Thus the condition required for allocative efficiency is P = MC. When this happens economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a08ccdc85de3e461963a4891bc043d86" alt="" width="271" height="202"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS, producing an output Oq at price OP. So the equilibrium in the market implies P = MC, hence generating maximum possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus. A situation where either P &gt; MC or P &lt; MC implies inefficient allocation of resources. Following graph illustrates these cases.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1f83277bb7328aeac86dff96cfbea09d" alt="" width="277" height="184"></p>
<p>At an output of I 00 units P &gt; MC and, therefore, it indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC. So an increase in output up to 200 units would increase both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A and hence would improve allocative efficiency. On the other hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have been allocated for production. In the graph above the production of 300 units, for instance, suggests over allocation of resources. The shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of consumer and producer surplus from the alternative product. Therefore net gains can be realized until production can be reduced to 200 units. Thus it follows that the resources are efficiently allocated to produce a product when its output is such that its price equals marginal cost.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize the wastage of resources i.e. when they produce a product using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/ff40c33ac4890e4fd14f93d59b5f1fb9" alt="" width="280" height="194"></p>
<p>In the figure above AC<sub>3</sub> indicates productive efficiency. This means that the lowest possible cost techniques of production are being used to produce different level of output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per unit cost hence suggest productive inefficiency. Furthermore, the firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when production occurs at the lowest point indicated by point z on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the term technical efficiency for this point.</p>
<p>The theory of firm predicts that each firm in a perfectly competitive market produces at the lowest point on its LRAC curve and it is not possible for any one firm to reduce its cost any further by altering its output. Every firm in perfect competition is therefore productively efficient. This is shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/0e49ff7b6bf8cefc3b20ddbcfbb00b58" alt="" width="394" height="258"></p>
<p>It can be analyzed from the graph that perfectly competitive firms maximize profits by equating marginal cost to price. Thus, when perfect competition is the market structure for the whole economy, price is equal to marginal cost in each line of production resulting in allocative efficiency.</p>
<p>On the contrary, a profit maximizing firm operating under imperfect market conditions the firm will maximize profits at an output ( q) where price exceeds marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. Also the firm produces at the decreasing part of AC curve, it is, therefore, productively inefficient. The higher average cost in production means that the firm is not making optimum use of scarce resources. Thus under these conditions, market fails to achieve economic efficiency and therefore may be a case for government intervention through competition policy or market regulation.</p>
<p>In other cases market failure exists when even the competitive outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. The result is a loss of economic and social welfare generally known as social inefficiency. This&nbsp;is usually because the benefits that the free market confers on individuals or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits to the society as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The existence of externalities, for instance, causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer benefits on others that are not involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem created by externalities is that market forces will lead to either too little or too much production. With a positive externality, a competitive free market will produce too little of the good and with a negative externality it produces too much of the good. Thus the presence of externalities, even when all markets are perfectly competitive, leads to allocatively inefficient outcomes.</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto the other party. The other party loses because they do not have the same information. More generally, whenever either party to a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency. <br>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information. Consumers do not perceive quite well how well or bad is a particular product for them: either they do not have the right information or they simply lack some relevant information. The problem is that imperfect information causes market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of merit and demerit goods being produced or consumed.</p>
<p>A distinct type of market failure exists in case of public goods. The issue here is not over and under allocation but weather resources are allocated at all. A good must possess three distinguishing characteristics to qualify as public goods. It must be non-excludable, non-rival and non-rejectable. These features give rise to the free rider problem; people receiving benefits from a good without contributing to its cost. Thus it develops a situation in which everyone believes that others will take on the burden of paying for goods such as national defense and streetlights. Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive to supply them. So we have goods which yield substantial benefits but to which the market system fails to allocate resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion it can be stated that market system though allocates resources efficiently in most cases yet it fails to achieve socially desirable outcome in certain situations known as market failures. Thus there is a justified economic role for government. However, government intervention in excess of market failure could hamper the efficient role of markets and therefore create further inefficiencies.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 34</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9506</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In 2011, one of the UKs' largest multinational banks announced it would reduce the number of people it employed by 43000 - the equivalent size of a small town.

<li>Unemployment is defined as people who are out of work but, have actively looked for a job over a certain period of time. Unemployment can be expressed as a number or a percentage. Unemployment rate is the percentage of the work force that is unemployed. The work force can be defined as those who are employed and unemployed. <br><br>Cyclical unemployment is involuntary unemployment due to a lack of aggregate demand for goods and services. This is also known as Keynesian "demand deficient" unemployment and is associated with the transition of the economy through the business cycle. When there is an economic recession we expect to see a rising level of unemployment because of plant closures and worker layoffs. This is due to a fall in demand leading to a contraction in output across many industries. <br><br>Although demand deficient unemployment is usually associated with economic recessions it can also exist in the long run when the economy is constantly run below capacity. As the economy recovers from a downturn, we expect to see the problem of cyclical unemployment decline. The concept can be illustrated on the following graph showing AD ＆ AS. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a84b227c45e9b4f8bdbb51950b41583a" alt="" width="340" height="247"><br><br>A fall in aggregate demand from AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub> results in a decrease in national income from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub> and as such there is an increase in the numbers employed. Labour, after all, is a derived demand, derived from the demand for the good that is being produced. So, if there is a fall in the demand for products in the goods market then the demand for labour will fall causing unemployment. Consider the following graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b3ae3010e022f3c966998378e534c628" alt="" width="388" height="284"><br><br>In the diagram we see that the equilibrium wage is W<sub>1</sub> giving a level of employment of L<sub>1</sub>. Keynesians argue that in times of recession, the aggregate demand curve for the economy as a whole shifts to the left. This causes the demand for labour curve to shift to the left as well (from D<sub>L1</sub> to D<sub>L2</sub>). If the real wage rate stays at W<sub>1</sub> then there will be L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>2</sub> workers involuntarily unemployed. <br><br>Of course, the classical economists would argue that the real wage rate would fall to the new equilibrium (wage W<sub>2</sub>, employment L<sub>3</sub>). The level of employment would fall (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>3</sub>) but there would be no involuntary unemployment. Keynes argued that this would not necessarily happen because wages and prices are 'sticky downwards'. Even if the real wage rate falls, the lower incomes of the workers would lead to lower spending in the economy, a further reduction in aggregate demand and a further reduction in the demand for labour. So, it is held that the government can use macro-economic policies to increase the level of aggregate demand. These policies might involve lower interest rates or lower direct taxes. It might also encourage foreign investment into the economy from foreign multinational companies. <br><br>On the other hand classical economists believe that the causes of increase in unemployment fall into two broad categories: Equilibrium unemployment (NRU) and disequilibrium unemployment (real wage unemployment). Real wage unemployment or classical unemployment is where trade unions use their monopoly power to derive wages above the market clearing level resulting in an excess supply of labour. Governments introducing minimum wage legislation could also cause it. Consider the following graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5689fbe3808533bfd0887b6f40cc6e02" alt="" width="341" height="255"><br><br>If a real wage (w<sub>2</sub>) is fixed above the equilibrium real wage (we) then the result is an excess supply of labour equal to q<sub>3</sub> - q<sub>1</sub> real wage unemployment. <br>Even when there is no general disequilibrium in the economy at the current wage levels, there will still be some unemployment. This is known as the natural rate of unemployment. For various reasons not all vacancies will be filled. The problem is one of the mismatching. There are various types of equilibrium unemployment. <br><br>Frictional unemployment is transitional unemployment due to people moving between jobs: For example, newly redundant workers or workers entering the labour market for instance, university graduates, may take time to find appropriate jobs at wage rates they are prepared to accept. Thus, many are unemployed for a short time whilst involved in job search. Imperfect information in the labour market may make frictional unemployment worse if the jobless are unaware of the available employment opportunities. <br><br>Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand or supply in the economy. People made redundant in one part of the economy due to a long run decline in demand in particular industries cannot immediately take up jobs in other parts or other industries. Hence, structural unemployment increases when there is a growing mismatch between their skills and the requirements of the new job opportunities. <br><br>Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for certain types of labour fluctuates with the seasons of the year. For instance, employment in fruit picking and holiday catering is seasonal in character. The difficulty is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are not substitutable. <br>Hence it follows that there are several causes of increase in unemployment. However, in the long term, effective policies to reduce the total level of unemployment need to encourage an improvement in the employability of the labour supply. These may require some reforms of the tax and benefits system, a sustained period of economic growth and improving skills and reducing occupational immobility.</li>
<li>Most economists agree that high levels of unemployment are costly not only to the individuals and families directly affected, but also to local and regional economies and the economy as a whole. We can make a distinction between the economic costs arising from people out of work and the social costs that often result in lost output of goods and services.<br>Unemployment causes a waste of scarce economic resources and reduces the long run growth potential of the economy. An economy with high unemployment is producing within its production possibility frontier. The hours that the unemployed do not work can never be recovered. Consider the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ae0f8b6b419fbc300b16d80fcc75ea02" alt="" width="400" height="298"><br><br>The existence of any idle resources means that the economy will be at a point within its production possibility frontier, point D for instance. However, all points on the PPC suggest that the economy could have produced more goods and services which would then have been available for consumption. So there is a loss of output which those workers now unemployed could have produced had they been in work. Also if unemployment can be reduced, total national output can rise leading to an improvement in economic welfare. Thus there is the cost to the whole economy in terms of wasted, unused resources, leading to a lower living standard.<br><br>Besides this, high unemployment has an impact on government expenditure, taxation and the level of government borrowing each year. An increase in unemployment results in higher benefit payments and lower tax revenues. When individuals are unemployed, not only do they receive benefits but also pay no income tax. As they are spending less they contribute less to the government in indirect taxes. This rise in government spending along with the fall in tax revenues may result in a higher government borrowing requirement leading to a rise in national debt.<br><br>Unemployment wastes some of the scarce resources used in training workers. Furthermore, workers who are unemployed for long periods become deskilled as their skills become increasingly outdated in a rapidly changing job market. This reduces their chances of gaining employment in the future, which in turn increases the economic burden on government and society.<br><br>Rising unemployment is also linked to social and economic deprivation - there is some relationship between&nbsp;rising unemployment and rising crime and worsening social dislocation such as increased divorce, worsening health and lower life expectancy. Areas of high unemployment will also see a decline in real income and spending together with a rising scale of relative poverty and income inequality. As younger workers are more geographically mobile than older employees, there is a risk that areas with above average unemployment will suffer from an ageing potential workforce - making them less attractive as investment locations for new businesses.&nbsp;<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that unemployment carries substantial economic and social costs. These costs are greatest when long-term structural unemployment is high. Indeed many governments focus their labour market policies on improving the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed. However government needs to take an active management of the macro economy on both demand and supply sides in order to avoid costs of unemployment in general.</li>

These low levels of living are manifested quantitatively and qualitatively in the form of low incomes (poverty), inadequate housing, poor health, limited education, high infant mortality, low life and work expectancies, and in many cases a general sense of malaise and hopelessness. On the other hand in developed economies high levels of living is reflected by high per capita income, mass education, adequate housing and health facilities for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>Also, developing economies differ from developed economies in their size and composition of GDP. In 2000, GDP of all the nations of the world was valued at more than U.S. $31 trillion, of which almost $25 trillion originated in the economically developed regions and less than $7 trillion was generated in the less developed nations. When one takes account of the distribution of world population, this means that over 90% of the world's income is produced in the economically developed regions by 15% of the world's people. Thus the remaining 85% of the world's population is living on only one-fifth of total world income. <br>So far as the composition of GDP is concerned, tertiary sector contributes the largest proportion to GDP in the developed economies followed by secondary and then primary sector. Their manufacturing and construction are geared towards high value products and structures. In contrast to this, most developing economies are oriented toward the production of primary products (agriculture, fuel, forestry, and raw materials) as opposed to secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (service) activities. These primary commodities form their main exports to other nations. Their manufacturing sector comprises of small scale cottage industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the technology in developed economies is extremely advanced. They are now venturing into genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. On the contrary, developing economies lack indigenous technology and therefore import capital equipments from the developed countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed economies have extensive infrastructure with highly developed means of transportation and communication. The workers in these countries are better trained and more productive due to the higher health standards and high capital-labour ratio. Whereas, developing countries usually have poor infrastructure, old means of transportation and communication, frequently interrupted supplies of power, water and gas. Productivity of workers in these economies is low mainly due to low health standards, poor training and low-capital labour ratio.</p>
<p>Population of developed economies is small relative to their GNP. They also have much lower birth rate and a longer life expectancy. Their population composition is made up of a larger middle and old age group relative to the young. The literacy rate is usually close to 100% if not 100%. In contrast to this, size of the population in developing economies is high relative to their GNP. Due to the high rate of population growth the proportion of young is relatively high than middle and old people, thus the age structure makes a pyramid. Their general literacy rate is low and the proportion of people with higher education is even lower.</p>
<p>So far as the dependence of developed countries on international trade is concerned, certain raw materials, capital equipments and intermediate products that are necessary for development can be obtained only from abroad. Since these countries lack indigenous technology, therefore they are dependent on international trade for much needed capital goods required for their development. Developed countries also depend on international trade to a large extent. They need to import raw materials to produce finished goods in order to meet high domestic demand. Also developed countries need overseas markets in order to realize their huge productive potential.</p>
<p>Similarly, being developed means high cost of living and loss of competitiveness in many of its traditional industries. It is for these reasons the developed countries often have to deal with the rising structural unemployment. Thus a developed country faces the difficult task of discovering and developing new industrial avenues that involve heavy expenditure on research and development and retraining of its labour force. This may be difficult, particularly, if the labour force is inflexible and immobile.</p>
<p>A major problem arises when the economy starts incurring trade deficit. This is partly due to the higher value of the exchange rate and partly due to the direct relationship between income and preferences of imported goods. This drains the country's reserves and creates unemployment as demand for the local goods falls within the economy and abroad.</p>
<p>However in developing countries there is vast unemployment and disguised unemployment due to the economy failing to expand with the growth of labour force. Generally large numbers of workers are prepared to work but they are unable to find work due to the lack of man power planning.</p>
<p>Thus it follows that dependence on international trade and the existence of unemployment are not typical features of either developing or developed countries. Thus If a country is to be classified as developed or developing we need to consider statistics on a host of other quantitative and qualitative factors.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 36</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9500</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what changes might occur to the age distribution and occupational structure of a population as an economy changes from developing to developed.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Development economics classifies different economies into developed and developing economies. The former refers to economically advanced and technologically independent countries while latter can be further classified into underdeveloped, undeveloped and newly industrialized economy. Though all of them are broadly classified as developing economies but differentiated development will exist among them. Generally developing countries are characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technological dependence on developed economies. <br>The population structure of a country is how it is made up of people of different ages, and of males and females. <br><br>Developing countries differ greatly in age structure of their population from those of developed countries. The typical population pyramid of a developing country is wide at the base, which means there are a large proportion of young people in the country. It tapers very quickly as we go up into the older age groups, and is narrow at the top. This shows that a very small proportion of people are elderly. The wide base of pyramid is attributed to the high population growth potential characterized by high birth rate. An important consequence of high birthrate in developing countries is that a larger proportion is in younger age group. The pyramid tapers quickly as we move up due to high infant mortality rate. The percentage of population under 15 years of age is about 40 in developing countries compared with only 25 in developed countries. Moreover 90% of the dependants are children in developed countries whereas their percentage is 66 in developed countries. Being narrow at the middle and top, the pyramid simply reflects a shorter life expectancy which means a smaller fraction of their population available as an effective labourf orce.A veragel ife expectancya t birth is roughly 51 years whereas it ,is over 75 in developed countries. <br><br>So, when the country changes its status from developing to developed, its population pyramid would become narrow at the base, wider in the middle and it would remain wider until the very top, as there would be a sizable percentage of older people. The narrow base would reflectc hanges in life style and social values leading to lower birth rate. Wider middle and top would suggest a decrease in infant mortality rate and an increase in average life expectancy usually resulting from higher standards of health care. Thus the ratio of dependent population could rise due to the aging population and the country might have smaller proportion of population working to support a growing aging population.<br><br>Employment structure means how the workforce is divided up between the three main employment sectors - primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary jobs involve getting raw materials from the natural environment e.g. mining, farming and fishing. Secondary jobs involve manufacturing e.g. making cars and steel. Tertiary jobs involve providing a service e.g. teaching and nursing.<br><br>In contrast to developed countries, most developing economies are oriented toward the production of primary products (agriculture, fuel, forestry, and raw materials) as opposed to secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (service) activities. Vast majority of people in developing countries lives and works in rural areas. Over 65% are rurally based, compared to less than 27% in economicallyd eveloped countries. Similarly,on average, 58% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture, compared to only 5% in developed nations. Agriculture contributes about 14 % of the total output of developing nations but only 3% of the GNP of developed nations Thus primary sector employs a relatively higher proportion of the labour force in developing countries. Their manufacturing sector comprises of small scale cottage&nbsp;industry providing limited employment opportunities and the tertiary sector employs the least of the total labour force.&nbsp;<br><br>So when a country becomes developed its manufacturing and construction are geared towards high value products and structures leading to the largest proportion of labour force employed in tertiary sector followed by secondary and then primary sector. <br><br>From the above it can be concluded that the age and employment structure of population changes to a large extent when a developing country becomes developed.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 37</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9498</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The combination of rapid economic growth and inflation is no coincidence.</p>
<p>Discuss what policies might be used by a government to control inflation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Inflation is defined as a persistent increase in general price level. Owing to its negative impact on the economy controlling inflation has become one of the dominant objectives of government economic policy in modern world. Effective policies to control inflation need to focus on the underlying causes of inflation in the economy. If, for instance, the main cause is excess demand for goods and services, then government policy should look to reduce the level of aggregate demand. If cost push inflation is the root cause, production costs need to be controlled for the problem to be reduced.</p>
<p>In order to control demand side inflation government can use deflationary fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending, taxation and borrowing to affect the level and growth of aggregate demand, output and jobs. A deflationary fiscal policy involves a cut in government expenditure and/or an increase in direct taxes. Increasing taxes will result in lower disposable income for households leading to a fall in consumption. Moreover, increased taxes will result in lower profits for firms and thus they revise their investment plans downward. These fiscal measures will increase the rate of leakages from the circular flow and reduce injections into the circular flow, consequently reducing AD and hence inflation. However these results are achieved at the cost of slower growth rate and unemployment. Also, it could take a long time for economy to respond to these measures - the response lags may run into years not months. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these measures largely depends on the availability of accurate key data. Usually the key data on the economy is often delayed and is subject to revisions.</p>
<p>On the contrary, monetarist believe that government spending and tax changes can only have a temporary effect on AD, output and jobs and that monetary policy is a more effective instrument for controlling AD and inflationary pressure. Monetary policy influences the decisions that we make about how much we save, borrow and spend. Thus decisions made by the central banks that operate monetary policy can have a powerful effect on consumers and businesses through changes in interest rate and rate of growth of money supply. Deflationary monetary policy controls the growth of AD through an increase in interest rates and a contraction in money supply. There are several ways in which changes in interest rates influence aggregate demand, output and prices. These are collectively known as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</p>
<p>One of the channels that the monetary authorities can use to influence aggregate demand, and inflation, is via the lending and borrowing rates charged in the financial markets. When the central bank's own base interest rate goes up, then commercial banks typically increase how much they charge on loans and the interest that they offer on savings. This discourages businesses from taking out loans to finance investment and encourages the consumer to save rather than spend - and so depresses aggregate demand.</p>
<p>However time lags should always be considered when analyzing the effects of interest rate changes. Also monetary policy is not an exact science - what happens in the macro economy is the result of millions of decisions taken by households and businesses. We cannot predict with great accuracy the extent to which a change in interest rates will achieve the desired/planned economic effects. When it comes to inflation targeting there are many factors affecting costs and prices and most of these are outside of the central bank's direct control e.g. changes in international commodity prices and fluctuations in the exchange rate.</p>
<p>On the supply side a rise in the value of the exchange rate might be achieved by an increase in interest rates or through the purchase of sterling via central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets. A stronger currency reduces import prices. And this makes firms' raw materials and components cheaper; therefore helping them control costs and hence inflation. It also provides domestic firms an incentive to keep costs down to remain competitive in the world market. However an appreciation in the currency makes country's exports more expensive and could reduce the volume of exports leading to a strain on trade balance.</p>
<p>Alternatively if a greater output can be produced at a lower cost per unit, then the economy can achieve sustained economic growth without inflation. An increase in aggregate supply is often a key long term objective of government economic policy. In the diagram below we see the benefits of an outward shift in the long run aggregate supply curve. The equilibrium level of real national income increases and the average price level remains relatively constant.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a4ee3ba0874864c750a049d43388e0c6" alt="" width="372" height="282"></p>
<p>Supply side reforms seek to increase the productive capacity of the economy in the long run and raise the trend rate of growth of labour and capital productivity. Productivity gains help to control unit labour costs and put less pressure on producers to raise their prices.</p>
<p>From the above discussion it follows that the key to controlling inflation in the long run is for the authorities to keep control of aggregate demand through fiscal and monetary policy and at the same time seek to achieve improvements to the supply side of the economy. The credibility of inflation control policies can often be enhanced by the introduction of inflation targets.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 38</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9494</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The combination of rapid economic growth and inflation is no coincidence.</p>

While the percentage annual increase in a country's real GDP is called short term actual growth. Both concepts can be illustrated on a graph showing PPC.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/62a8844a86841138f37e09136729a9f1" alt="" width="293" height="228"></p>
<p>A PPC reflects the potential output, therefore, potential growth is indicated by an outward shift from PPC<sub>1</sub> to PPC<sub>2</sub>. This can be achieved by increased supply and improvement in productivity of factor inputs, increase in capital stock, improvement in technology and exploitation of new finds of natural resources.<br>Actual growth, however, is indicated by a movement from inside towards PPC as indicated by movementf rom point a to b.</p>
<p>Short term rapid growth in GDP results from the a persistent outward shift in aggregate demand (AD). AD shows various amounts of goods and services (real output) that domestic consumers, businesses, government, and foreign buyers collectively desire to purchase at each possible price level.</p>
<p>Thus AD = C + I + G + X - M</p>
<p>So an increase in AD is the result of higher consumer spending (C), increased capital spending (I), a rise in government expenditure on goods and services (G) and an increase in net exports (X-M). So when AD rises it uses up the existing capacity hence results in an increase in real output (GDP). Consider the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a44a999979cfb25e71ccd078e0f49a22" alt="" width="364" height="229"></p>
<p>AD curve slopes downward from left to right simply illustrates the inverse relationship between price level and the real GDP the buyers will purchase. On the other hand an aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the level of real domestic output which will be produced at each price level. Upward sloping AS suggests that higher price levels create an incentive for enterprises to produce and sell more, while lower price levels reduce output. As a result, the relationship between the price level and the amount of real output businesses offer for sale is direct or positive. Equilibrium output is determined by the intersection of AD ＆ AS.<br>At output Y<sub>1</sub> the economy is in a severe recession and that large amount of unused machinery and equipment and unemployed workers are available for production. These idle resources-both human and property-can be put back at work with little or no upward pressure on the prices. Thus an increase in AD results in an increase in real GDP from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub> accompanied with some increase in general price level. As the AD rises further to AD<sub>3</sub> economy expands in real-output from Y<sub>2</sub> to Y<sub>3</sub>, some industries may encounter shortages of workers while other industries face substantial unemployment. At the same time in certain industries rawmaterial shortages or other production bottlenecks may begin to appear. Expansion may also mean some firms will be forced to use older and less efficient machinery as they approach capacity production. Also, less capable workers may be hired as output expands. All these things tend to decrease productivity, increase costs, and raise prices from P<sub>2</sub> to P<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>On the extreme, we find that the economy reaches its full-capacity real output Y<sub>f</sub>· Any increase in the AD and hence the price level in this range will not produce additional real output because the economy is already operating at its full capacity. Resources and additional production, which one firm gains will be lost by some other firm. This bidding will raise resource prices (costs) and ultimately product prices, but real output will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Thus it follows that sustained growth caused by rising aggregate demand can lead to acceleration in inflation as the economy uses up scarce resources and short run aggregate supply becomes inelastic. When SRAS is elastic, an outward shift of aggregate demand can easily be met by a rise in real GDP (there is plenty of spare capacity and supply responds elastically to the higher level of AD). But when SRAS becomes inelastic, the trade-off between growth and inflation worsens - an increase in AD tends to lead to higher prices rather than increased output and employment. However potential growth in the long run leading to an increase in AS can offset the rising pressure on price level.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 39</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9483</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In 2011, as a result of a recession, the governments of some countries reduced the wages that they paid to public sector workers. Trade unions organised mass demonstrations in protest.</p>
<p>Discuss how the economic theory of wage determination in perfect competition can be adapted to explain such a situation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply of labour. In such a market many firms compete with one another in hiring a specific type of labour. Moreover, there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The market demand for labor curve is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves (MRP<sub>L&nbsp;</sub>curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is the increase in revenue that results from employing one more worker. MRP<sub>L</sub> is obtained by multiplying marginal physical product of labour (MPP<sub>L</sub>) and the firm's marginal revenue (MR). Thus MRP<sub>L</sub>= MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR. MPP<sub>L</sub> is the increase in total output when one more worker is employed and is subject to the law of diminishing returns while MR is determined by the price of the finished product.</p>
<p>On the supply side of labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labour slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/cdf66117d3d08e706c782498fed3b705" alt="" width="482" height="197"></p>
<p>The graph sums up wage determination and equilibrium for a profit maximising firm facing a perfectly competitive labour market. The left panel shows that the wage rate is determined in the market by demand and supply forces and the firm is a wage taker. On the right panel the downward sloping portion of the firm's MRP<sub>L&nbsp;</sub>curve is its demand for labour. The firm faces a perfectly elastic supply curve of labour that also represents firm's MC<sub>L</sub>＆ AC<sub>L</sub>. It implies that additional labour can be hired at the same wage rate, therefore W = MC<sub>L</sub>= AC<sub>L</sub>. So, according to the MRP theory the firm will find it profitable to hire ON workers where its MRP<sub>L</sub> equals MC<sub>L</sub>. The firm would not employ more than On workers because each additional worker would add less to the revenue than its costs thus leading to a fall in its profit. Similarly, On<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">1</span>&nbsp;workers employed indicates that the firm can increase its profit by employing more because each additional worker hired up to On would add more to the firm's revenue than its costs.</p>
<p>Although economic theory of wage determination assumes a perfectly competitive market, however, the theory could be extended to allow various real world market imperfections. There may be, for instance, a single buyer of labour - a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory is the main source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, then the wage rate, (AC<sub>L</sub>) is no longer represented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the wage rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence, monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market supply curve and in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the size of an employer's demand for labour will affect the wage rate. This is illustrated in the figure below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c2c5504f58b43e8567537bfa45db363a" alt="" width="360" height="229"></p>
<p>The higher MC<sub>L</sub> than AC<sub>L</sub> can be explained by the use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £100, 50 workers may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to employ one more worker he is forced to offer £101, the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now £ 101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid to the 51 st worker plus £1 paid to each of the 50 original workers.</p>
<p>Similar to the perfect market a monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ where its MC<sub>L</sub> equals MRP<sub>L</sub>, indicated by point A in the graph, hence L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate W1, however, is given by the S curve (AC<sub>L</sub>). In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony market the wage and numbers being employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. Thus monopsony power in a labour market will result in a lower level of employment and lower wages than would exist in a competitive labour market. However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment can be corrected by incorporating trade unions or government.</p>
<p>In the context of question statement if government enjoys monopsony power then trade unions could seek to resist the wage decrease of their members by either restricting the supply of labour or by direct negotiation. They can restrict the supply of labour through the use of a closed shop or by lengthening the time it takes to complete an apprenticeship. Over a period of time this could reduce the supply of labour to an industry, shifting the supply curve from SL<sub>1</sub> to SL<sub>2</sub> shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/bd5fc5893ca091c13629e009abe44ef1" alt="" width="312" height="233"></p>
<p>The result would be an increase in the wage rate from W<sub>1</sub> to W <sub>2</sub>, but with a reduced number employed, i.e. L<sub>2</sub> instead of L<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br>Alternatively, trade unions can influence the market through collective bargaining. It involves the direct negotiation between a trade union, bargaining collectively on behalf of its members, and the employer(s). If they are operating in a perfectly competitive labour market a successful collective bargaining could raise the wage rate from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>, as illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1514c0a9edaaa3473222184c4b5bdc18" alt="" width="360" height="297"></p>
<p>The trade union may be unwilling to supply labour below the wage rate of W<sub>2</sub>; therefore, the supply curve becomes W<sub>2</sub>AS<sub>L</sub>, being perfectly elastic over the section W<sub>2</sub>A. At the equilibrium wage of W<sub>1</sub>, with no trade union involvement, L<sub>1</sub> workers would be employed. However, with a wage of W<sub>2</sub>, only L<sub>2</sub> are demanded and therefore L<sub>3</sub> - L<sub>2</sub> are unable to find employment. There may be individuals who are willing to work for a wage below W<sub>2</sub> but they would be prevented from doing so by the union agreement. So through collective bargaining a wage rate of W<sub>2</sub> has been agreed, with L<sub>2</sub> being employed. The same result is obtained when government fixes the minimum wage at W<sub>2</sub>. The union, however, could attempt to maintain employment at the equilibrium level of L<sub>1</sub> while obtaining a wage W<sub>2</sub>. This would involve forcing the employer off the demand curve, thus obtaining position B. This will only be successful if the government is able to sustain employment at L<sub>1</sub> while paying a wage rate of W<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other case suppose that the workers in this industry organize themselves under a single union so that the government being a monopsonistic employer now faces a monopoly union-a bilateral monopoly. In this case the two sides will settle the wage through collective bargaining. The outcome of bargaining depends on the objective and strength of each side as shown in the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e978ef389c8d8dfa22fd389876641c72" alt="" width="336" height="237"></p>
<p>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. The successful resistance from the trade union sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, which will kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal cost curve of labour.</p>
<p>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub> workers.</p>
<p>Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually employs more workers. It is only when the union forces the wage rate above W<sub>3</sub> that employment starts to fall. This figure can also be used to illustrate the effect of the government imposing a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub> on a monopsonistic labour market where the equilibrium wage was initially W<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus the theory of wage determination can be modified to analyse various labour market imperfections such as the government setting up the wage level or trade unions influencing the market through various measures.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 40</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9472</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss how a government might achieve a more equal distribution of income.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>For any government whether the current distribution of income is desirable or not is a normative issue. However, if the government in the office feels that some members of society have more money than they need, whereas other struggle to afford even basic necessities then there is an unfair income inequality.</p>
<p>Government can adopt various measures, ranging from taxation to regulation and welfare benefits, in order to redistribute income from rich to poor.<br>It is mainly through taxes a government collects money that it needs to pay for its expenditures. Taxes can be divided into those paid directly to the authorities (direct taxes) e.g. personal income tax, tax on capital and wealth and those paid via a middle person (indirect taxes). Indirect taxes include GST (general sales tax), excise and custom duties. A tax that raises the money by taking a larger percentage of income from the rich than the poor is called a progressive tax.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if a larger percentage of income is taken from the poor than the rich, it is called a regressive tax and the same percentage of income paid in tax is called proportional. Thus progressivet axes have the effect of reducing inequality while regressive taxes increase it.</p>
<p>A government with the aim of reducing income inequality can tax the rich proportionately more than the poor in order to create vertical equity. At the same time it can enhance the personal tax allowances to ensure horizontal equity. Horizontal equity entails that the size of the allowance must vary according to the person's circumstances. Individuals with more dependents, for instance, should be entitled with higher tax allowance than the individuals with less number of dependents. Vertical equity, on the other hand, means that the burden of tax on different individuals with different income should be fair. So, the redistribution effect depends on the degree of progressiveness of the tax. The more steeply progressive they are, the bigger is the reduction in inequality.</p>
<p>On the other hand, taxes on goods and services are generally regressive; therefore, the government must reduce their rates. It will benefit the poor proportionately more than the rich. In order to make them more effective the government must cut the rate mostly on those goods consumed relatively by poor people.</p>
<p>However using taxes to redistribute income has various limitations. First, any rigorous redistribution from rich to poor may seriously reduce growth and efficiency by undermining work incentives. Second, high taxes on the rich may encourage tax evasion or avoidance. Thus using&nbsp;taxes to reduce inequality involves costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the expenditure side government can use a range of welfare benefits. These benefits can be in cash or in kind. Cash benefits can be further classified into meanstested or universal. Benefits such as income support, particularly transferring income from rich to poor are referred to as income targeted or means-tested benefits while universal benefits such as state pension are provided to everyone, irrespective of their incomes.</p>
<p>Alternatively benefits that individual receive not as direct cash payments but in the form of goods and services provided free or at subsidized rates. The two examples in most countries are education and health care.</p>
<p>Means-tested benefits are more efficient in terms of reducing income inequality. However the government needs to make the procedure simple to make it fully effective. Thus the government must combine progressive taxation with maximum of means-tested benefits in order to reduce income inequality. <br>Other policies of government may focus on increasing the earnings of those with lower incomes. One way of tackling low incomes is to enforce minimum wage rates on employers. This is seen as an indirect way of increasing incomes of low earners. However, the theory predicts that the policy might lead to an increase in unemployment as firms may choose to hire fewer workers. Similarly government may enact equal pay legislation particularly designed to raise the wages of workers who are discriminated against. Again economic theory suggests that this will have the effect as the imposition of a minimum wage. Thus there is a direct trade-off between higher pay and fewer jobs.</p>
<p>Alternatively government may focus on policies particularly designed to reduce unemployment. In the long term, effective policies to reduce the total level of unemploymentc ould help reduce income inequalities. These policies include providing training in order to improve the employability of labour - so that the unemployed have the right skills to take up the available job opportunities.</p>
<p>Thus it follows that government needs to formulate an integrated program comprising of tax, benefits and other market oriented policies in order to reduce income inequality.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 41</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9469</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how a consumer allocates expenditure according to the principle of equimarginal utility and analyse how a change in income might affect that allocation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Utility is the satisfaction that people derive from the consumption of goods and services. Total utility (TU) and Marginal utility (MU) are two important measures of utility. TU is the total satisfaction a consumer obtains from the consumption of all the units of a good consumed, while MU is the satisfaction gained from consuming one extra unit of a good within a given time period.</p>
<p>According to the principle of diminishing marginal utility, as more units of a good are consumed successively, an extra unit will provide less additional satisfaction than previous unit. For example, the second cup of tea in the morning gives us less additional satisfaction than the first cup. The third cup gives even less satisfaction. The relationship between TU and MU is shown below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c068ea0610116b47cadc5f4c6750c1be" alt="" width="305" height="192"><br><br>The MU curve slopes downward, simply illustrating the principle of diminishing marginal utility. The TU curve starts at the origin. Marginal utility can be derived from the TU curve. It is the slope of the line joining two adjacent quantities on the curve. The slope of such a line is given by the formula:</p>
<p>MU = ΔTU/Δ units</p>
<p>We can extend our analysis of utility to explain how a rational consumer decides what combination of goods to buy from the given income. The underlying principle is called equimarginal utility. The law states that the individual consumer is in equilibrium when it is not possible to switch his expenditure from one product to another and obtain an increase in total utility. This occurs when:</p>
<p>MU<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b&nbsp;</sub>= ...... = MU<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>Where a, b, ..... n are the various goods consumed.</p>
<p>The above equation states that the consumer equilibrium is where the utility from the last money unit spent on product a equals the utility from the last money unit spent on product b equals the utility from the last money unit spent on all other products, thus taking into account all of the products the individual consumes. When this situation is reached it is not possible for the individual to increase his total utility by reallocating expenditure. So the consumer equilibrium is important for it is where the consumer has allocated his or her income in such a way that maximum utility has been achieved. The analysis assumes the following:</p>
<p>Satisfaction can be measured in utils. A util is an imaginary unit of satisfaction from the consumption of a good. Consumer is rational, and therefore wants to maximize satisfaction also his taste and preferences are constant. Consumer has a fixed income, and he will be spending on two normal goods a and b. Product a costing £2.00 each and product b costing £4.00 each, and that the individual has an income per time period of £16.00. The table below will help to explain consumer equilibrium.</p>

<p>Given this situation, it can be seen that the consumer is in equilibrium when he consumes four units of product a and two of product b. Here MU/P is the same, i.e. 8 for both products. Note that in equilibrium the consumer spends £8 (£2 x 4) on product a and £8 (£4 x 2) on product b and obtains total utility of 268 utils. It is impossible for the consumer with an income of £ 16.00 to obtain a higher level of total utility.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use marginal utility as a means of deriving a demand curve. If, for instance, price of product b were to fall to £2.00, then assuming everything else remained constant, there would be a new column for MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b</sub> and a new equilibrium would result. In order to restore equilibrium the consumer would reduce consumption of product a by 1 unit and increase the consumption of product b by 3 units. Hence, he will consume 3 units of a and 5 units of b at the new equilibrium position. We can use this example to construct the consumer's demand curve for product b as given below; <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6d0519e05ec4ea2f6c59d17597fa5a9f" alt="" width="231" height="173"><br><br>A decrease in P<sub>b</sub> has resulted anb increase in QD<sub>b</sub> because with the given income and new price of product b consumers maximizes satisfaction at a higher quantity of product b. Thus it is possible to develop a theoretical link between utility, price and the demand for a product.</p>
<p>A decrease in P<sub>b</sub> has resulted an increase in QD<sub>b</sub> because with the given income and new price of product b consumers maximizes satisfaction at a higher quantity of product b. Thus it is possible to develop a theoretical link between utility, price and the demand for a product.</p>
<p>So far we have analyzed that a change in price of a good brings a movement along the demand curve assuming money income remains unchanged. Thus each demand curve is drawn for a particular level of income therefore a change in income must lead to a shift in the demand curve itself.</p>
<p>When, for instance, income rises and the demand curve shifts to the right, the good is described as normal. In this case the good is said to have a positive income effect i.e. consumer wants to buy more of this good as his income increases. In other case if demand falls i.e. it shifts to the left when income rises we then describe the good as inferior and the good is associated with negative income effect. This simply means that consumption of the good falls as income rises.</p>
<p>The graphs below show the effect of a rise in income on the demand for a normal ＆ inferior good. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/bd10614e2ac08c36bb51f0c942aac4e9" alt="" width="450" height="226"></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In 2011, two soap and detergent firms, Unilever and Procter ＆ Gamble, were fined a total of €315 m (US$ 220 m) for fixing the price of washing powder in eight European countries. Procter ＆ Gamble is the world's largest consumer products company. The two firms had colluded over prices for more than three years. The collusion began when they agreed to implement an industry-wide programme to improve the environmental impact of their products. They agreed to reduce the amount of packaging they used but to keep the prices unchanged. Then, later, they collectively agreed to raise prices in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. This collusion was against the European Union competition laws and was regarded as 'unfair competition'.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Analyse, using Table 1, whether price fixing benefited Procter and Gamble.</li>
<li>Suggest why creating the advantage of large scale by 'integrating across its different businesses' might benefit a firm.</li>
<li>Is the evidence in the article sufficient to conclude that Procter and Gamble is working against the public interest?</li>

<li>Collusion is an agreement among the firms in an industry to limit competition among themselves with the objective of maximizing joint profit. Firms may agree to set output quotas, fix prices, limit product promotion or development or not to poach each other's markets. Collusion is more likely to occur when there are only few firms with similar cost structure producing similar product. These conditions make it easier to reach an agreement and then monitor output and price of the industry.</li>
<li>Profits rose between 2006 and 2009, but they fell in 2010 compared with 2009. Similarly, the revenue earned by the firm, though fell in 2009, but shows an overall upward trend. These changes may be attributed to price fixing or else to changes in the firm's costs structure. However, the shareholders seem to have benefited throughout the period as their dividend increased. Again this cannot be attributed to price fixing alone as it could also result from the management decision of reducing their retained earnings. Thus it cannot be stated with utmost certainty that P＆G has benefited from price fixing.</li>
<li>Integrating across its different businesses a firm might benefit from expanding individual operations involved in production of different product lines. Expanded scale of production could enable the firm to reduce per unit costs by increasing the degree of specialization and division of labour. Specialist managers can be employed in order to improve decision making while increasing division of labour could improve efficiency and proficiency of individual workers leading to a decrease in unit labour costs. In addition to this, firm can link certain production processes which can reduce costs per unit. <br><br>Not only this when buying raw materials the firm is likely to place large orders and therefore, could benefit from lower prices and special privileges from the suppliers. The firm, for instance, could ensure that it gets the raw materials in right quantity at the right time and place and of right quality. On the selling side packaging and distribution costs are likely to be lower per unit of output, as will transport and administration costs. For example, the packaging costs per item for 1 million units is likely to be substantially lower than if 1000 units were packaged. Thus the firm is likely to benefit from integrating its selling process. <br><br>In the broader context integration will help the firm to rationalize its business operation, which means concentrating on the profit making aspects of the industry and eliminating the loss making aspects.</li>
<li>Growing profits between 2006 and 2009 may be viewed as P＆G using its market power to charge unfairly high prices and hence working against public interest. Though profits were down in 2010 that may indicate a benefit for public but it can be said that profits may have been down more if there had been no collusion.<br><br>On the other hand P＆G serves public interest when it invests in research that is more than any other firm in the world. Consequently it produces a substantial number of research studies and occupies the top place in stated innovations. However, whether public benefits from their research and innovation is subject to debate. Also, P＆G, along with other competitors, agreed to reduce packaging material to avoid waste and hence to contribute in protecting environment. This can be viewed as serving the interest of general public. Moreover, a firm of their magnitude has an important contribution in terms of generating employment for hundreds and thousands. Also, their well recognized brands give the public confidence and a choice to buy what they think is the best value for their money.<br><br>In the end it is fair to conclude that additional information on changes in costs and other market conditions such as prices charged by other rival firms and their revenue and profits is required to confirm if P＆G was acting against public interest.</li>

When economists use the term efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. In other words allocative efficiency occurs when the consumer valuation equals the cost of the resources (marginal cost) used up in production of a product. Thus the condition required for allocative efficiency is price = marginal cost. When this happens economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative efficiency. <br><br></p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/7c07d4408cbaef2130b51587135446f4" alt="" width="305" height="224"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS, producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium in the market implies P = MC, hence, generating maximum possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus. Situations where either P &gt; MC or P &lt; MC imply inefficient allocation of resources as shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/072570052577e237a2cacf7b85045276" alt="" width="317" height="214"></p>
<p>At an output level of 100,000 units, P &gt; MC. It indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC. Thus each additional unit up to 200,000 would increase both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A, hence would improve allocative efficiency . On the other hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have been allocated for the production of this product. In the graph above the production of 300,000 units would represent an over allocation of resources. Hence the shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of consumer and producer surplus from the alternative product. Therefore net gains can be realized until production can be reduced to 200,000 units.</p>
<p>Hence resources are being efficiently allocated to any product when its output is such that its price equals marginal cost.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize the wastage of resources i.e when they produce a product using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/36259f952ff3aa41936dacfba51b1dcc" alt="" width="302" height="210"></p>
<p>AC<sub>3</sub> in the figure indicates productive efficiency. This means that the lowest possible cost techniques of production are being used to produce different level of output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per unit cost hence represent productive inefficiency. The firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when production occurs at the lowest point indicated by point z on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the term technical efficiency for this point. <br>Private sector, without government intervention, operates through market forces of demand and supply. Consumers indicate their willingness and ability to buy particular products through demand and firms, responding to their wishes, produce and supply those goods. Thus the decisions about what to produce are made by the people who will actually consume the goods, therefore, community's productive resources are allocated accordingly. Also firms keep production costs as low as possible to obtain highest profit margin. So, private sector is said to be both allocatively and productively efficient to a large extent.</p>
<p>Though market forces do all the good things yet there are many situations in which these forces do not produce the best outcomes. In these cases we say that markets have failed to operate efficiently.</p>
<p>Market failure exists when the competitive outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. The result is a loss of economic and social welfare. This is usually because the benefits that the free-market confers on individuals or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits to the society as a whole.</p>
<p>The first of these situations occurs when firms facing downward sloping demand curves-whether a monopoly or firms in an imperfect market - will maximize profits at an output where price exceeds marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. This is shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/adbb6048dd32e7cd8b362ce8d3704d64" alt="" width="341" height="256"></p>
<p>Under perfect competition the price is determined by market demand and supply forces, hence Pp is the market price and the industry will sell Qp output. The industry is said to achieve allocative efficiency because P = MC. On the other hand a monopolist, for instance, will produce where MC = MR. Thus it produces QM output and will sell this at Pm price. Clearly the monopolist produces where MC &lt; P, hence monopoly results in a loss of consumer and producer surplus shown by the triangular area 3 + 5. Also lack of competition reduces welfare of consumers because they have a little choice available. So, overall society will be worse off.</p>
<p>Besides imperfect markets, the existence of externalities also causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer benefits on others who are not directly involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem created by externalities is that market forces will lead to either too little or too much production. With a positive externality, a competitive free market will produce too little of the good and with a negative externality it produces too much of the good. Thus the presence of externalities, even when all markets are perfectly competitive, leads to allocatively inefficient outcomes.</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto the other party. The other party loses because they do not have the same information. More generally, whenever either party to a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency. <br>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how good or bad a particular product is for them: either they do not have the right information or they simply lack some relevant information. The problem is that their existence will cause market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of the product being produced or consumed.</p>
<p>A distinct type of market failure exists in case of public goods. The issue here is not over and under allocation but weather resources are allocated at all. A good must possess three distinguishing characteristics to qualify as public goods. It must be non-excludible, non-rival and non-rejectable. These features give rise to the free rider problem; people receiving benefits from a good without contributing to its cost. Thus it develops a situation in which everyone believes that others will take on the burden of paying for goods such as national defense and streetlights. People may wish for the provision of such goods, but the demand may never be registered in the market. Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive to supply them. Because these goods cannot be priced and sold, it would be unprofitable for a private enterprise to allocate resources to them. So we have these goods which yield substantial benefits but to which the market would fail to allocate resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion it can be stated that private sector on its own cannot achieve economic efficiency in all different areas of an economy and therefore, market failures, in particular, provide a justified economic role for government. However, government intervention in excess of market failures could hamper the efficient role of markets and might create further inefficiencies.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 44</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9446</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>It is sometimes stated that the economic growth rates of developed countries are higher than those of developing countries.</p>

While short term growth can be achieved by continuously increasing the level of aggregate demand (AD). AD is the sum of aggregate expenditure in an economy against various price levels i.e. AD = C + I + G + (X - M). Thus an increase in AD may result from a rise in either of its four components or all of them.</p>
<p>Government may focus on the demand side policies to achieve short term growth. In other words it may attempt to create sufficient AD to ensure that firms continue increasing their investments and that potential output is realized. This could be achieved by the use of reflationary fiscal or monetary policy or both. <br>Reflationary fiscal policy involves increasing the level of government expenditure or lowering the tax rates. This will raise people's disposable income and therefore encourage them to spend more. Also lower tax rates will encourage firms to increase investment. Either way the level of AD demand should rise or help encourage economic growth, while reflationary monetary policy involves reducing interest rates and increasing money supply. These measures are expected to reflate the economy. This is because the lower interest rate will increase the demand for loans for consumption and investment leading to a rise in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>However the effectiveness of these policies depends on a number of factors. For example, the more reliable are the forecasts of what is likely to happen to aggregate demand, the more able will the government be to achieve growth. On the contrary, if changes in G or T are partly offset by changes in other injections and withdrawals fiscal policy may not succeed in increasing AD. Also the extent to which changes in aggregate demand will have the desired effects on output, employment, inflation and the balance of payments may not be precisely calculated. Monetary policy is especially weak when it is pulling against the expectations of firms and consumers. The main problem arises when demand side policies result in growing shortages leading to higher (demand-pull) inflation and current account deficits.</p>
<p>For sustained and long term growth government may follow supply side policies. Supply-side economic policies are mainly micro-economic policies designed to improve the supply-side potential of an economy, make markets and industries operate more efficiently and thereby contribute to a faster rate of growth.&nbsp;<br>There are two broad approaches to the supply-side. Firstly policies focused on product markets where goods and services are produced and sold to consumers and secondly the labour market. Supply-side policies in product markets are designed to increase competition and efficiency. These policies include reforms such as privatization and deregulation and toughening up the environment for competition. They also include promotion of free international trade and creating incentives for enterprises of all sizes by providing a tax relief on research and development and reductions in the rate of corporation tax. The resulting capital spending by firms adds to aggregate demand (C + I + G + X - M) but also has an important effect on long run aggregate supply. Furthermore new businesses entering the marketplace increase competitive pressures facilitating the introduction of new ideas and technologies.</p>
<p>Labour market reforms are designed to improve the quality and quantity of the supply of labour available to the economy. They seek to make the labour market more flexible so that it is better able to match the labour force to the demands placed upon it by employers in expanding sectors thereby reducing the risk of structural unemployment.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that the supply-side does not operate in isolation from changes in aggregate demand. If there is insufficient AD, it is unlikely that better supply-side performance can be achieved over a number of years. Equally, if aggregate demand grows too quickly, acceleration in wage and price inflation might require deflationary policies that ultimately harm a country's productive potential.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 45</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9441</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>It is sometimes stated that the economic growth rates of developed countries are higher than those of developing countries.</p>

While economic growth entails an increase in the size of real GDP in an economy in the short run, it also&nbsp;shows the growth of productive potential in the long run.</p>
<p>In developing nations general levels of living, as compared to developed countries, tend to be very low for the vast majority of people. These low levels of living are manifested quantitatively and qualitatively in the form of low incomes (poverty), inadequate housing, poor health, limited education, high infant mortality, low life and work expectancies. For these countries economic growth, therefore, is a necessity if they are to remove poverty and low levels of living in general. Provided economic growth outstrips population growth, it will lead to higher real income per head. This can lead to higher levels of consumption of goods and services. Since economic welfare is related to the level of consumption, therefore growth provides an obvious gain to the societies of these countries. This is particularly true for countries who regard growth as a key route for poverty reduction among their population. According to a report published in August 2004 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), rapid growth in many of the developing countries in the Asian region has reduced the number of people living on less than $1 a day fell to 22% of the region's population in 2002.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, the rising AD and output encourages investment in capital machinery in developing countries - this helps to increase employment and sustain growth by increasing LRAS. Moreover, economic growth has a positive impact on company profits ＆ business confidence - good news for the stock market and for the growth of small and large businesses.</p>
<p>Governments in developing countries usually find it difficult to take up the public welfare projects due to the lack of finances resulting from lower tax revenue. Economic growth boosts the tax revenues flowing into the treasury because as people's incomes rise, they automatically pay more taxes. These extra revenues for the government can be spent on programmes to alleviate poverty. This will boost further economic activities leading to more employment higher incomes and more equitable distribution of income and wealth. Without a continuing rise in real GDP the scope for helping the poor is much more limited.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as people grow richer they may become less preoccupied with their own private consumption and more concerned to live in a clean environment. Thus they are more likely to contribute their share to protect the common-property environment.</p>
<p>More often developing economies suffer from a macroeconomic imbalance where they find it difficult to maintain low rate of inflation and achieve a favourable trade balance. Increasing supplies of goods and services resulting from economic growth is likely to ease the demand pressure on domestic price level hence it helps the government to check the rate of inflation. Also, an increasing domestic output reduces the level of imports and creates larger quantities of other goods and services to export thus results in an improvement in trade balance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, governments in developing economies view economic growth as an important avenue through which better living standards and lower rates of poverty can be achieved. Therefore governments in these economies often place a high priority to economic growth as a policy objective because a growing economy leads to higher living standards and greater prosperity for individuals. It also helps businesses to be profitable, which generates employment and income.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 46</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9440</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>As part of the measurement of GDP governments calculate the level of investment expenditure.</p>

<li>Investment is an important component of national income. It can be undertaken either by the private or the public sectors, and can involve the purchase of new plant and machinery, the building of new houses, factories or schools and the construction of roads and reservoirs. Net additions to stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods are also classed as investment.<br><br>Profit is an important factor in private sector investment, whereas public sector investment can be a political or social decision. <br>When a private firm purchases a new machine, the expectation is that the yield from the investment will be greater than the cost of buying machine. The expected yield is difficult to calculate since it will occur over a number of years. Also, a given sum of money received next year will be worth less than the same sum received now. Therefore, it is usual to discount these yields to their present value and to express the return over the initial cost as a rate. This rate will be referred to as the marginal efficiency capital (MEC). Thus if the MEC is greater than the real rate of interest the investment should proceed. The relationship between MEC and rate of interest is illustrated in the figure below.&nbsp;<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0b60768e844fa71ff608f45a3a0efcfd" alt="" width="333" height="239"><br>By investing, a firm can build up a stock of capital goods and, as with labour, capital is subject to the law of diminishing returns so the MEC will fall. So long as the MEC is greater than the rate of interest, the investment is worthwhile. In figure above, investment should cease once k<sub>1</sub> is reached at an interest rate r<sub>1</sub>. &nbsp;A fall in the rate of interest to r<sub>2</sub> will lead to a rise in the capital stock from k<sub>1</sub> to k<sub>2</sub>. The increase in capital stock, k<sub>2</sub>-k<sub>1</sub>, will require new investment to take place. The size of the capital stock, therefore, varies with the rate of interest. <br><br>In our explanation above, the rate of interest was assumed to be the rate at which firms have to borrow money. However, a large part of investment by firms is financed from retained profit. This does not alter the relationship between the rate of interest and investment. Thus, the higher the rate of interest on savings, the higher the opportunity cost of investment and hence the lower will be the amount of planned investment in the economy. <br><br>Although rate of interest is the main factor influencing investment but several other factors can also lead to a change in investment. For instance, if business executives become more optimistic about future business, the planned investment curve will shift to the right; a pessimistic outlook will shift it to the left. Business expectations may be based on changes in the domestic political and economic climate, international relations, population growth and stock market conditions. <br><br>Furthermore, a rapid rate of technological progress stimulates investment. The development of a more efficient machine, for example, will lower production costs, increasing the expected rate of net profit from investing in new machine. Finally, business owners look to expected profits after taxes in making their investment decisions. An increase in business taxes will lower profitability and lowers the level of planned investment; a tax reduction will stimulate investment. <br><br>In the preceding analysis we assumed that investment was planned or autonomous. This is an assumption which we now relax, with investment being partly induced. This means that investment is related to national income. When for instance, consumer demand increases it can have an effect on investment. The rate of change of national income will thus bring about changes in the level of net investment through what is called the accelerator principle.&nbsp;<br>GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in one year time period. The level of GDP is determined by planned aggregate expenditure i.e.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AE = C + I + G + (X - M) <br><br>The term AE denotes the total spending on goods and services produced in an economy. It consists of four elements: <br>
<ul>
<li>Consumer spending (C)</li>
<li>Investment expenditure (I)</li>
<li>government spending (G)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Net expenditure on exports and imports (X - M).<br><br>Investment is one of the four components of planned expenditure therefore, a change in the level of investment expenditure would in turn change the planned expenditure leading to a proportionately greater change in the country's GDP through what is known the multiplier effect. <br><br>We define multiplier as the ratio of the change in GDP to the change in planned expenditure. The extent of change in GDP can be measured by the following: <br><br>K = (change in GDP)/(Change in injection ) or K = 1/(MPS + MPT + MPM)<br><br>To elaborate we assume that the economy is open with government sector and there are unemployed resources. The MPS, MPT and MPM are 0.3, 0.1 and 0.1 respectively and that the firms increase their level of planned investment by $100 million. By applying the formula we can calculate the value of K in this economy and then the resulting change in GDP. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5 = 1/(0.3 + 0.1 + 0.1)<br><br>Hence, effect on GDP is 2.5 times of change in investment i.e. $100 x 2.5 = 250. <br>The cause of multiplier effect is that, any increase in injection into the economy will produce a stream of new incomes through additional spending. For example, if firms to invest more, this will lead to more people being employed and hence more incomes being paid to households. Households will then spend part of this increased income on domestically produced goods (the remainder will be withdrawn). This increased consumption will encourage firms to produce more goods to meet the demand. Firms will thus employ more people and other factors of production. This leads to even more incomes being paid out to households. Consumption will thus increase yet again, and so the process continues. Since multiplier is not infinite, therefore, an increase in injections would not cause national income to go on rising forever. Each time people receive extra income they will save some of it, pay some of it in taxes and spend some of it on imports. Hence income generation would become progressively smaller after each transaction.&nbsp;<br>Thus a change in the level of investment is expected to result in a proportionately larger change in GDP of an economy.<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to assess how well an economy has performed in comparison to other countries or over a period of time, we must have a means of measuring the value of the nation's output. The measure that economists widely use for this purpose is called GDP. We define GDP as the monetary value of total output produced within the country over a twelve month period. <br><br>GDP is used to compare performance of an economy compared to other countries. Also GDP is used to calculate the rate of economic growth. Most common usage of GDP is to determine living standard between countries and over time. For governments GDP figures provide the basis to formulate their economic policies. <br><br>If we are to make sensible use of GDP figures, we must take inflation and size of population into account. Increasing price level, for instance, may increase the GDP figure more than the increase in output while ignoring the changes in the size of population could make an unreal comparison of living standard over a period of time or between countries. <br><br>However, even after making these adjustments economists question the reliability of GDP as an economic indicator for various reasons. <br>Firstly, national GDP figures hide significant regional variations in output, employment and incomes per head of population. Within each region there are also areas of relative prosperity contrasting with unemployment black-spots and deep-rooted social and economic deprivation. Also, GDP figures on their own do not show the distribution of income and the uneven spread of financial wealth. Incomes and earnings may be very unequally distributed among the population and rising national prosperity can still be accompanied by rising relative poverty. <br><br>Furthermore, rising national output might have been accompanied by an increase in pollution and other negative externalities which have a negative effect on economic welfare. Output figures also tell us little about the quality of goods and services produced. Also rising national output might have been achieved at the expense of leisure time if workers are working longer hours.<br><br>Moreover, we need to analyse the balance between consumption and investment. If an economy devotes too many resources to satisfying the short run needs ＆ wants of consumers, there may be insufficient resources for investment needed for long term economic development. Faster economic growth might improve living standards today but lead to an overexploitation of scarce finite economic resources thereby limiting future growth prospects. <br><br>GDP figures might understate the true living standards because of the existence and growth of black or informal economy. Black economy includes illegal and undeclared transactions while informal sector is the non-monetised part of the economy, It includes output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and selfconsumed products. The Economist's latest estimate for the total value of the black economy throughout the world is $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. According to their survey, Nigeria and Thailand have the world's largest black economies, both accounting for more than 70% of official GDP.&nbsp;<br><br>Lastly, GDP figures are calculated from millions of different returns to the government. Inevitably mistakes are made- returns are inaccurate or simply not completed. Therefore the figures are not exact and accurate and do not provide a precise and accurate account of economic activities. <br><br>Compared to GDP figures the composite measures of economic development namely Human Development Index and the Human Poverty Index may provide a better assessment. Both are simple composite measures of the extent to which living standards vary across countries. <br><br>HDI is an alternative measure of a country's economic standard of living that has been developed under the United Nations Development Programme. HDI is the average of three indicators <br>
<ul>
<li>Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)</li>
<li>Life expectancy at birth, in years</li>
<li>Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight) <br><br>The closer the HDI is to 1, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators. <br>The Human Poverty Index (HPI) measures the proportion of people not expected to meet specified target levels for given economic and quality of life indicators: <br>HPI data seeks to provide a "multidimensional measure of poverty". It focuses on four basic dimensions of human life - longevity, knowledge, economic provisioning and social inclusion. <br><br>From the discussion above it follows that GDP figure alone is insufficient and inaccurate economic indicator.</li>

This is unfair.</p>
<p>Analyse how economic theory can explain these differences in wage rates and consider whether you agree with the conclusion of this statement.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply of labour. Many firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type of labour characterize this type of market. Also, there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit.</p>
<p>Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product, MRP<sub>L</sub>, is the increase in revenue due to employing one more unit of labour. MRP<sub>L</sub> is determined by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied by the MR i.e. MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labour slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6b277bce74a85138692cac91b987781e" alt="" width="462" height="197"></p>
<p>In the figure above, both equilibrium wage rate and level of employment are determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves as depicted in the left panel of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this type of labor up to the point at which its marginal revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>)is equal to marginal cost of labour (MC<sub>L</sub>) as shown in the right panel of the graph. At a wage rate above OW the number of workers available to work is in excess than the employment opportunities. While at a wage rate below OW there exists a shortage of workers. Thus a mismatch between QD and QS in either situation forces the wage rate to equilibrium position.</p>
<p>The theory further assumes that changes in the market forces of demand and supply will eventually restore a stable equilibrium at a new wage level.</p>
<p>Demand for labour curve shifts if one of the conditions of demand changes. As mentioned above that the demand for labour curve is derived from the MRP curve, which, in turn, is calculated by MPP x MR. Therefore if there is an improvement in labour productivity then this will mean that the workers will produce more at any given wage rate , and the MPP curve will shift to the right, shifting the MRP curve to the right. Similarly, if the price of the good being produced changes, then this will change the MR and hence the MRP at all wage levels and the MRP curve will shift leading to a change in wage rate as shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/42663d77e8016743ebdba1f074eb169c" alt="" width="333" height="269"></p>
<p>We can see how shifts in demand curve will affect the equilibrium wage and labour employed. The initial equilibrium is wage W<sub>1</sub> and employment L<sub>1</sub>. If, for example, there were an improvement in the productivity levels of the workers in an industry say due to a more efficient use of labour through shift, then the labour demand curve (MRP curve) would shift to the right, causing a rise in the real wage rate to W<sub>2</sub> and a rise in numbers employed to L<sub>2</sub>. Likewise a fall in the price of the good say due to a fall in real incomes would make the value of MRP to fall for all wage levels, and so the labour demand curve would shift to the left, giving wage W<sub>3</sub> and labour employed L<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Just like the demand for labour, changes in supply of labour can also lead to a change in equilibrium wage rate and employment. An increase, for instance, in the number of people in the economy available to work in the given industry will increase supply. This could be because of an increase in net immigration or a change in the demographics of the economy. These increases in numbers will shift the supply of labour curve to the right.</p>
<p>A less obvious cause is the situation in other industries. If, in relative terms, the wage rate becomes less attractive in a similar industry, or the working conditions deteriorate, then the industry in question will experience an increase in the number of workers offering their labour services. This will shift the supply of labour curve to the right.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f9b5d91d87b047b749aaa5d493e0bab6" alt="" width="305" height="251"></p>
<p>In the diagram above, we can see what happens to the equilibrium when the supply curve shifts. A shift to the right causes the wage rate to fall (from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>) and the numbers employed to rise (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>2</sub>). &nbsp;A shift to the left causes the real wage rate to rise (from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>3</sub>) and the numbers employed to fall (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>3</sub>) .</p>
<p>Referring to the question the theory better explains the market for hospital nurses rather than the entertainment workers. In case of public sector hospital nurses, low wage rate can be explained by the monoposony model where government is the biggest, if not the sole, employer of nurses and relatively high and elastic supply of workers. The market demand for such workers would be low and relatively elastic. It is low because the society places relatively lower value on their services therefore their MRP<sub>L</sub> and wage rate is relatively is lower. It is elastic because their role in providing health care is not particularly considered essential. On the other hand supply of nurses would be large and relatively elastic. The supply would be abundant because low entry requirements short training period and low cost.</p>
<p>In addition the lower wages of public sector nurses are more likely to result from the weaker bargaining strength of trade union due to the low and elastic demand and abundant supply. Also the government might have exercised its monopsony powers to maintain the wage rate at a lower level. <br>In the case of entertainment workers the economic theory does not explain high wage rate adequately. None of the assumption of the theory fits in the entertainment industry. There is no situation of many buyers and many workers because there are few employers and few workers. The entertainment industry is an oligopoly; where a few large entertainment firms dominate the industry. There are not many professional workers available and they are not homogeneous thus making it difficult to plot a market demand and supply curve rather each worker has his own demand and supply. Workers are not mobile at least in the short run. Over all supply is relatively inelastic because it requires talent and a long training period to become an accomplished actor or a singer. Thus the workers in entertainment industry can command high wages due to a higher MRP and demand and restricted supply. Their demand is inelastic because their role cannot be substituted with other inputs and it is high because people place a high value for their services. Supply on the other hand is restricted due to the particular natural talent required and cost on training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the lower wages of nurses compared to the wages received by the workers in entertainment industry is the result of different market conditions, weaker bargaining position of trade union and the government control. Whether it is unfair is value judgment and therefore depends on who is being asked. Public sector nurses might feel that they are not being paid fare wages while workers in entertainment industry might feel it is fair for them to receive higher wages mainly due to the nature of work and the longer period of training. On the other hand government might feel that according to the economic situation and market conditions they are. paying fair wages to nurses.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 48</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9419</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Small and Medium Enterprises in Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>SMEs are recognised as an important source of economic growth and their development has been given priority by the government. 72% of government development programmes, worth US$ 178 million, were provided for SMEs in 2008. A further US$ 156 million was provided in 2009.</p>
<p>With these funds, the government has introduced several programmes for SMEs including the provision of loans, technical advice and information on prices, production and technology. Government programmes also help producers identify the products markets require and understand changes in consumer tastes. The aim of the programmes is to encourage a better performance from SMEs.</p>
<p>Initially, Malaysia protected local enterprises. However, realising the huge potential that foreign investment could bring, government policy has changed and now encourages programmes that welcome more direct foreign investment.</p>

</li>
<li>Firms performing better will have relatively growing market share or swelling profits while a decline in relative profit levels or market share suggests poor performance.</li>
<li>Technical information and finance are critical for starting, maintaining and growing small and medium businesses. Government's policies of lending much needed funds and necessary technical advice will encourage people who aspire to start new businesses. This will help them to become self employed and create jobs for others. As a consequence these policies will not only help SMEs to grow in numbers but will help them to survive and increase their share of output and employment all across the economy.<br><br>Also, the growing number of SMEs will give necessary competition to large dominating firms who then will be forced to improve their efficiency levels thus making markets to come closer to achieving productive and allocative efficiency.<br><br>In addition, SMEs usually find it hard to survive in difficult economic conditions particularly due to the lack of funds and technical expertise. These set of policies will enable SME's to explore new business avenues and introduce innovation both in products and production process. This might eventually result in wider choice, lower prices and better quality products available to consumers.</li>
<li>A far greater number of SMEs than the large enterprises and also employing over half the country's workforce make them all important to the economy. However, their contribution to the total output is disproportionate to their number and share of employment. They account for 43.5% of total output and the value of their share in total exports is only 19%. <br>The manufacturing sector is the main contributor to the total output and SME's share of output is only 34.9% while their number of enterprises is 89.3%. On the contrary, the larger enterprises account for only 10. 7% of the number of enterprises in manufacturing and their contribution to the total manufacturing output is 65.1%. <br><br>Agricultural sector is contributing the least to the total output of the economy, however, it accounts for the largest percentage of SME's by sector.<br>Similar disparity is viewed in the service sector where, SMEs account for 96.7% of the total number of enterprises but their share of output to the total output of this sector is only 56.6%. The remaining 3.3% of larger enterprises produce 43.4% of the output. <br><br>A disproportionate percentage of numbers of SME's and their percentage share of output to each sector of the economy and then to the total output and value of exports suggest a different perspective on their importance. However, their number and share of employment, in particular, make them a significant feature of the economy.</li>

It is therefore measured by the rate of change in real GDP. Economic growth is a necessity if the developing countries want to remove mass poverty, provide decent housing, adequate health care and education facilities.</p>
<p>High rate of economic growth is viewed as a positive indicator for number reasons. Provided economic growth outstrips population growth, it will lead to higher real income per head. This can result in higher level of consumption of goods and services subsequently leading to an increase in employment. Thus growth is an important avenue through which better living standards and lower rates of poverty can be achieved. This is particularly true for countries who regard growth as a key route for poverty reduction among their population. According to a report published in August 2004 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), rapid growth in many of the countries in the Asian region has reduced the number of people living on less than $1 a day fell to 22% of the region's population in 2002. That compares with 34% in 1990 and shows "considerable progress in the fight against poverty."</p>
<p>Moreover, growth has a positive impact on profits ＆ business confidence - good news for the stock market and for the growth of small and large businesses. All of these coupled with the rising AD and output encourage investment in capital machinery - this helps to sustain growth by increasing LRAS.</p>
<p>The government receives higher tax revenues known as "fiscal dividend". Government finances are cyclical in nature because a growing economy boosts the tax revenues flowing into the Treasury and it also provides the government with more money to finance spending projects. Also this allows the government to redistribute incomes from the rich to the poor by spending money on programmes to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p>In addition, countries with economic growih have more resources available to invest in cleaner technologies. And, as nations move to later stages of development, energy intensity levels start to fall. Much depends on how many resources an economy is willing to devote to environmental improvement and protection. Over the last thirty years, the ratio of energy consumption per unit of GDP has fallen quite significantly. The reduction in energy intensity is a reflection of improvements in production technologies and also a gradual switch towards a low carbon economy.</p>
<p>Overall economic growth has made it possible to expect to live on average 30 years longer, to work almost half the amount of time we used to every year and to enjoy an array of new goods and services, including air travel, antibiotics, computers and televisions.</p>
<p>Although our material progress can be measured in part by the growth of national output, income and spending, but it is important to recognize that economic growth does not come risk-free.</p>
<p>There is the danger of demand-pull and cost-push inflation if demand grows faster than long run productive potential High and rising inflation can be destabilizing for an economy because it puts pressure on interest rates to rise and can cause a loss of competitiveness for domestic businesses in international markets.</p>
<p>The current opportunity cost of growth is the present consumption. The finances can come from higher savings or higher taxes. Either way, there must be a cut in present consumption. In the short run at least, higher growth leads to less consumption.</p>
<p>Economic growth cannot be separated from its environmental impact. Fast growth of production and consumption can create negative externalities such as increased noise and air pollution and road congestion. Environmental damage can have a negative effect on our quality of life and limits our sustainable rate of growth. For example, road transport is responsible for 25% of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions once emissions from fuel processing and vehicle manufacturing arc taken into account.</p>
<p>Not all of the benefits of growth are evenly distributed. We can sec a rise in real GDP but also growing income and wealth inequality in society which is reflected in an increase in relative poverty. The Gini coefficient is one way to measure the inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth in different countries. The higher the value for the Gini co-efficient (the maximum value is 1), then greater the inequality. In countries such as Japan, many people believe that excessive persuit of material growth by the government can lead to a more greedy, more selfish and less caring society. As society becomes industrialized, violence, crime, stress related illnesses, suicides, divorce and other social problems are likely to rise. Although average living standards may be rising, the gap between rich and poor can widen, leading to an increase in relative poverty and a widening of the gap between different regions.</p>
<p>According to the economic theory, a growing economy leads to higher living standards and greater prosperity for individuals. It also helps businesses to be profitable, which generates employment and income. However, it&nbsp; also imposes costs on society, therefore, nations need to view the problem as one of constrained optimization i.e. they should seek policies that will maximize growth, while keeping within its constraints.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 50</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9414</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>As an economy develops the relative importance of different sectors of production changes.

Primary sector includes the extraction of natural resources such as coal mining, iron ore mining, agriculture and fishing. Secondary sector involves manufacturing of finished goods such as textile, steel, cars etc. Tertiary sector provides services which enable the production of goods by primary and secondary producers to take place more efficiently. It consists of two parts, commercial services and direct personal services. Commercial services include banking, insurance advertising etc. while direct personal services&nbsp;refer to the services such as doctors teachers lawyers etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the initial stage of development most developing economies are oriented toward the production primary products (agriculture, fuel. forestry, and raw materials) as opposed to secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (service) activities. These primary commodities contribute more to their GDP than the other sectors. This is because the vast majority of people in developing countries lives and works in rural areas. Therefore a larger proportion of their workforce is engaged in primary sector and only a small portion is employed in secondary and tertiary sector.</p>
<p>As the country develops modernization of agriculture releases labour for the secondary and tertiary sector. With the introduction of mass education in rural areas people, particularly the young, move into cities for a better life. The great majority of them are employed in the low value labour intensive industries. Also the vailability of raw material and cheap labour attracts MNCs to set up production of items such as textiles, shoes, furniture and assembling of electrical items. Local enterprises too set up such industries. Thus the proportion of employment rises in manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>At this stage of development countries experience boom in construction-housing and industrial estate. Governments also focus on developing infrastructure such as roads bridges and means of communication. Thus growing employment in manufacturing sector coupled with the rising incomes in general result in growing tertiary sector. New jobs are created in tertiary sector partly because of rising demand for services related to commerce and tourism in particular, and partly because government employs more people for many new industries and public utility providers are usually owned by the government.</p>
<p>As the country becomes highly developed the tertiary sector flourishes. In developed countries it accounts for over 50% of the GDP. Thus the structure of employment changes from large proportion of workforce engaged in manufacturing sector to the tertiary sector. Majority of the labour force is engaged in services like education, tourism, commerce, medical etc. Developed countries has the science and technology, knowhow and highly skilled labour force therefore they lose their comparative advantage in manufacturing of low value goods and export high-tech capital intensive goods. Thus proportion of employment is generally the lowest in primary sector because mechanized farming, for instance, makes it possible to run a large farm with just handful of workers. Highly sophisticated technology and the increasing use of automation reduce the proportion of labour in the manufacturing sector. Thus tertiary sector employs the largest proportion of the workforce.</p>
<p>So, as a country develops, the pattern of employment in different sectors of the economy changes, initially from primary to secondary and then to tertiary sector.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 51</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9412</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>An increase in investment will act as an injection into the circular flow of national income and, therefore, will generate a full multiplied rise in national income through what is known as the multiplier effect. The reason is that all the money gets spent and thus all of it goes to boosting aggregate demand. <br><br>The tendency for a change in injections or withdrawals to result in a greater change in national income is known as multiplier effect. In fact multiplier magnifies business activities initiated by changes in injections or withdrawals. In an open economy with government the value of multiplier can be estimated in advance by the formula:&nbsp;<br><br>K = 1/(Marginal propensity to withdraw (MPW)<br><br>MPW is the proportion of an increase in NY that is withdrawn from the circular flow. It is the sum of MPS, MPT and MPM. MPS represents marginal propensity to save, MPT indicates marginal propensity to tax and MPM relates to marginal propensity to imports. The higher the amount of withdrawals the lower is the multiplier effect. <br><br>The value of multiplier can also be found after the change in income has occurred by using the formula: <br>(change in real GDP )/(initial change in injection ) = ΔY/ΔJ<br><br>The multiplier effect occurs because a rise in investment spending will create incomes, some of which will in turn be spent and thereby create more incomes. Let us assume&nbsp;that the MPW = 1/2.&nbsp;This will give us an MPC =1/2.&nbsp;Let us also assume that there is an increase in planned investment in the economy of $10 billion. The rationale underlying the multiplier effect is illustrated numerically in the table below:&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/3458bb454f74d71bb8aafcd787d4e650" alt="" width="329" height="271"><br><br>To get an idea how a larger increase in income will result from a given increase in investment we can follow the progress of the increased injection around the circular flow of money. If say, firms planned to increase investment by $10 billion they need to employ thousands of engineers, technicians and workers and also need to buy machinery and raw material.<br><br>The new employees will now have wages, profits will have increased, and total income will have risen by the&nbsp;$10 billion as shown in the table. Assuming MPC = 1/2&nbsp;and MPW = 1/2,&nbsp;we know households will spend $5&nbsp;billion and the remaining $5 billion will be withdrawn as savings, imports and taxes. The addition to consumption further increases aggregate demand. This time, the&nbsp;firms producing consumer goods find sales rising and stocks falling. They will increase output, take on more labour, pay more in wages and earn more profit. If we continue to calculate increase in expenditure occurring as a result of this expansion in the economy we will be able to calculate final change in NY as worked out below:&nbsp;<br>2 = 1/0.5<br><br>Then initial change in injections is multiplied by the value of multiplier to calculate final change in national income. 10 x 2 = 20. <br>The effect is shown in the figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b4d9452aed5db38ffedcb72419e52f8a" alt="" width="424" height="135"><br><br>An increase in investment will raise the level of injections from J<sub>1</sub> to J<sub>2</sub>. Equilibrium will move from point a to point b. National income thus rises from Ye to Ye<sub>1</sub>. The multiplier is therefore: <br>K = ΔY/ΔJ<br><br>Hence, it follows that an increase in investment will cause a spending chain through the economy. That chain of spending, although of diminishing magnitude at each successive step, will cumulate to a multiple change in national income. <br><br>On the other hand a rise in saving could mean more funds available to lend which might allow investment to rise and economy to grow. However, if everyone saves more then consequently they spend less. Increased saving and low spending affects businesses. Less spending means less demand for goods and services and therefore lost orders for firms. Firms will cut back production and lay off workers. So the income of household will fall. This phenomenon is called paradox of thrift and is illustrated by the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/dbe436a579513efc2eb22b19a98e191a" alt="" width="363" height="214"><br><br>An increase in savings at all levels of income will lead to an upward shift in the savings function. Equilibrium income will fall from QA to OB. We know from the multiplier that the resulting fall in national income will be greater than the fall in spending because this means reduced injections into the economy as people spend less. Thus extra saving and less consumption would only make matters worse by lowering income and increasing unemployment.&nbsp;<br><br>From the above it follows that an increase in investment will bring a proportionately larger increase in national income, while a rise in savings will reduce national in- come by a larger proportion.</li>
<li>In the money market the condition for monetary equilibrium is that the rate of interest will be such that everyone is just willing to hold the existing supply of money, i.e., interest rate does the job of equating the quantity of money demanded to the available supply and hence produces monetary equilibrium. In the figure below, we see how the interest rate produces monetary equilibrium.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/eae6d0f6076ea39d25971d8c10610ddf" alt="" width="428" height="284"><br><br>Equilibrium is achieved with a rate of interest Re and the quantity of money Me. If the rate of interest were above Re, people would have money balances surplus to their needs. They would use these to buy securities and other assets. This would drive up the price of securities and drive down the rate of interest toward equilibrium. Similarly, if the rate of interest were below Re, people would have insufficient money balances. They would sell securities, thus lowering their prices and raising the rate of interest until it reached the equilibrium level.<br><br>Changes in money supply will affect national income via changes in the rate of interest. Let's assume that monetary authorities seek to adopt easy monetary measures and attempt to increase money supply, say, by lowering liquidity ratio of commercial banks or buying securities through open market operation.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1028dd550ae70a98508fa413ea6d2664" alt="" width="420" height="225"><br><br>These measures shift the supply curve of money from MS to MS<sub>1</sub> as shown in the first part of the graph. Consequently, there is excess supply of money at the existing rate of interest Re. People still wish to hold only Me of money balances, but Me<sub>1</sub> is now available.<br><br>In order to eliminate their excess holdings of money, People attempt to buy bonds and securities. This attempt of buying bonds and other financial assets increases their price and subsequently lowers the rate of interest. When interest has fallen to Re<sub>1</sub> the quantity of money demanded will have risen to equal the available supply of Me<sub>1</sub>. &nbsp;Monetary equilibrium is, thus re-estab- lished, though at a lower rate of interest.<br><br>The curve in the part 2 of the graph is called a marginal efficiency of investment curve (or just a demand for investment curve). MEC curve shows the relation between planned investment and the rate of interest, assuming all other things are equal. It is derived from prospective yield of one more unit of investment and the cost of obtaining it. Firms make their investment decisions by comparing MEC with the rate of interest. For instance, if the expected real net rate of return on an individual project (MEC) is greater than the real rate of interest, investment is profitable and hence is undertaken. Thus investment demand curve shows that the lower the rate of interest, the larger will be the number of investment opportunities that will show a profit and, hence, the larger the volume of investment expenditure that firms wish to undertake.<br><br>Note that, because both parts of the Figure above have the interest rate on the vertical axis, the interest rate can be compared between the two. Both parts show an initial equilibrium with the quantity of money of Me and an interest rate of Re. When the equilibrium is disturbed, say due to an increase in the money supply to MS<sub>1</sub>, the rate of interest falls to Re<sub>1</sub>. Part (ii) of the Figure tells us that the fall in the interest rate from Re to Re<sub>1</sub> increases desired investment expenditure from I<sub>0</sub> to I<sub>1</sub>.<br><br>So far, we have seen that an increase in the money supply leads to a fall in the interest rate which, in turn, results in an increase in desired investment expenditure. We extend our analysis to finally figure out how these changes subsequently affect NY. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/28664cfaefa7da68c2b1424f81816970" alt="" width="428" height="224"><br><br>Equilibrium NY can be found by W = J. The withdrawls function is the vertical sum of the net saving, net taxes and import functions. Similarly, the injection function is the vertical addition of the investment, government expenditure and export functions. Initially, the equilibrium can be located at point a, indicating Y<sub>1</sub> as the equilibrium level of NY. A rise in investment expenditure shifts the J function upwards and will cause NY to increase (Y<sub>1</sub> - Y<sub>2</sub>) by more than the increase in investment (be). The number of times that the increase in income (NY) is greater than the increase in investment is known as the multiplier (k).<br><br>So what causes the multiplier effect? The answer is that, any increase in injection into the economy will produce a stream of new incomes through additional spending. For example. if firms to invest more, this will lead to more people being employed and hence more incomes being paid to households. Households will then spend part of this increased income on domestically produced goods (the remainder will be withdrawn). This increased consumption will encourage firms to produce more goods to meet the demand. Firms will thus employ more people and other factors of production. This leads to even more incomes being paid out to households. Consumption will thus increase yet again, and so the process continues. <br><br>However lowering interest rate is not the only policy that can raise NY rather government can use a reflationary fiscal policy to achieve the same result. An expansionary or inflationary fiscal policy will involve raising government expenditure and/or lowering taxes this will have the effect of either increasing the budget deficit or reducing the budget surplus. It is where the government alters the balance between government expenditure (G) and taxation (T), and thereby alters the balance between injections and withdrawals. In this way it controls aggregate demand. Faced with a recession, it should raise G and I or lower T. In other words. the government should run a budget deficit rather than a balanced budget. There will then be a multiplier effect as shown by the sequence below: <br><br>↑G or&nbsp;↓T→J&gt;W→↑Y⇒↑W until J=W<br><br>Thus lowering interest rate is not the only policy option; rather government can also use reflationary fiscal policy or in order to increase national income.</li>

In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate is determined by the demand for and supply of labour. Many firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type of labour characterize this type of market. Also, there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product, MRPL, is the increase in revenue due to employing one more unit of labour. MRPL is determined by the MPPL (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied by the MR i.e., MRPL = MPPL x MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/aeb9506bd378ba60f4e531a3a715de6a" alt="" width="458" height="232"></p>
<p>In the figure above both equilibrium wage rate and level of employment are determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves as depicted in the left part of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this type of labor up to the point at which its marginal revenue product (MRPL) is equal to marginal cost of labour (MCL) shown in the right part of the graph.</p>
<p>Although economic theory of wage determination is primarily concerned with a perfectly competitive market, however, the theory could be extended to allow various market imperfections, which exist in real world. For instance, there may be a single buyer of labour - a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory is the main source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, then the wage rate, (ACL) is no longer reperesented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the wage rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence, monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market supply curve and in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the size of an employer's demand for labour will affect the wage rate. This is illustrated in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e825bf060af1bd258ef9e7fd312b0267" alt="" width="422" height="239"></p>
<p>The marginal cost curve for labour (MC<sub>L</sub>) being above the average cost curve for labour (AC<sub>L</sub>) can be explained by the use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £ 100, 50 workers may be employed. If however, the monopsonist wishes to employ one more worker he or is forced to offer £101, the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now £101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid to the 51 st worker plus £ 1 paid to each of the 50 original workers.</p>
<p>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ where the MC<sub>L</sub> is equal to the MRPL, i.e. point A, hence L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate, however, is given by the average cost curve S (AC<sub>L</sub>) and this will be W<sub>1</sub>. The overall wage bill to the monopsonist will, therefore, be OW<sub>1</sub>BL<sub>1</sub>. In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony market the wage and numbers being employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. Thus monopsony power in a labour market will result in a lower level of employment and lower wages than would exist in a competitive labour market.</p>
<p>However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment can be corrected by incorporating trade unions or government.</p>
<p>Trade unions seek to increase the wage rate of their members by either restricting the supply of labour (explained in part a) or by direct negotiation. Collective bargaining involves wage negotiation between trade unions, acting on behalf of their members, and the employers. Successful bargaining could raise the wage rate, as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/07d0bae12f88eddd887f7de61e2b50f9" alt="" width="360" height="254"></p>
<p>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. The entry of a trade union to the industry, which sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, will kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal cost curve of labour. <br>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub> workers.</p>
<p>Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually employs more workers. It is only when the union forces the wage rate above W<sub>3</sub> that employment starts to fall. Minimum wage fixed by the government will also produce the same result.</p>
<p>Thus a comparison of wage rate between perfect and imperfect market ascertain the opinion. However, a strong trade unions or government can reduce and in some cases completely eliminate the wage difference.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 53</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9402</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the economic theory of profit maximisation for a firm and consider whether firms are likely to follow this theory in fixing their price and output.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The traditional theory of the firm tends to make a standard assumption that businesses possess the information, market power and motivation to set a price and output that maximises profits in the short or long run.</p>
<p>Economic theory of profit maximsation suggests that if a firm decides that production is worth under taking, it must then decide how much to produce in order to earn maximum possible profits. The key to decide the level of output is that the firm should carry out an analysis on a unit-by-unit basis. If any unit of production adds more to revenue than it does to cost, producing and selling that unit will increase profits. However, if any unit adds more to cost than it does to revenue, producing and selling that unit will decrease profits. In economic terminology, a unit of production raises profits if the marginal revenue (MR) obtained from selling it exceeds the marginal cost (MC) of producing it. Alternatively it lowers profits if MR is less than MC of producing it.</p>
<p>Thus we say that if MR is greater than MC the firm should expand its output. However, if the firm's MR is less than MC the firm should reduce its output. From this it follows that firm maximizes profits at the level of output where its MR= MC. Any output below this, the firm is sacrificing potential profit, whilst any output above it is being sold at a loss, reducing the firm's total profit. Profit maximization therefore is an ideal for firms to work to.</p>
<p>A criticism of the traditional profit maximizing theory sometimes put forward is that firms do not use MR and MC concepts. It is argued that, in practice, it may be difficult to apply mainly because of inability of firms to calculate MC and MR with precision. Instead the firms prefer to simply work out the cost per unit and add on a profit margin in order to determine the selling price. The cost plus pricing is unlikely to result in maximum profit, although it could produce a high level of profit.</p>
<p>The main difficulty in trying to maximise profits using MC and MR approach is a lack of information. Firms may well use accountants' cost concepts not based on opportunity cost. In such a case it is impossible to measure true profit.</p>
<p>More importantly, firms are unlikely to know precisely (or even approximately) their demand curves and hence their MR curves. Even though they will know how much they are selling at the moment, this only gives them one point on their demand curve and no point at all on their MR curve. In order to make even an informed guess of marginal revenue they must have some idea of how responsive demand will be to a change in price.</p>
<p>Market research may help. But even this is frequently very unreliable. Such information takes time to acquire and action, by which time market conditions may have changed, thus making the information out of date.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in estimating the firm's demand curve is in estimating the actions and reactions of other firms and their effects. Collusion between oligopolists or price leadership would help, but there will still be a considerable area of uncertainty, especially if the firm faces competition from abroad. Even other industries' product may be substitutes or complements to some degree, thus will affect the price elasticity of demand for firm's product.<br>Finally there is the problem of deciding the time period over which the firm should be seeking to maximise profits. Firms operate in a changing environment. Demand curves shift; supply curves shift. Some of these shifts occur as a result of factors outside the firm's control, such as changes in competitors' prices and products, or changes in technology. Some, however, change as a direct result of a firm's policies, such as an advertising campaign, the development of a new improved product, or the installation of new equipment. The firm is not, therefore, faced with static cost and revenue curves from which it can read off its.<br>The assumption of profit maximization is now criticised by economists who believe that modern corporations are complex organizations made up of various groups or stakeholders such as, employees, managers, shareholders and authorities. Each of these groups is likely to have different goals at different points in time. The dominant group at any moment in time can give greater emphasis to their own objectives - for example price and output decisions may be taken at local level by managers - with shareholders taking only a distant and imperfectly informed view of the company's performance and strategy.</p>
<p>These economists argue that a business might have profitability as an important long term aim; it might depart from this in the short term in order to achieve a variety of different objectives.</p>
<p>For instance, a firm choosing to maximize sales revenue would raise output beyond MC = MR until MR had fallen to zero. In this case the firm may be willing to accept lower short term profit in order to increase its share of the market. This is also possible when businesses correlate annual raise in salaries and other perks with total sales revenue and rapid growth rather than profits. Hence managers may be assumed to want to maximize their own utility by perusing sales revenue maximization and growth.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the firm might opt to maximize the volume of sales rather than sales revenue. In this option the firm would increase output up to the break-even level where the total revenue just covered the total cost. A higher output implies loss-making behaviour. The only situation where this would be possible is where the firm could use the profit from some other activities to cover these losses, using the principle of cross subsidisation. The most likely motive for loss-making behaviour is to gain a toehold in a new market or to deter new entrants into an existing one.</p>
<p>Satisficing behaviour would occur when a firm is determined to make a reasonable level of profits to satisfy the shareholders but also to keep the other stakeholders happy. It may choose to sacrifice profit in order to improve the workforce's pay and conditions or to keep&nbsp;prices down for the benefit of consumers. Satisficing can also be a feature of firms that have enjoyed a high market share over a long period of time. Complacency can lead to firms losing their focus on the cost structure or failing to devote resources to either product or process innovation. Either situation can lead to a loss of profits. Also some firms may have charitable or environmental objectives, which must be financed at the cost of profit.</p>
<p>In conclusion, practically the objectives and targets of a corporation or small enterprise will evolve to meet changing economic conditions. But as a working assumption, it is still valid to see profit maximization as the major long term objective influencing firm's competitive behaviour.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 54</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9401</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether it is always advantageous for a firm to grow in size.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>There are a number of reasons for a firm to wish to grow. In most cases firms target growth as their objective in order to reduce their average costs and hence take advantage of economies of scale. Economies of scale have the effect of increasing the productive capacity of the&nbsp;business and they help to raise profit margins. They also give a business a competitive edge in domestic and international markets. In other cases firms may wish to grow to increase their market dominance thereby giving them increased pricing power in specific markets. Monopolies for example can engage in price discrimination. Also the expansion of a business might be motivated by a desire to diversify production and sales so that falling sales in one market might be compensated by healthier demand and output in another market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever motivates a firm to grow, the impact can be explained on the firm's long run average cost curve. A long run average cost curve (LRAC) shows how per unit cost varies with output on the assumption that the least cost method of production will be chosen for each level of output. If the firm experiences economies of scale its LRAC curve will fall but if diseconomies of scale predominate, the LRAC curve will rise. If the firm experiences neither of them, the LRAC curve will be horizontal as shown in the figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e32fc670eb5fbed36413760866b0ca1f" alt="" width="432" height="244"><br><br>In the figure above, initially an expansion of output over time leads to a reduction in the unit costs. These cost saving benefits are referred to as economies of scale. They occur because initially the firm's output rises proportionately faster than the inputs. These benefits come in a variety of ways known as technical, marketing, financial, managerial and risk bearing economies.</p>
<p>Firstly the firm gains from technical economies. As a firm grows in size it may be able to take advantage of increased specialisation. If the firm produces only a small output it may not be possible to employ a worker solely on one process but as the level of production increases workers may be able to specialise, leading to a lowering of the firm's costs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the firm can reduce its per unit costs through what is known as increased dimensions. For example, if the size of a container is doubled its surface area is increased 4 fold and its volume is increased 8 fold. It is possible, therefore, to obtain cost savings by making use of larger containers, say, for the storage or distribution of finished products since the cost per unit will fall. A large firm may also devote proportionately more resources to research and development which could lead to an improvement in the quality of the goods and services produced, and possibly to a lowering of the cost per unit.</p>
<p>Firm also gains on marketing its products. For instance, when a firm buys its raw materials in bulk it may obtain preferential terms in the form of a discount, thus reducing the cost of each unit. A large firm may employ specialist buyers whose sole responsibility it is to purchase raw materials at the cheapest price. Administration, advertising, and packaging costs may also be lower for larger companies since they can spread the cost over larger orders. For example, the packaging costs per item for 1 million units is likely to be substantially lower than if 100 items were packaged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the financial front larger firms may be able to obtain finance on favourable terms, obtaining loans from financial institutions at lower rates of interest. Banks will be more willing to give loan on preferential terms to a large, well-known company, which can ofter more collateral as security for the loan, than it will to a smaller company.</p>
<p>In addition the large firms normally produce more than one product and therefore take advantage of economies of scope. Economies of scope refer to the reduction in average total cost (ATC) made possible by a firm increasing the number of different goods it produces. The reason is that the firm is able to take advantage of skilled staff and technology which can be shared by the different goods produced.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, with the firm experiencing diseconomies of scale its average costs may increase. These diseconomies of scale also come in a variety of different ways. For instance, as a firm grows in size it will possibly have a larger management team and, unlike a small firm, it will find it difficult to make decisions quickly. This can often be the case where companies have merged and there are two sets of management with different ideas. It may be difficult to coordinate planning, marketing, production and so on, with a resulting increase in the company's cost per unit.</p>
<p>Moreover the workforce may feel remote and alienated from the management. They may find their jobs boring and repetitive, particularly if mass production methods are used, and this may result in low morale and poor motivation. There may be a feeling on the part of the workforce that they are not part of the firm and this may lead to a deterioration in the quality of work undertaken. A 'them and us' situation may also develop between the management and the workforce, possibly resulting in an increase in the number of industrial disputes.</p>
<p>It is incontestable that nowadays, firms that operate on a large scale and can thereby maximise the potential of economies of scale and scope. However, economic realities also mean that amidst the big firms there are small businesses competing in the same markets and industries.</p>
<p>One cannot ignore the impact of specialisation and quality. While firms that exploit economies of scale and can become major players in an industry as a whole, there is always room for countless small firms to find a niche in which they can perform better than any other firm, including the biggest ones. A great example of this is in the financial services industry. There are several large players - Citigroup, AIG, Bank of America, HSBC, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan - however there also exist myriad small businesses that have a niche (often very obscure) in which they can perform better than anyone else.</p>
<p>Also the continued survival of small firms in markets where large firms might dominate is caused by the size of the market itself and the factors such as demand for specialised or high-quality product, that can not necessarily be answered by large firms capable of exploiting economies of scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus the growth of firm is not always advantageous rather large firms are prone to suffer from disadvantages when they grow in size larger than the optimum.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 55</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9397</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether you agree with the opinion that a trade union might be able to achieve higher wages for its members but only by causing some unemployment.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wage is the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply of labour. The theory, however, could be extended to allow various real world market imperfections. There may be, for instance, a single buyer of labour - a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory is the main source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, then the monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market supply curve of labour. It, therefore, suggests that in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the monopsonist's demand for labour will affect the wage rate.</p>
<p>Monopsonist's demand for labor curve is found by measuring marginal revenue product of each additional worker (MRP<sub>L</sub>). The marginal revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is the increase in revenue that results from employing one more worker and it is obtained by multiplying marginal physical product of labour (MPP<sub>L</sub>) with the firm's marginal revenue (MR). Thus MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR. MPP<sub>L</sub> is the increase in total output when one more worker is employed and is subject to the law of diminishing returns while MR is determined by the price of the finished product. This is illustrated in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/edeb01a075d2d640c1f8dca8eeb200e2" alt="" width="339" height="214"></p>
<p>The higher MC<sub>L</sub> than AC<sub>L</sub> can be explained by the use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £ 100, 50 workers may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to employ one more worker he is forced to offer £ 101, the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now £ 101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid to the 51<sup>st</sup> worker plus £ 1 paid to each of the 50 original workers.</p>
<p>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ where its MC<sub>L</sub> equals MRP<sub>L</sub>, indicated by point A in the graph, hence L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate W<sub>1</sub>, &nbsp;however, is given by the S curve (AC <sub>L</sub>). In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony market the wage and numbers being employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. Thus monopsony power in a labour market will result in a lower level of employment and lower wages than would exist in a competitive labour market. However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment can be corrected by incorporating trade unions.</p>
<p>Trade unions are made up of groups of workers who have a common interest. This could be a common skill, a similar job or working in the same industry. The aims of a trade union can range from improving the working environment to taking up the case of those members the&nbsp;union sees as being unfairly dismissed. An important function is to increase the wage rate of its members and trade unions, more often than not, seek to achieve that objective through collective bargaining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collective bargaining involves the direct negotiation between a trade union, on behalf of its members, and the employer(s). Suppose that the workers in an industry organize themselves under a single union so that the monopsonist employer now faces a monopoly union - a bilateral monopoly. In this case the two sides will settle the wage through collective bargaining. The outcome of bargaining depends on the objective and strength of each side as shown in the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c59730917574a40c4c8d7fde83215b44" alt="" width="292" height="209"></p>
<p>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. Under these circumstances the income represented by the area W<sub>2</sub> ABC reflects worker's exploitation and therefore it becomes a zone of bargaining between employer and union. Now let's assume that a successful resistance from the trade union sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, which will kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal cost curve of labour.</p>
<p>At W<sub>3</sub> wage rate the monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub> workers. Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually employs more workers. It is only when the union forces the wage rate above W<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;that employment starts to fall.</p>
<p>Thus it follows that a trade union might be able to achieve higher wages and more employment for its members. It, however, depends on and how large is the bargaining zone and where the wage rate has been fixed.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 56</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9387</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Distinguish between supernormal profit and economic rent and consider the circumstances when each occurs.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Supernormal profit refers to a firm's earnings over and above what is needed keep its resources in their present use. Now the minimum that a firm must earn in order to remain in the present business is known as normal profit. This in effect refers to the opportunity cost of all its resources being used at present. On the other hand economic rent is the excess that an input earns over the minimum amount needed to keep it in its present use. In effect it is the opportunity cost of its present job that is known as transfer earnings. This is similar to supernormal profit in that it refers to the surplus over the opportunity cost. It is different, however, from supernormal profit as it refers to the surplus over the opportunity cost of a resource while supernormal profit is the surplus over the opportunity of doing a business.</p>
<p>In their pursuit of maximizing profit all firms, regardless the type of market, produce an output where they equate marginal revenue (MR) with their marginal cost (MC). At that point the level of profit, however, may range from supernormal to normal and sub normal, depending on the degree of competition that may exist in different markets. Firms earn normal profit when their average&nbsp;cost (AC) just equals average revenue (AR). Thus AR &gt; AC, indicates supernormal profit. Supernormal profit, in the long run, is usually associated with the industries marked with entry and exit barriers such as monopolies and oligopolies. These barriers may range from high capital cost, economies of scale, sunk cost and various marketing and legal barriers. In a perfect market, however, firms may earn supernormal profit in the short run while this possibility is ruled out in the long run due to the absence of entry barriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditions in a perfectly competitive market lead to all firms being price takers with a perfectly elastic demand curve for their product. So, each individual firm maximizes profit by adjusting its output to the point where its marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In such conditions profit may range from abnormal, normal and subnormal in the short run. However, due to the absence of entry barriers, profit is maintained at the normal level in the long run. The graph below illustrates this; <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/97543413ac64f086245301fa2bfaa63e" alt="" width="510" height="202"><br><br>In the short run, the interaction between demand and supply determines the market-clearing price OP. Let's now assume that an increase in the market demand to D<sub>1</sub> raises the price to P<sub>1</sub> and thus creates an opportunity to earn supernormal profit. The industry offering supernormal profits encourages the entry of new firms into the industry. This causes an outward shift in market supply that forces the price down until price = long run average cost. At this point, each firm in the industry is just making normal profit. So, firms in a perfectly competitive market do earn supernormal profit for a short while, the entry of new firms, however, erodes this in the long run.</p>
<p>In cases of monopolies and oligopolies firms may earn supernormal profit both in the short and long run. A monopolist, knowing that entry of new firms is restricted by effective entry barriers; continue to charge a high price that yields supernormal profit. This can be shown on the graph below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d14133d35d61af63f34b894b8433fe45" alt="" width="349" height="290"><br><br>At the profit maximizing output Oq, the shaded rectangle measured by the vertical difference between monopolists' AR and AC is marked as supernormal profit that can occur both in the short and long run.</p>
<p>In order to analyze economic rent we use market demand and supply of an input, say labour. The graph below illustrates economic rent earned by the workers in a labour market.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ca2d0adfb3b3a25c1852d3ced2bd9914" alt="" width="352" height="268"><br><br>At the equilibrium wage Ow the industry employs ON workers. The supply curve indicates the number of workers available at each and every wage rate. It, therefore, represents the minimum that each of them must earn in order to remain in the same occupation. So, out of the total earnings OweN, the triangular area eaw, which is above the supply curve and below the wage rate, represents the surplus over what is needed to keep all these workers in their present jobs. The area OaeN, therefore represents their opportunity cost or transfer earnings.</p>
<p>The amount of economic rent, however depends on the elasticity of supply of a factor. In order to analyze this consider the graphs below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6e410abb7dda0d545324afad0e2db3e7" alt="" width="378" height="257"><br><br>The two supply curves S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> represent different elasticity conditions where wage rate is same in both cases. It can be noted that when the supply curve is vertical the entire area represents economic rent because a decrease in wage rate would not lead to any worker to move elsewhere. This is the case where workers possibly do not have alternative job availability anywhere. When the supply curve is horizontal the entire area O we N represents transfer earnings and therefore economic rent is zero. In this case a fraction decrease in wage rate would lead all the workers to move elsewhere as earnings from alternative jobs are the same as earnings from their present jobs. Thus it follows that economic rent changes due to a change in the elasticity of supply. The higher the PES the lower is the economic rent and vice versa.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 57</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9386</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Businesses say that high interest rates are not desirable because they prevent investment.

It can be undertaken by either the private or the public sectors, and can involve the purchase of new plant and machinery, the building of new houses, factories or schools and the construction of roads and reservoirs. Net additions to stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods are also classed as investment. Note that investment is not the buying and selling of stocks and shares or the placing of money in a bank account.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between net investment and replacement investment. The former increases capital stock and the latter simply maintains capital stock. The two together constitute gross investment.</p>
<p>The decision taken by private businesses to invest is likely to be based on different criteria to those of the public sector. Profit is an important factor in private sector investment, whereas public sector investment can be a political or social decision.</p>
<p>When a private firm purchases a new machine, the expectation is that the return from the investment will be greater than the cost of buying machine. The expected yield is difficult to calculate since it will occur over a number of years. Also, a given sum of money received next year will be worth less than the same sum received now. Therefore, it is usual to discount the values of expected returns across many years in future to their present values and to express them over the initial cost as a rate. This rate will be referred to as the marginal efficiency capital (MEC). Thus if the MEC is greater than the real rate of interest the investment should precede. The relationship between MEC and rate of interest is illustrated in the figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1db7d1e34c00e6215b075e4dec24fb78" alt="" width="326" height="237"><br><br>By investing, a firm can build up a stock of capital goods and, as with labour, capital is subject to the law of diminishing returns so the MEC will fall. So long as the MEC is greater than the rate of interest, the investment is worthwhile. In figure above, investment should cease once k<sub>1</sub> is reached at an interest rate r<sub>1</sub>. &nbsp;A fall in the rate of interest to r<sub>2</sub> will lead to a rise in the capital stock from k<sub>1</sub> to k<sub>2</sub>. The increase in capital stock, k<sub>2</sub> - k<sub>1</sub>, will require new investment to take place. The size of the capital stock, therefore, varies with the rate of interest.</p>
<p>In our explanation above, the rate of interest was assumed to be the rate at which firms have to borrow money. However, a large part of investment by firms is financed from retained profit. This does not alter the relationship between the rate of interest and investment. Thus, the higher the rate of interest on savings, the higher the opportunity cost of investment and hence the lower will be the amount of planned investment in the economy.</p>
<p>Although rate of interest is the main factor influencing investment but several other factors can also lead to a change in investment. For instance, if business executives become more optimistic about future business, the planned investment curve will shift to the right; a pessimistic outlook will shift it to the left. Business expectations may be based on changes in the domestic political and economic climate, international relations, population growth and stock market conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a rapid rate of technological progress stimulates investment. The development of a more efficient machine, for example, will lower production costs, increasing the expected rate of net profit from investing in new machine.</p>
<p>It, therefore, follows that interest rate plays a pivotal role in making investment decisions and a high interest rate increases the cost of doing business therefore it discourages investment. It, however, may not prevent it because investment decisions are not solely based on the rate of interest. Businesses rather consider a number of different factors in conjunction with interest rate.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates are part of central bank's deflationary monetary policy. Therefore it is also true that high interest rates sometimes are necessary and they can play a vital role in removing inflationary pressure and more so in correcting a country's trade position through encouraging people to cut their overall spending. Central bank influences the rate of interest directly by increasing its base rate or indirectly by reducing money supply in the economy. It is a typical response of a central bank in times of high rate of inflation. This is because a high rate of inflation reduces the real interest or sometime changes it into negative that discourages people from saving and therefore leads to even higher consumer expenditure leading to even higher rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Consumption in economics is spending on consumer goods and services over a period of time. Saving on the other hand is what is not spent out of disposable income. Both consumption and saving simultaneously respond to the changes in interest rate though in opposite directions. Interest rate is the opportunity cost of present consumption because households can earn a return on the same amount of money that they spend but that is only when they save it. It, therefore, follows that the higher the rate of interest the higher is the opportunity of present consumption and therefore the households, in order to take advantage of higher return on their savings, would be encouraged to cut their spending on consumer goods and save more. Moreover much of the money&nbsp;that the households borrow is for the purpose of buying durables such as cars, furniture, house etc. A higher interest rate effectively increases their prices as now they need to pay a higher amount that is over and above the actual prices. So the households are expected to react to this by reducing their demand for durables that in return can reduce the demand pressure leading to a fall the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>A relatively higher interest rate also improves a country's trade position as it can reduce spending on imports thus improving its trade balance. However the extent to which it affects imports depends on the price elasticity of demand for imports. Moreover, the higher interest rate may also result in an increase in capital flows into the economy. Therefore it is likely to have a favourable impact on the country's balance of payment position. This, however, can only be achieved when the country's interest rate is relatively higher than those of others.</p>
<p>So, at times when the economy goes through a phase of high rate of inflation accompanied by a worsening of its trade position it becomes necessary for the central bank to maintain high rates of interest that can encourage people to spend less and therefore to save more. Thus it can be concluded that both views can be correct but which is more appropriate depends on the current economic situation.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 58</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9382</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The government of your country wants to know how the economy compares with other countries' economies.<br>Discuss which economic indicators it should obtain and how reliable they might be as a basis for such a comparison.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A cross-country-comparison of standard of living would help the government of a country to judge how the economy is compared with other countries' economies. Standard of living is a measure of the material welfare of the inhabitants of a country. The baseline measure of the standard of living is real GDP. This is the value of total output produced from all the resources located within the political borders of a country over one year time period adjusted for any changes in the price level. A cross-country comparison, however, requires converting the real GDP data into a common currency normally the dollar or the Euro. <br>Despite making these adjustments it must be remembered that real GDP on its own is both an inaccurate and insufficient indicator of true living standards both within and between countries. The GDP figures would become more useful if the figures of population of each of the countries is taken into account because all countries have different sizes of population. India's GDP, for example, needed to be divided on a population of approximately 1.25 billion to arrive at their GDP per head figure. On the other hand the GDP of Mauritius only needed to be divided on a population of approximately 1.2 million. The result in terms of GDP per head can be different from those of flat GDP figure. As real GDP per head is calculated by dividing GDP on the population of the country therefore it is a measure of how much of real goods and services is available to the average citizen for consumption and investment. It is believed that there should be a strong positive correlation between RGDP per capita and economic well being; that is, greater production should move society toward" the good life". Therefore economists view levels and rates of growth of "real" per&nbsp;capita GDP, expressed in common currency, as a better indicator of comparing economic well being internationally than GDP figures alone.<br>Economists, however argue that higher GDP per head does not necessarily imply that the citizens of a country enjoy higher living standard. It is widely held that RGDP per head is also of limited value for inter- country comparison of living standard for a number of reasons. <br>Firstly, income distributions between the countries may be different also national income accounts will have varying degrees of inaccuracy, caused, for instance, by different sizes of the informal economy in each country. The informal or black economy includes economic activity that goes unrecorded. The non-monetised sectors of the economy include output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed products. Economist's latest estimates for the total value of the black economy through out the world are $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. National income accounting conventions may also be different in different countries making it impossible to compare the two. <br>There is also the problem of what rate of exchange to use when comparing one country's GDP with another. The day to day market exchange rate can bear little relation to relative prices in different countries. So prices in some countries, like Switzerland or West Germany, can be much higher at official exchange rates than in France or Italy. Therefore if national income statistics are to be used to compare living standards between countries it is important to use an exchange rate which compares the cost of living in each country. These exchange rates are known as purchasing power parities. If, for instance, a typical basket of goods costs 10 Euro in France and £ 7 in the UK, then national income should be converted at an exchange rate of 10 Euro to the £ 7 even if the market exchange rate gives a very different figure. <br>Even this is not accurate enough. In some countries, consumers have to purchase goods which in others are free. Sweden, for instance, spends a greater proportion of its national income than Italy on fuel for heating because of its colder climate. But this extra expenditure does not give the Swedes a higher standard of living. Again, countries are different geographically and one country might have higher transport costs per unit of output than another because of congestion or having to transport goods long distances. In practice, it is almost impossible to adjust national income figures for these sorts of differences. <br>It is believed that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being as a nation in comparison with other countries. Economists point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off than other countries without necessarily achieving higher RGDP per head, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse. Similarly, rising RGDP per head is usually accompanied by rising external cost, such as pollution, noise and accidents. These are not officially measured within national income but they do affect welfare and distort comparison of well-being between nations. <br>Understanding the fact that the data on real GDP per head is of limited value for comparing living standard between countries economists have developed many alternative measures. Measure of economic welfare (MEW), for instance, was developed to overcome these problems. This starts with real GNP and NNP. To this we added an allowance for leisure, for various non-marketedg oods and services such as houseworka nd underground activities, for the serviceso f various publica menitiess uch as parks and roads, and for privated urable goods such as furniture and jewellery. On the other hand, various items are subtracted. These include 'regrettables' such as expenditure on defence and commuting to work, and various 'bads' such as pollution. Also various intermediatei tems such as the benefits of education are subtracted.<br>The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies around the world.<br>The most well-known measure of quality of life is the Human Development Index (HDI) that has been developed under the United Nations Development Programme. HDI is the average of three indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)</li>
<li>Life expectancy at birth, in years</li>
<li>Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight)</li>
</ul>
<p>The closer the HDI value to 1, the nearer is the country to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators. The advantage of using HDI is that it highlights the fact that people's welfare is influenced not only by the goods and services available but also by their ability to lead a long and healthy life and to acquire knowledge, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative factors. Clearly, this index gives us a better way of estimating standards of living than just the real GDP per head. Though it is considered to be a superior measure to others yet it is still far from being perfect.<br>Economists have recently been looking at ways to include other factors in the measurement, such as income distribution, gender inequalities, and inequalities by region or by ethnic group. As a result they have developed The Human Poverty Index (HPI) that focuses on four basic dimensions of human life - longevity, knowledge, economic provisioning and social inclusion. <br>Thus it follows that a government can adopt various measures in order to determine how an economy is compared to other economies. Each of those measures, however, has its own inherent weaknesses as none can actually produce a perfectly accurate cross-country comparison of economic well being. For a cross country comparison of economic well being the popular opinion, however, is more in favour of HDI.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 59</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9379</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>A worker is a weekly paid shop assistant.

The higher the income they earn the more they are likely to spend and therefore the higher is their transactionary demand for money. Similarly the less frequently they are paid, the greater the level of money balances they will tend to hold.</p>
<p>In the given situation the worker has been promoted from the shop assistant to a manager in a large store and she is entitled to receive monthly salary as opposed to weekly wages therefore her transactionary demand for money is expected to increase as shown in the graph below;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1882dc3f4e7288700a427fb517461acd" alt="" width="318" height="239"></p>
<p>If, for example, she was paid $200 per week and she was spending all $200 by the end of week and her expenditure were spread evenly over the week then on average she was holding roughly $100 in cash; that is midway between pay days. Now she is paid a higher monthly income say $1000, therefore she will have roughly $500 cash on average; that is mid-month. This increase in her cash balances is reflected in a rightward shift in the MD curve and it has resulted partly due to an increase in her income and partly due to the longer interval with which she will be paid as a manger.</p>
<p>The effect, however may be opposite if her income now allows her to obtain facilities such as debit or credit cards. This is because paying once a month for goods requires less money on average than paying separately for each item purchased. Also it may reduce or eliminate the need to hold cash for precautionary motive. So if she uses these banking instruments more frequently than her cash holding my actually decline.</p>
<p>A fall in interest rate is also likely to affect her active cash balance, albeit rather small. At lower rate she may choose to spend more and save less of her income. Also this may encourage her to borrow and spend more.</p>
<p>A fall in interest rate, however would affect her specu- lative demand for money. Speculative demand for money refers to holding cash with the purpose to buy financial assets such as bonds, shares or foreign currencies and is referred to as idle balances.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a16e38ff12dc3ff06cbd8c617741dec9" alt="" width="369" height="223"></p>
<p>Since market prices of assets such as government securities vary inversely with the rate of interest, therefore a fall in the rate of interest will increase their prices and if she holds these assets then she will probably sell them while their prices are higher, hoping to buy them back again when interest rate rises and their prices fall. In the meantime she will hold cash balances. So, fall in interest rate is likely to increase her demand for money for speculative motive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If she is living in an open economy where large-scale movement of currencies across the foreign exchange takes place, expectations about changes in exchange rates is a major determinant of the speculative demand for money. A fall in interest rate will result in outflow of capital therefore it will drive the exchange rate down. This will increase speculative demand for the country's currency hoping that when interest rate rises in future the currency will appreciate in value. <br>So when interest rate falls not only she will hold money in anticipation of a fall in securities prices, but she will also hold higher speculative balances in anticipation of an appreciation of the exchange rate.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 60</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9378</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the motives for the demand for money according to the Keynesian liquidity preference theory.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The demand for money refers to the amount of wealth everyone in the economy wishes to hold in the form of money balances. In the Keynesian analysis of the rate of interest, demand for money is not based purely on the demand for new capital goods. In fact, Keynes argued that there are three distinct motives for preferring to hold wealth in the form of money as opposed to holding either non-money financial assets or physical assets.</p>
<p>Individuals need to hold money in order to meet daily transactions such as buying petrol, paying for groceries or purchasing a newspaper. Money balances held for this purpose is called transaction demand for money. Everyone will hold a certain amount of money since they are normally paid weekly or monthly whereas their expenditure is spread over the whole period. The average amount held for transactions purposes depends upon the level of money income, the price level, the time of the year and the frequency of pay days. In terms of money income, the higher the money income, the more likely the individual is to purchase more goods and services,a nd therefore require extra transactionsb alances. If the price level increases the demand for money for transactions purposes will be higher. In the case of the frequency of pay days, the more frequent, the lower the transactions demand for money.</p>
<p>The demand for money is also based on the desire to provide for the unexpected. The precautionary demand for money allows the individual to cover unforeseen events, such as the car breaking down, a lengthy period off work through illness, or an unexpected redundancy. It is likely to be the case that as the rate of interest increases, the precautionary demand for money will fall as individuals place their money in interest-bearing assets, i.e. the cost of holding money has increased.</p>
<p>Money balances held for these two purposes is called active balances (L<sub>1</sub>) i.e. money to be used as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/67fe0f59cbc43febe407053dc1c1f360" alt="" width="307" height="226"></p>
<p>Speculative demand for money is based on the expectation of making a speculative gain or avoiding a loss. Money balances held for this purpose are called idle balances (L<sub>2</sub>). Keynes outlined the speculative demand for money in terms of the desire to hold money or fixed income bonds. It is important to note that the price of bonds and the rate of interest are inversely related. When the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly high by individuals they will assume that the next move is in a downward direction. As stated, when the rate of interest falls the price of bonds increases and so there are capital&nbsp;gains to be made. This being so, when the rate of interest is high there will be a substantial demand for bonds and hence a low speculative demand to hold money. If, however, the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly low then individuals will assume that the next move is upwards, resulting in a fall in bond prices and, therefore, a capital loss for those who own bonds. If this is the case, the demand for bonds is likely to be low and those owning bonds will be looking to sell them before the price falls. In this situation the speculative demand for money will be high as shown in the graph below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e2e08ea2db0b5e210461b39ca10e1eb9" alt="" width="323" height="203"></p>
<p>The total demand for money LP is plotted against the rate of interest (r). This is found by the horizontal addition of curves L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/3e1fc1db9807e700bd6844ed31a93305" alt="" width="315" height="199"></p>
<p>A change in interest rate causes movement along the demand for money curve upward or downward.</p>
<p>Any factor other than a change in interest rates, that causes the demand for money to change will shift the LP curve to the rightward or leftward. For example, a rise in national income or price level will cause L<sub>1</sub> to increase, and thus LP will shift to the right and vice versa.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 61</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9377</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'Firms undertake vertical and horizontal integration to grow in size.

<p>Consider whether economies of scale are always caused by integration and whether, therefore, there is no place for small firms in a modern economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Firms can grow in size either by investment in new plants and machines that is known as internal growth or else they can opt for some form of integration that is called external growth. In many cases firms target growth through integration in order to reduce their average costs and hence take advantage of economies of scale. These advantages come in a variety of ways known as technical, marketing, financial, managerial and risk bearing economies.</p>
<p>As a firm grows in size it may, for instance, benefit from increased specialization. The firm may also gain on marketing its products. When, for instance, a firm buys its raw materials in bulk it may obtain preferential terms in the form of a discount, thus reducing the cost of each unit. On the financial front a larger firm may be able to obtain finance on favourable terms, obtaining loans from financial institutions at lower rates of interest. In addition to this a large firm normally produces more than one product and therefore takes advantage of economies of scope. Economies of scope refer to the reduction in average total cost (ATC) made possible by a firm increasing the number of different goods it produces. The reason is that the firm is able to take advantage of skilled staff and technology which can be shared by the different goods produced.</p>
<p>Economies of scale have the effect of increasing the productive capacity of the business and they help to raise profit margins. They also give a business a competitive edge in domestic and international markets. However there are a number of other reasons for firms to wish to become large through integration. Taking&nbsp;advantage of economies of scale is only one of them and it is not necessarily achieved only through integration. In fact it can be achieved by internal growth as much as through integration. In other cases firms may wish to become large to increase their market dominance thereby giving them increased pricing power in specific markets. Monopolies for example can engage in price discrimination. Also the expansion of a business might be motivated by a desire to diversify production and sales so that falling sales in one market might be compensated by healthier demand and output in another market. Usually the underlying objective of integration is to achieve a rapid growth of market. This usually is typical with manager-controlled businesses where the annual salaries and other perks might be more closely correlated with total sales revenue rather than profits.</p>
<p>So firms achieve growth by integration for a variety of different purposes and achieving economies of scale is just one of them.</p>
<p>Secondly it is true that firms through growth manage to gain cost advantages that they can use them to drive the small firms out of the industry who normally don't have the same advantages. However, it is also true that small firms such as sole traders and many partnerships, while operating with the view to maximize profit, prefer to remain small and survive successfully. One of the prime reasons for this continued existence of small concerns is the desire to be one's own boss; once this desire is met entrepreneurs may be content with a relatively quiet life and achievement of a satisfactory level of profit. Not only this the firm may remain small in order to take advantage of a low price elasticity of demand and high income elasticity of demand for specialist 'niche' goods and services - these products can be sold at a higher price and with a bigger profit margin. Also some firms remain small because they can avoid diseconomies of scale associated with larger firms. Other small firms survive because they assist the larger firms by producing some components of their products at relatively lower cost.</p>
<p>So we conclude that there is a possibility of firms achieving economies of scale regardless of the method they choose for their growth. Secondly whether integration takes effect into economies of scale is also uncertain; there is, therefore, room for small firms to survive successfully.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 62</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9376</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the meaning of, and the relationship between, diminishing returns, total product and marginal cost.

Short run is the time period when at least one factor of production is fixed in supply and the law states that when increasing amounts of a variable factor are used with a given amount of a fixed factor, there will come a point when each extra unit of the variable factor will produce less extra output (marginal product MP) than the previous unit. In other words it means that the increase in total output will become progressively smaller as more units of the variable factor are applied to the same quantity of fixed factors. Total product (TP) represents the output of a product obtained from a given mix of resources per period of time. In order to explain the law let's assume that the fixed factor is land and the variable factor is labour and the firm increases its number of workers on the same amount of land. We can analyze the results on the following sequence of three different graphs.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/154c188f894bde77ac5c7138bdce1c58" alt="" width="306" height="632"><br><br>It can be noted that the TP rises at a lower rate beyond point 'a'. It signifies a decrease in MP because the slope between two successive points becomes flatter. So point 'a' is marked as the onset of diminishing returns. When we trace the same point on the graph below we find that beyond this point MP declines and when MP falls to zero TP is maximized. On its way down MP intersects AP at point 'b' that is marked as the highest value of AP. We can trace this point on the TP curve as indicating by the highest slope on a point from the origin. So we obtain this typical pattern of MP curve that initially shows a rise in MP and then beyond a certain point when diminishing returns sets in, it starts to fall.<br>But what is more significant to note is the pattern of marginal cost (MC) curve that is directly linked to MP and hence diminishing returns. MC is defined as the extra cost incurred for the production of an additional unit of a good and it is linked to the cost incurred on variable factor. Initially as more of the workers are employed, extra units of output cost less than the previous units indicated by a fall in the MC curve. This corresponds to the rising portion of MP curve that leads to a fall in average variable cost. Beyond a certain point, however, diminishing returns takes effect and causes MP to decrease and hence MC to rise.<br>Thus it can be concluded that the shape of the MC curve follows directly from the law of diminishing returns.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 63</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9375</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Consumers decide what they wish to buy and as a result direct the market.

This usually occurs in a perfectly free market. Consumer spending is comparable to votes in an election. The businesses which receive the most votes will be able to purchase the factors of production needed to produce the goods demanded by consumers. Therefore the firms receiving no votes will go out of business.</p>
<p>Total consumer sovereignty only exists if there is perfect knowledge or perfect information in the market place. If consumers are to allocate their resources in a way that maximise their utility, they need to know about the products they are buying. In many cases, consumers are well placed to make consumption decisions. A consumer, for instance, is likely to be the best judge of whether to buy bananas or apples.</p>
<p>So far as the theory of firms is concerned, consumer are said to be sovereign in a perfectly competitive market. Perfect competition is characterized by large number of relatively small firms producing homogeneous products in the absence of entry exit barriers. Price in such conditions is determined by total demand and supply forces in the market and each individual firm produces just a fraction of total output, therefore, a change in output by an individual firm does not affect the total market supply and hence the market price. Thus all the firms are price takers and each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve.</p>
<p>So, due to the highest degree of competition among firms, it is the collective decisions of consumers that decide what is produced, the quality, the distribution and the price charged. Firms producing products against the wishes of consumer would find it hard to survive. The consumer gains from the low price, since not only are costs kept low, but also there are no long run supernormal profits to add to cost. The consumers also enjoy allocative efficiency as not only they consume the products that they demand for but consume them up to the desired level. The consumer surplus is also maximised in that the consumers pay the lowest price possible for all quantities bought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are markets where consumers' dominance does not exist and they have to surrender their sovereignty to producers mainly due to the lack of sufficient competition. In a monopoly market situation the consumer would not be 'king'. This is because the producer, due to his better bargaining position, would decide on what to be produced, how to be produced, how much and for whom to be produced. The monopolist can raise its price and consumers have no alternative firm to turn to within the industry. They either pay a higher price or go without the good altogether. Unlike perfect competition, where consumers' preferences are given the highest weightage, it is monopolist who decides the price, and as he reduces the quantity, he raises the price. Thus consumer surplus is reduced. Also, monopolist, due to lack of competition, has little incentive to improve on his products or efficiency. All these weaken consumer sovereignty and therefore, undermine consumer's welfare.</p>
<p>In many imperfect markets, like those for cars, television sets or computers, consumers make infrequent purchases. If they buy, and find for whatever reason that they don't like the product, then it is very expensive to make a fresh choice. When they come to replace an item the product range may have changed completely. This is different from markets like food where consumers are making frequent purchases. In the food market, consumers can experiment at little cost and find the products they prefer. So in general, the less frequent the purchase, the less likely it is that consumers will have considerable influence on market decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on many occasions consumers may not be capable of making rational choices because of the technical nature of the product. For instance, consumers for the most part are unable to tell which make of freezer has the best insulation, which television set has the most durable components. Thus, markets in such industries are more likely to be dominated by producers because consumers ultimately have to rely on information provided by the sellers. <br>In conclusion, consumers' control is expected to exist in markets that are charged with competition and also where information is perfect such as perfect competition. However, consumer sovereignty is weakened when the degree of competition in a market is low or the market does not provide complete information to the consumers. Thus the balance between producer and consumer dominance may vary from one type of market to another.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 64</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9374</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Consumers decide what they wish to buy and as a result direct the market.

He is said to act rationally if he weighs up costs and benefits of each additional unit of a good he purchases. We can use marginal utility analysis to show how a rational person decides what combination of goods to buy.</p>
<p>Utility is the satisfaction that people derive from the consumption of goods and services. Total utility (TU) and Marginal utility (MU) are two important measures of utility. Total utility (TU) is the total satisfaction a consumer obtains from the consumption of all the units of a good consumed, while marginal utility (MU) is the satisfaction gained from consuming one extra unit of a good within a given time period. MU is measured as: TU<sub>n</sub> - TU<sub>n-1</sub> = MU.</p>
<p>According to the principle of diminishing marginal utility, as more units of a good are consumed successively, each extra unit will provide less additional satisfaction than previous unit. For example, the second bar of chocolate gives us less additional satisfaction than the first bar. The third bar gives even less satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now we extend our analysis of utility to explain how a rational consumer decides what combination of goods to buy from the given income. The underlying principle is called equimarginal utility. The law states that the individual consumer is in equilibrium when it is not possible to obtain an increase in total utility by switching expenditure from one product to another. This occurs when:</p>
<p>MU<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b&nbsp;</sub>= ...... = MU<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>Where a,b,, ..... n are the various goods consumed.</p>
<p>The above equation states that the consumer is in equilibrium when the marginal utility from the last money unit spent on each product yields the same satisfaction. So the consumer equilibrium is important for it is where the consumer has allocated his or her income in such a way that the maximum utility has been achieved. If the consumer is not in disequilibrium then he would continue switching his expenditure in favour of a good that gives him better value of his money until he obtains the same utility from the last money unit spent on each good.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate this principle we assume that satisfaction can be measured in utils. A util is an imaginary unit of satisfaction from the consumption of a good. Consumer is rational, and therefore wants to maximize satisfaction also his taste and preferences are constant. Consumer has a fixed income, and he will be spending on two normal goods X and Y. Let's also assume that good X costs twice as much as good Y but it gives three times as much satisfaction as good Y. When we apply this to the formula we obtain the following result:</p>
<p>MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y&nbsp;</sub>= 3/1 and P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y&nbsp;</sub>= 2/1</p>
<p>So with the current purchase the consumer finds that</p>
<p>MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y&nbsp;</sub>&gt; P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y</sub></p>
<p>ln the current situation the consumer is not maximizing satisfaction and in order to achieve maximum satisfaction the consumer must increase his purchase of good X relative to that of good Y. But as he buys more of good X, according to the law of diminishing marginal utility, the marginal utility of good X will fall. Simultaneously if reduces his purchase of good Y marginal utility of good Y will rise. The consumer should stop adjusting the balance of his purchases of goods X and Y when the marginal utility ratio is the same as the price ratio. In equation we can write it as:</p>

<p>At this point no further gain can be made by switching from one good to the other and therefore it suggests that the consumer's total utility is maximized for any given amount of income spent on these two goods. This can be applied to any number of goods the consumer intends to purchase. <br>So, the consumer theory predicts that a rational con-sumer decides to buy certain quantities of goods by following the principle of equimarginal utility.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 65</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9372</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Economic growth in China</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In less than 30 years, China has seen a huge shift from being a mainly farming economy to a thriving manufacturing economy. Since 2007, economic growth has continued despite uncertain economic conditions and the global financial crisis. Some economists doubt China's ability to sustain such economic growth, which has been achieved at a cost to the environment.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6868f078e1df3044eedfe6f48ea80839" alt="" width="766" height="676"><br><br>As China's economy continues to grow, it has a new challenge: how will it deal with the shift of the population from being mainly rural to being mainly urban? In 2030, it is estimated that about 220 cities in China will have at least one million residents. This will increase the pressure on natural resources. Economic inefficiencies created by urban growth include air and water pollution, traffic congestion, poor housing and overcrowding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">China's leaders have responded by reducing the target GDP growth rate. They have also concentrated on trying to improve the quality of China's economic growth and have focused on sustainable urban planning, low-carbon development, promoting improved public transit systems and improved water treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">National government policies can help correct market failures and set standards for environmental problems such as air pollution. They can establish partnerships between city authorities, businesses and the general public. Urban sustainability solutions do not just benefit the environment and people's quality of life; they are often highly profitable. Investment in rapid transit bus systems, for example, results in lower energy consumption and lower costs.</p>

<li>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the money value of total output produced by an economy using its resources locating within its boundaries over one year time period. The term 'real' suggests that inflation has been accounted for while the "growth rate" refers to the rate of increase in output over a period of time. Figure. 1 therefore shows the relative rate of increase in Chinese real output over twelve years time period.</li>
<li>Following uncertain economic conditions caused by the onset of financial crises in 2007, the Chinese growth rate dipped from over 11 % to 9%. It then continued to hover around 9% for the rest of five years. Up to this far it shows that Chinese economy has had some impact. It, however, could be argued that it still continued to grow at quite a high rate that remained above its targeted rate, therefore the extract supports the suggestion that China's growth 'has continued despite uncertain economic conditions'.</li>
<li>When economists use the term efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency. Failing to achieve either of the two or both, therefore, makes the economy inefficient. Allocative efficiency occurs when the consumers' valuation (P) of all products equals the cost of resources (marginal cost) used up in their production (P =MC). Inefficient allocation of resources, thus, occurs when P &gt; MC. The cases of overcrowding, poor housing and traffic congestion mentioned in the article indicate that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to create adequate space. If, however P &lt; MC then it suggests over allocation. The case of air or water pollution, for instance suggests that more resources have been allocated in production of goods causing pollution than what are required to maintain the level of pollution to a tolerable level. <br><br>Productive efficiency refers to the firms' costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. It occurs when producers minimize the wastage of resources by producing all the goods at the lowest possible per unit cost. Productive inefficiency, therefore exists, when firms produce at a relatively higher per unit cost.</li>
<li>Market failure occurs when the market forces of demand and supply result in an inefficient allocation of resources. Both air and water pollution and traffic congestion mentioned in the text are considered examples of negative externality that result from marginal social cost (MSC) to exceed the marginal social benefits (MSB). Thus they both indicate an excess of resources than what are required to achieve the socially optimum level (MSC = MSB). Governments around the world use various different measures in order to bring production to the socially optimum level. <br><br>A government, for instance, can introduce or increase indirect taxation on all those goods whose production and consumption are deemed higher than the socially optimum level. These taxes effectively result in a rise in cost of production or consumption; therefore, they can help to restrict supplies to the socially optimum level. In order to reduce traffic congestion the government, for instance, can charge these taxes directly in terms of road pricing. Use of taxes, however, may not be effective if demand for goods is price inelastic. Moreover, it is not always the best option when inflation rate is already too high or there is a wide income disparity in the economy. <br><br>As an alternative to taxation, government can regulate the level of output and pollution in a market by setting up a quota so that output is set at the socially optimum level. It is, however, hard to set an output quota without having accurate and reliable estimates for private benefits, costs and external environmental damage arising from production. Also compliance with environmental regulations can be costly to enforce and it may be impossible to monitor all firms accurately because of imperfect information. Some firms may not cut their emissions of pollutants if the fine they receive is less than the benefit they derive from polluting - fines must have some impact. In order to address traffic congestion government can introduce regulations such as restricting the entry of cars on busy roads carrying less than four commuters. This, however, should be accompanied with the&nbsp;provision of improved public transit systems so that people are encouraged to use them for their commuting needs.<br><br>Pollution often arises because property rights are not fully allocated therefore extending property. Nobody, for instance, owns the atmosphere or the oceans; therefore government can give water companies the right to charge those companies which dump waste into rivers or the sea. They can give local residents the right to claim compensation if pollution levels are more than a certain level. It is, however, difficult to estimate the accurate monetary value of pollution that is acceptable to all as it is based on individuals' valuation therefore it is subject to debate.<br><br>Many governments these days prefer a marketable permit that gives a business the right to emit a given quantity of waste or pollution into the environment. Once socially optimum level of pollution has been determined the permits are issued by auction and firms that pollute the environment can begin to buy and sell them amongst themselves. While the total level of pollution is not affected by these transactions, the cost of pollution control to society is reduced. Permits give firms an economic incentive to control pollution emissions for less than it would cost to buy permits.<br><br>It, therefore, follows that a government can adopt various measures in isolation or as a combination to overcome market failures such as pollution and road congestion.</li>

When economists use the term efficiency&nbsp;they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when&nbsp;right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce&nbsp;right products. In other words allocative efficiency&nbsp;occurs when the consumer valuation equals the cost of&nbsp;the resources (marginal cost) used up in production of&nbsp;a product. Thus the condition required for allocative&nbsp;efficiency is price = marginal cost. When this happens&nbsp;economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and&nbsp;producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates&nbsp;allocative efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8671eef298e06504ef8aef8e5b86d08c" alt="" width="332" height="249"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS,&nbsp;producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium&nbsp;in the market implies P = MC, hence, generating maximum&nbsp;possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus.&nbsp;Situations where either P &gt; MC or P &lt; MC imply&nbsp;inefficient allocation of resources as shownin the graph&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/924248ed5b43ad1d0eb164ae70a32295" alt="" width="330" height="223"></p>
<p>At output level of 100,000 units, P &gt; MC. It indicates&nbsp;that fewer resources have been allocated than what are&nbsp;required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC. Thus&nbsp;each additional unit up to 200,000 would increase both&nbsp;consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A,&nbsp;hence would improve allocative efficiency. On the other&nbsp;hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have&nbsp;been allocated for the production of this product. In the&nbsp;graph above the production of 300,000 units would&nbsp;represent an over allocation of resources. Hence the&nbsp;shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of&nbsp;consumer and producer surplus from the alternative&nbsp;product. Therefore net gains can be realized until production&nbsp;can be reduced to 200,000 units.</p>
<p>Hence resources are being efficiently allocated to any&nbsp;product when its output is such that its price equals&nbsp;marginal cost.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production&nbsp;and can be applied both to the short run and long&nbsp;run. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize&nbsp;the wastage of resources i.e when they produce a&nbsp;product using the least possible resources or generating&nbsp;the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/370158a8d81e2bceffad63ac474947c4" alt="" width="299" height="205"></p>
<p>AC<sub>3</sub> in the figure indicates productive efficiency. This&nbsp;means that the lowest possible cost techniques of production&nbsp;are being used to produce different level of&nbsp;output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per&nbsp;unit cost hence represent productive inefficiency. The&nbsp;firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when&nbsp;production occurs at the lowest point indicated by point&nbsp;z on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the&nbsp;term technical efficiency for this point. <br>Apart from other factors an improvement in efficient&nbsp;use of resources could result in economic growth. However&nbsp;growth can result in a wide ranging benefits and&nbsp;costs. It could also be the case that growth leads to&nbsp;productive efficiency because it is related to the total&nbsp;output. As a country achieves high growth rate its output&nbsp;level gets closer to PPC-the benchmark for productive&nbsp;efficiency. However it is difficult to hold that growth&nbsp;results in allocative efficiency. Firstly, because it is&nbsp;difficult to measure allocative efficiency and secondly,&nbsp;because more output does not necessarily imply that&nbsp;only those goods and services are produced that are&nbsp;most wanted by the society.</p>
<p>Thus the role of government is to intervene in markets&nbsp;that are not seen to be allocating resources in the most&nbsp;efficient manner. Government policy and methods of&nbsp;intervention can be summarized under four broad headings:&nbsp;regulation, financial intervention, direct provision&nbsp;and improving information. The method chosen will&nbsp;depend to a large extent on its effectiveness under the&nbsp;given circumstances.</p>
<p>So we conclude that achieving economic growth alone&nbsp;may lead to productive efficiency but it may or not&nbsp;result in an improved allocative efficiency Therefore the&nbsp;government has a role to play. It must use its policy&nbsp;tools to ensure that economic growth accompanies&nbsp;improvement in overall efficiency.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 67</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9369</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>How effective is the measurement of economic growth&nbsp;as an indicator of how a developing country's standard&nbsp;of living compares with other countries?</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The standard of living is a measure of the material welfare&nbsp;of the inhabitants of a country. The baseline measure of&nbsp;the standard of living is real GDP. This is the value of&nbsp;total output produced from all the resources located&nbsp;within the political borders of a country over one year&nbsp;time period. Growth in real GDP figures can be used&nbsp;to make cross-country comparisons. But this requires&nbsp;converting GDP data into a common currency. Besides&nbsp;this we need to make an adjustment to reflect differences&nbsp;in the average cost of goods and services in each&nbsp;country to produce data expressed at a 'purchasing&nbsp;power parity' standard and therefore need information&nbsp;on cost of living in countries. However, even after making&nbsp;these adjustments economists question the reliability of&nbsp;growth in real GDP as a means of comparing living&nbsp;slandered of a developing country with other countries.</p>
<p>In the first place it must be remembered that GDP on&nbsp;its own is both an inaccurate and insufficient indicator&nbsp;of true living standards both within and between countries.&nbsp;Therefore higher growth in real GDP does not&nbsp;necessarily imply that the citizens of a developing&nbsp;country enjoy higher living standard. Also, ignoring the&nbsp;changes in the size of population could give a wrong&nbsp;indication about the level of development. To counter&nbsp;this economists use real GDP per head to compare living&nbsp;standard between countries. Real GDP per head is&nbsp;calculated by dividing real GDP on the population of&nbsp;the country. It is a measure of how much of real goods&nbsp;and services is available to the average citizen for consumption&nbsp;and investment. It is believed that there should&nbsp;be a strong positive correlation between growth in RGDP&nbsp;per capita and economic well being; that is, greater&nbsp;production should move society toward" the good life". Therefore economists view levels and rates of growth&nbsp;of "real" per capita GDP, expressed in common currency,&nbsp;as a better indicator of compring economic well&nbsp;being internationally than GDP figures alone.</p>
<p>However it is widely held that even RGDP per head is&nbsp;of limited value for inter- country comparison of living&nbsp;standard. Firstly, income distributions between the countries&nbsp;may be different also national income accounts will&nbsp;have varying degrees of inaccuracy, caused, for instance,&nbsp;by different sizes of the informal economy in each&nbsp;country. The informal or black economy includes economic&nbsp;activity that goes unrecorded. The non-monetised&nbsp;sectors of the economy include output that is not sold&nbsp;at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed&nbsp;products. Economist's latest estimates for the&nbsp;total value of the black economy throughout the world&nbsp;are $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy&nbsp;is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich&nbsp;economies and 33% of national output for emerging&nbsp;economies. National income accounting conventions may&nbsp;also be different in different countries making it impossible&nbsp;to compare the two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also the problem of what rate of exchange to&nbsp;use when comparing one country's GDP with another.&nbsp;The day to day market exchange rate can bear little&nbsp;relation to relative prices in different countries. So prices&nbsp;in some countries, like Switzerland or West Germany,&nbsp;can be much higher at official exchange rates than in&nbsp;lndia or China. Therefore if national income statistics&nbsp;are to be used to compare living standards between&nbsp;countries it is important to use an exchange rate which&nbsp;compares the cost of living in each country. These&nbsp;exchange rates are known as purchasing power parities.&nbsp;For instance, if a typical basket of goods costs 10 Yuan&nbsp;in China and £ 1 in the UK, then national income should&nbsp;be converted at an exchange rate of 10 Yuan to the&nbsp;£ 1 - even if the market exchange rate gives a very different&nbsp;figure.</p>
<p>Even this is not accurate enough. In some countries,&nbsp;consumers have to purchase goods which in others are&nbsp;free. For instance, Sweden spends a greater proportion&nbsp;of its national income than India on fuel for heating&nbsp;because of its colder climate. But this extra expenditure&nbsp;does not give the Swedes a higher standard of living.&nbsp;Again, countries are different geographically and one&nbsp;country might have higher transport costs per unit of&nbsp;output than another because of congestion or having to&nbsp;transport goods long distances. In practice, it is almost&nbsp;impossible to adjust national income figures for these&nbsp;sorts of differences. <br>lt is believed that the numbers cannot capture our true&nbsp;overall well-being as a nation in comparison with other&nbsp;countries. Economists point out that many qualitative&nbsp;changes such as reduction of crime and violence, greater&nbsp;equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and&nbsp;reduction of drug and alcohol abuse could make a country&nbsp;better off than other countries without necessarily&nbsp;achieving higher growth in RGDP per head. At the same&nbsp;time, rising RGDP per head is usually accompanied by&nbsp;rising external cost, such as pollution, noise and accidents.&nbsp;These are not officially measured within national&nbsp;income but they do undermine the welfare and therefore&nbsp;distort comparison of living standard between nations.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 68</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9368</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the main aim of government policy&nbsp;should be to achieve a more equal distribution of&nbsp;income.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Traditionally, main macro economic aims of government&nbsp;policy can be seen as the achievement of full employment,&nbsp;price stability, economic growth and a balance of&nbsp;payments equilibrium. In addition to these governments&nbsp;also aim at achieving high degree of efficiency in the use&nbsp;of nation's scarce resources and a fairly acceptable level&nbsp;of distribution of income and wealth. Though not all&nbsp;governments will share these objectives, yet it is also&nbsp;true that there will be trade-offs and potential conflicts&nbsp;between the objectives, and different governments will&nbsp;attach differing priorities to them.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is important to keep unemployment levels as&nbsp;low as possible. High unemployment is expensive for&nbsp;the government and, therefore, for the taxpayer. For every&nbsp;unemployed person, there are two costs to the government.&nbsp;First, the unemployed workers will be entitled to&nbsp;benefit. Secondly, there is the less obvious cost of the&nbsp;loss of tax revenues, both from direct and indirect taxes,&nbsp;which the workers would have paid in work. Then there&nbsp;is the cost to the whole economy as unemployment&nbsp;involves a loss of potential output and hence lower living&nbsp;standard in general. Young unemployed workers may&nbsp;inflict other external costs on the society, crime for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>Secondly, control of inflation is important because if&nbsp;inflation gets out of control, the economy stops growing.&nbsp;The authorities are forced to raise interest rates to&nbsp;counter inflation. At higher interest rate consumers stop&nbsp;borrowing to spend and firms also reduce borrowing to&nbsp;invest. Exports become less competitive and the&nbsp;economy may well drop into a recession.</p>
<p>Thirdly, economic growth is a measure of rate of change&nbsp;of real GDP over a period of time. High rate of growth&nbsp;can be achieved by bringing unemployed resources at&nbsp;work or alternatively, by improving productivity of&nbsp;existing resources. Governments seek to achieve high&nbsp;but sustainable growth rate mainly because it leads to&nbsp;improved living standards and economic stability.</p>
<p>Fourthly, BOP is a summary of all economic transactions&nbsp;of a country with other nations over one year time&nbsp;period. A persistent BOP deficit initially results in a&nbsp;decline of a nation's foreign currency reserves and a run&nbsp;on its exchange rate. Ultimately, it necessitates borrowing&nbsp;and the country accumulates foreign debts, which&nbsp;have to be repaid with interest in future. The ideal&nbsp;situation represents a position where, at least over a&nbsp;number of years, the nation spends and invests abroad&nbsp;no more than other nations spend or invest in it.</p>
<p>In addition to these macro-economic objectives governments&nbsp;also aim to eliminate inefficiencies and inequitable&nbsp;distribution of income and wealth. For any government whether the current distribution of&nbsp;income is desirable or not is a normative issue. However,&nbsp;if the government in the office feels that some&nbsp;members of society have more money than they need,&nbsp;whereas other struggle to afford even basic necessities&nbsp;then there is an unfair income inequality. Government&nbsp;can adopt various measures, ranging from taxation to&nbsp;regulation and welfare benefits, in order to redistribute&nbsp;income from rich to poor. <br>It is mainly through taxes a government collects money&nbsp;that it needs to pay for its expenditures. A tax that&nbsp;raises the money by taking a larger percentage of income&nbsp;from the rich than the poor is called a progressive tax&nbsp;and it has the effect of reducing inequalities. Thus a&nbsp;government with the aim of achieving equity can tax the&nbsp;rich proportionately more than the poor in order to create&nbsp;vertical equity. At the same time it can enhance the&nbsp;personal tax allowances to ensure horizontal equity.&nbsp;However higher tax rates can create a disincentive effect&nbsp;and therefore can reduce the level of consumer spending&nbsp;and investment leading to a fall in growth rate and a rise&nbsp;in unemployment.</p>
<p>Practically, the objectives are determined by the political&nbsp;ends of the government. But in theory, at least, it&nbsp;depends on the current state of the economy. In times&nbsp;of recession, for instance, the priority objectives are&nbsp;growth and unemployment rather than more equal distribution&nbsp;of income. In times of high growth rate, however,&nbsp;government can adopt the policies to redistribute&nbsp;income and wealth.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 69</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9367</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Use liquidity preference theory to explain why there is&nbsp;a demand for money.</p>

In the Keynesian analysis of the rate&nbsp;of interest, demand for money is not based purely on&nbsp;the demand for new capital goods. In fact, Keynes argued&nbsp;that there are three distinct motives for preferring to&nbsp;hold wealth in the form of money as opposed to holding&nbsp;either non-money financial assets or physical assets.</p>
<p>Individuals need to hold money in order to meet daily&nbsp;transactions such as buying petrol, paying for groceries&nbsp;or purchasing a newspaper. Money balances held for&nbsp;this purpose is called transaction demand for money.&nbsp;Everyone will hold a certain amount of money since&nbsp;they are normally paid weekly or monthly whereas their&nbsp;expenditure is spread over the whole period. The average&nbsp;amount held for transactions purposes depends&nbsp;upon the level of money income, the price level, the&nbsp;time of the year and the frequency of pay days. In&nbsp;terms of money income, the higher the money income,&nbsp;the more likely the individual is to purchase more goods&nbsp;and services, and therefore require extra transactions balances.&nbsp;If the price level increases the demand for money&nbsp;for transactions purposes will be higher. In the case of&nbsp;the frequency of pay days, the more frequent, the lower&nbsp;the transactions demand for money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demand for money is also based on the desire to&nbsp;provide for the unexpected. The precautionary demand&nbsp;for money allows the individual to cover unforeseen&nbsp;events, such as the car breaking down, a lengthy period&nbsp;off work through illness, or an unexpected redundancy.&nbsp;It is likely to be the case that as the rate of interest&nbsp;increases, the precautionary demand for money will fall&nbsp;as individuals place their money in interest bearing&nbsp;assets, i.e. the cost of holding money has increased.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e2e11da0441bd09dee4ee658fd8f6a43" alt="" width="276" height="200"></p>
<p>Money balances held for these two purposes is called&nbsp;active balances (L<sub>1</sub>) i.e. money to be used as a medium&nbsp;of exchange.</p>
<p>Speculative demand for money is based on the expectation&nbsp;of making a speculative gain or avoiding a loss.&nbsp;Money balances held for this purpose are called idle&nbsp;balances (L<sub>2</sub>). Keynes outlined the speculative demand&nbsp;for money in terms of the desire to hold money or fixed&nbsp;income bonds. It is important to note that the price of&nbsp;bonds and the rate of interest are inversely related. When&nbsp;the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly high by&nbsp;individuals they will assume that the next move is in&nbsp;a downward direction. As stated, when the rate of interest&nbsp;falls the price of bonds increases and so there are capital&nbsp;gains to be made. This being so, when the rate of&nbsp;interest is high there will be a substantial demand for&nbsp;bonds and hence a low speculative demand to hold&nbsp;money. If, however, the rate of interest is perceived to&nbsp;be unduly low then individuals will assume that the&nbsp;next move is upwards, resulting in a fall in bond prices&nbsp;and, there-fore, a capital loss for those who own bonds.&nbsp;If this is the case, the demand for bonds is likely to be&nbsp;low and those owning bonds will be looking to sell&nbsp;them before the price falls. In this situation the speculative&nbsp;demand for money will be high as shown in the&nbsp;graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/582215df0068b9c9950bda1cfaf686ad" alt="" width="339" height="216"></p>
<p>The total demand for money LP is plotted against the&nbsp;rate of interest (r). This is found by the horizontal&nbsp;addition of curves L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/116c4918b1cae7d8d022eeeab6dba82b" alt="" width="350" height="222"></p>
<p>A change in interest rate causes movement along the&nbsp;demand for money curve upward or downward.</p>

Demand falls&nbsp;off, and, as a result, production and employment also&nbsp;fall. As employment falls, so do personal incomes. Profits&nbsp;drop, and some firms encounter financial difficulties.&nbsp;Business prospects are poor. Confidence is low therefore&nbsp;investment remains low. The effects on capital goods&nbsp;industry may thus be severe. Firms, finding their stocks&nbsp;of goods rising, cut back on production. Where cuts in&nbsp;production are very large then aggregate demand actually&nbsp;falls and there is a multiplied fall in national income.</p>
<p>Lower economic activities are expected to result in decline&nbsp;in both the government tax revenue and the level of&nbsp;imports. Therefore if the government attempts to maintain&nbsp;a balanced budget it either needs increase tax rates&nbsp;or cut its expenditure or both. These measures are&nbsp;considered to match its revenues. These are contractionary&nbsp;fiscal measures and according to Keynes are&nbsp;considered wrong in such time.</p>
<p>A contractionary or deflationary fiscal policy involves&nbsp;cutting government expenditure and/or increasing taxes&nbsp;this will have the effect of either reducing the budget&nbsp;deficit or increasing the budget surplus. It is where the&nbsp;government alters the balance between government&nbsp;expenditure (G) and taxation (t), and thereby alters the&nbsp;balance between injections and withdrawals. Faced with&nbsp;a slump, if government reduces its expenditure there&nbsp;will be a fall in the level of injections into the circular&nbsp;flow of NY. The following graph shows the effects of&nbsp;a cut in government expenditure.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c2594d1b0841ea8d89f260e5bb43118f" alt="" width="376" height="186"><br><br>Withdrawals equal injections at point 'e' therefore NY&nbsp;is in equilibrium at Y<sub>e</sub>. The fact that at Y <sub>F</sub> (full employment&nbsp;level of output) a deflationary gap exists and Y<sub>e&nbsp;</sub>is well below Y<sub>F</sub> suggests that the economy is in slump.&nbsp;Now if the government cuts its expenditure it initially&nbsp;leads to a fall in injections (J) as shown by a downward&nbsp;shift in J curve. This causes NY disequilibrium at Y<sub>e&nbsp;</sub>because W &gt; J. Also this fall in spending will only lead&nbsp;to firms cutting their output further and laying off more&nbsp;resources. Eventually NY falls many times more than&nbsp;the fall in injection due to the multiplier effect. Note&nbsp;that as NY falls withdrawals also decrease until W = J&nbsp;at Y<sub>1</sub> that becomes the new equilibrium level of NY.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The essence of the Keynesian model is that a country&nbsp;will come out of a slump with sufficient injections of&nbsp;demand into the economy. In that case the government&nbsp;should lower taxes in order to reduce the fall in disposable&nbsp;income. For unemployed, the government as part&nbsp;of welfare policy should give unemployment handouts.&nbsp;Both these measures at least help to keep aggregate&nbsp;demand from falling further. On the expenditure side,&nbsp;the government should maintain all public projects and&nbsp;obligations. The government may even embark on new&nbsp;public projects for the purpose of providing jobs in&nbsp;order to keep aggregate demand strong. Eventually a rise&nbsp;in injection of money will, through multiplier effect, lead&nbsp;to a multiple increase in national income. Prices will rise&nbsp;and employment will be increasing in order to meet the&nbsp;rising demand. Eventually the country will come out of&nbsp;slump.</p>
<p>From the above discussion it follows that increasing government&nbsp;expenditure rather than cutting them is the right&nbsp;policy to follow in slump.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 71</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9365</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Identify two government macroeconomic aims and&nbsp;analyse how a boom will bring beneficial changes for&nbsp;consumers and producers.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Traditionally, main macroeconomic aims of government&nbsp;policy can be seen as the achievement of full employment,&nbsp;price stability, economic growth and balance of&nbsp;payments equilibrium. Though not all governments will&nbsp;share these objectives, yet it is also true that there will&nbsp;be trade-offs and potential conflicts between the objectives,&nbsp;and different governments will attach differing&nbsp;priorities to them. An economic boom is the result of&nbsp;government pursuing the twin objectives of full employment&nbsp;and a high growth rate.</p>
<p>For today's governments it is important to keep unemployment&nbsp;levels as low as possible. High unemployment&nbsp;is expensive for the government and, therefore, for&nbsp;the taxpayer. For every unemployed person, there are&nbsp;two costs to the government. First, the unemployed&nbsp;workers will be entitled to benefit. Secondly, there is the&nbsp;less obvious cost of the loss of tax revenues, both from&nbsp;direct and indirect taxes, which the workers would have&nbsp;paid in work. Then there is the cost to the whole&nbsp;economy as unemployment involves a loss of potential&nbsp;output and hence lower living standard in general. Young&nbsp;unemployed workers may inflict other external costs on&nbsp;the society, crime for example.</p>
<p>Secondly governments aim to achieve high and sustained&nbsp;growth rate. Economic growth is a measure of rate of&nbsp;change of real GDP over a period of time. High rate of&nbsp;growth can be achieved by bringing unemployed resources&nbsp;at work or alternatively, by improving productivity of&nbsp;existing resources. Governments seek to achieve high&nbsp;but sustainable growth rate mainly because it leads to&nbsp;improved living standards and economic stability.</p>
<p>Economic boom is the result of widespread expansion&nbsp;of business activities in many sectors of the economy.&nbsp;Aggregate demand rises, and, as a result, production and&nbsp;employment also rise initially at a higher rate but as the&nbsp;economy approaches close to full employment they both&nbsp;slow down. High employment level results in increasing&nbsp;money incomes and growing spending. Firms, find their&nbsp;stocks of goods to decrease, so they try and increase&nbsp;their production. Increases in production in some sectors&nbsp;cause aggregate demand to actually rise further.&nbsp;Gradually bottlenecks appear in large part of the&nbsp;economy that increases firms' costs and eventually inflation&nbsp;rate accelerates.</p>
<p>As stated above producers face a situation of growing&nbsp;demand resulting in higher sales that initially increases&nbsp;their profits. So, they thrive on widespread optimism&nbsp;and make plans to expand their output further and&nbsp;therefore take the initiative to take up new investment&nbsp;plans. However subsequent relative shortages of inputs&nbsp;and their rising prices result in a rise in their costs of&nbsp;production. Whether firms can maintain their profits depends&nbsp;on how much of rising costs they can pass on&nbsp;to the consumers as higher prices. If, for instance, they&nbsp;pass on their rising costs partially to the consumers&nbsp;then it may reduce their profits. If, however, they pass&nbsp;on their rising costs entirely then they risk the levels of&nbsp;sales and hence profits.</p>
<p>Wide spread optimism and rising money incomes encourage&nbsp;consumer to buy more goods and services that&nbsp;ultimately results in improving their quality of life.&nbsp;However, as economy approaches close to full employment&nbsp;prices start to increase at an increasing rate and&nbsp;therefore curtail the purchasing power of consumers who&nbsp;then find that their money incomes cannot buy as much.&nbsp;Control of inflation then becomes the important goal of&nbsp;government because if inflation gets out of control, the&nbsp;economy stops growing. The authorities are forced to&nbsp;raise interest rates to counter inflation. At higher interest&nbsp;rate consumers stop borrowing to spend and firms&nbsp;also reduce borrowing to invest. Exports become less&nbsp;competitive and the economy may well drop into a&nbsp;recession.</p>
<p>So an economic boom brings both benefits and drawbacks&nbsp;for both consumers and producers.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 72</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9359</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>A huge company with a turnover of $99.3 billion paid its&nbsp;chief executive $10.9 million in 2011.

<li>Wages or the price of labour, like other prices, is determined&nbsp;by economic factors. However, social and political&nbsp;factors also play a part in wage determination, as&nbsp;labour is a unique factor, being the human factor.<br><br>The main factor which determines the level of wages in&nbsp;a particular occupation is the interaction of demand for&nbsp;labour and supply of labour involved in that occupation.&nbsp;If demand is high for a category of labour then it&nbsp;is likely that wages will rise and vice versa. If supply&nbsp;of a certain category of labour is limited then, again, it&nbsp;is likely that wages will rise and vice&nbsp;versa. If labour was a homogeneous&nbsp;factor and was sold in a perfectly competitive&nbsp;labour markets, every person&nbsp;would earn the income in equilibrium.&nbsp;Disequilibrium differentials in wages&nbsp;would arise, but workers move from&nbsp;lower income to higher income jobs&nbsp;until the differentials had disappeared.&nbsp;In the real world, however, some workers&nbsp;scrape out a bare living, others earn&nbsp;modest but adequate incomes, while yet&nbsp;others earn enough to afford many of&nbsp;life's luxuries.<br><br>If a unit of labour produces a certain&nbsp;physical amount of a good which sells&nbsp;at a particular price (marginal revenue&nbsp;product) then the employer cannot&nbsp;afford to pay the worker a wage greater than the MRP.&nbsp;The MRP (which is a derived demand) is obtained from&nbsp;the product of MPP of labour and price of the product.&nbsp;Hence an improvement in the productivity of labour&nbsp;would increase the demand for labour; likewise, an increase&nbsp;in the price of the product will increase the demand&nbsp;for labour. Thus the demand for labour is greatly affected&nbsp;by the value of its MRP. The higher the MRP&nbsp;of labour the greater the demand for labour and the higher&nbsp;will be wages going to labour.<br><br>Thus some wage differentials arise because basic human&nbsp;characteristics cause the supply of some types of labour&nbsp;to remain low relative to the demand for it, even in the&nbsp;long run. For instance, pop stars or footballers where&nbsp;relatively rare ability is required. Similarly if a job requires&nbsp;specific qualifications training then supply of&nbsp;labour will be reduced and wages higher. For instance,&nbsp;barristers and doctors need good qualifications and a&nbsp;long period training which limits the number of people&nbsp;who are able to do these job.&nbsp;<br><br>However a wide difference in wages between different&nbsp;occupations could also result from some other factors.&nbsp;If trade unions and professional bodies, for instance, can&nbsp;limit entry into certain occupations by apprenticeships&nbsp;and the need to pass exams then supply will be limited&nbsp;and wage higher. Thus industries with a strong trade&nbsp;union are likely to pay more than those with a weak&nbsp;trade union. <br><br>Likewise some forms of social factors such as discrimination&nbsp;makes it difficult, or impossible, for certain groups&nbsp;to take certain jobs, even if they are equipped by skill&nbsp;and education for these jobs. Thus due to the discriminatory&nbsp;practices the supply in certain occupations remains&nbsp;low and hence results in higher wages compared&nbsp;to the occupation not really affected by social discrimination.<br><br>Sometimes the supply of labour to a particular occupation&nbsp;may be limited because the job is dangerous or&nbsp;dirty. Such occupations may command higher wages, as&nbsp;for miners. Other jobs, such as teaching or the civil&nbsp;service have pleasant working conditions, job security&nbsp;and good pension schemes. Consequently, such jobs may&nbsp;earn lower wages. Similarly some jobs may have a great&nbsp;many perks and fringe benefits and the money wages&nbsp;may be lower because of these advantage.&nbsp;<br><br>Many wage inequalities result from several types of&nbsp;market imperfections which impede workers from&nbsp;moving from their current jobs to take higher-paying&nbsp;jobs. For instance workers may simply not be aware of&nbsp;job opportunities and wage rates in other geographic&nbsp;areas and in other jobs for which they qualify. Consequently,&nbsp;the flow of qualified labor from lower-paying&nbsp;to higher-paying jobs- and thus the adjustments in labor&nbsp;supply - may not be sufficient to equalize wages within&nbsp;occupations.&nbsp;<br><br>Thus we conclude that the economic analysis can explain&nbsp;a wide difference in the wage rate between occupations.</li>
<li>Although economic theory of wage determination assumes&nbsp;a perfectly competitive market, however, the&nbsp;theory could be extended to allow various real world&nbsp;market imperfections. There may be, for instance, a single&nbsp;buyer of labour - a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory&nbsp;is the main source of employment in a locality. If&nbsp;this is the case, then the wage rate (ACL) is no longer&nbsp;represented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the&nbsp;wage rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence,&nbsp;monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market&nbsp;supply curve and in order to recruit additional workers&nbsp;it has to offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the size&nbsp;of an employer's demand for labour will affect the wage&nbsp;rate. This is illustrated in the figure below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/3bb5ed5fc3cf19f3fe0f40f66f9da51a" alt="" width="365" height="228"><br><br>The higher MC<sub>L</sub> than AC<sub>L</sub> can be explained by the use&nbsp;of a simple example. At a wage rate of £100, 50 workers&nbsp;may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes&nbsp;to employ one more worker he is forced to offer £ 101&nbsp;the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost&nbsp;is now £ 101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising&nbsp;of £ 101 paid to the 51 st worker plus £ 1 paid to each&nbsp;of the 50 original workers.<br><br>Similar to the perfect market a monopsonist, being a&nbsp;profit maximiser, will employ where its MC<sub>L</sub> equals&nbsp;MRP<sub>L</sub>, indicated by point A in the graph, hence L<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>workers will be employed. The wage rate W<sub>1</sub>, however,&nbsp;is given by the S curve (AC<sub>L</sub>). In a perfectly competitive&nbsp;non-monopsony market the wage and numbers being&nbsp;employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. Thus&nbsp;monopsony power in a labour market will result in a&nbsp;lower level of employment and lower wages than would&nbsp;exist in a competitive labour market. Thus it is believed&nbsp;that imperfect markets leads to exploitation .<br><br>However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment&nbsp;can be corrected without government intervention&nbsp;simply by incorporating trade unions. A trade union&nbsp;could seek to resist the wage decrease of their members&nbsp;by either restricting the supply of labour or by direct&nbsp;negotiation. They can restrict the supply of labour&nbsp;through the use of a closed shop or by lengthening the&nbsp;time it takes to complete an apprenticeship. Over a&nbsp;period of time this could reduce the supply of labour&nbsp;to an industry, shifting the supply curve from SL<sub>1</sub> to&nbsp;SL<sub>2</sub> shown in the figure below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d4953a7a147b1dd1fb116cb3da2ba58d" alt="" width="344" height="253"><br><br>The result would be an increase in the wage rate from&nbsp;W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>, but with a reduced number employed, i.e. L<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;instead of L<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br>Alternatively, trade unions can influence the market&nbsp;through collective bargaining. It involves the direct&nbsp;negotiation between a trade union, bargaining collectively&nbsp;on behalf of its members, and the employer(s). &nbsp;Suppose that the workers in an industry organize themselves&nbsp;under a single union so that the monopsonist&nbsp;employer now faces a monopoly union-a bilateral&nbsp;monopoly. In this case the two sides will settle the&nbsp;wage through collective bargaining. The outcome of&nbsp;bargaining depends on the objective and strength of each&nbsp;side. <br><br>When government intervenes in a labour market it fixes&nbsp;the minimum wage above the market wage rate. The&nbsp;minimum wage is a pay floor. Employers are not allowed&nbsp;to pay their employees a rate below the minimum&nbsp;wage. The outcome of minimum wage is illustrated&nbsp;on the following graph. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b388f619f67c56dfdf40bfe2d8afdec5" alt="" width="350" height="251"><br><br>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in&nbsp;the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and&nbsp;restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. The government then sets a&nbsp;minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, which will kink the supply curve&nbsp;of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal&nbsp;cost curve of labour. <br><br>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra&nbsp;workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour&nbsp;is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will&nbsp;employ L<sub>2</sub> workers.<br><br>Following a minimum wage fixed by the government,&nbsp;not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the&nbsp;monopsonist employer actually employs more workers.&nbsp;It is only when the minimum wage is fixed above W<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;that employment starts to fall.<br><br>Thus government intervention is not the only solution&nbsp;to deal with the exploitation of workers in an imperfectly&nbsp;competitive labour market. It can also be addressed&nbsp;by increasing the powers of trade unions so that they&nbsp;can bargain for a higher wage rate.</li>

Each firm&nbsp;is of a sufficiently large size that the decision taken by one&nbsp;firm will affect the decisions taken by the other firms in the&nbsp;market. The firms are, therefore, mutually dependent. On&nbsp;the other hand perfect competition describes the market&nbsp;structure where large number of relatively small firms produce&nbsp;homogeneous product that are perfect substitute. This&nbsp;leads to all firms being price takers with a perfectly elastic&nbsp;demand curve for their product. In addition to this there&nbsp;exists perfect freedom of entry and exit from the industry.</p>
<p>Both forms of markets are similar in a number of ways.&nbsp;Firstly, they both share the same objective of maximizing&nbsp;profit therefore they produce a level of output where their&nbsp;MC = MR. However the chances of earning abnormal profit&nbsp;are greater in oligopoly because of entry barriers. Firms in&nbsp;perfect competition earn only normal profit in the long run &nbsp;due to the ease of entry of new firms in the industry.</p>
<p>Secondly, firms in both markets face similar cost conditions.&nbsp;There is no difference in their cost structure and firms in&nbsp;both markets do take account of changes in their costs and&nbsp;revenues at varying prices. This is because a change in either&nbsp;cost or revenues has a bearing on the level of profit they&nbsp;earn.</p>
<p>However we can identify many differences in pricing and&nbsp;output policy between the two markets. Since the individual&nbsp;firm in a perfectly competitive market is powerless to change&nbsp;the price of its product, therefore, it maximizes profit by&nbsp;adjusting output to the point where its marginal revenue&nbsp;equals marginal cost. In such conditions profit may range&nbsp;from abnormal, normal and subnormal in the short run.&nbsp;However, due to the absence of entry exit barriers, profit is&nbsp;maintained at the normal level in the long run. The graph&nbsp;below illustrates this;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/89ea7c410aabdb365be4aa55bf33f768" alt="" width="450" height="186"></p>
<p>In the short run, the interaction between demand and supply&nbsp;determines the market-clearing price OP. This price is taken&nbsp;by each firm. The average revenue curve is their individual&nbsp;demand curve. Since the market price is constant for each&nbsp;unit sold, the AR curve also becomes the marginal revenue&nbsp;curve (MR) for a firm in perfect competition. For the firm,&nbsp;the profit maximising output is Oq where its MC = MR.&nbsp;This output generates a total revenue (OP x Oq) which is&nbsp;the same as total cost. In this situation the firm&nbsp;is said to earn normal profit because the AC incorporates the&nbsp;element of normal profit. It is the minimum level of profit&nbsp;required to keep factors of production in their current use.</p>
<p>Let's now assume that an increase in the market demand to&nbsp;D<sub>1</sub> raises the price to P<sub>1</sub>. The firm adjusts its output to q<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>because its MC = MR<sub>1</sub> at point e. In this case the firm is&nbsp;earning abnormal profit because its AR is greater than AC.&nbsp;If most firms are making abnormal profits in the short run,&nbsp;this encourages the entry of new firms into the industry.&nbsp;This will cause an outward shift in market supply forcing&nbsp;down the price. The increase in supply will eventually reduce&nbsp;the price until price = long run average cost. At this&nbsp;point, each firm in the industry is making normal profit.&nbsp;Other things remaining the same, there is no further incentive&nbsp;for movement of firms in and out of the industry and a longrun&nbsp;equilibrium has been established.</p>
<p>On the other hand oligopoly is an industry where there is&nbsp;a high level of market concentration. This implies that the&nbsp;number of firms is small enough for each firm to realize that&nbsp;its competitors may respond to anything that it does and&nbsp;that it should take such possible responses into account. Therefore, there is no single theory of how firms determine&nbsp;price and output under conditions of oligopoly.</p>
<p>In addition to this an oligopoly exhibits product branding,&nbsp;entry barriers, interdependent decision making and non-price&nbsp;competition. All of these features lead to different pricing&nbsp;and output decisions in oligopoly than a perfectly competitive&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>In deciding on pricing strategies, oligopolists face a basic&nbsp;dilemma between competition and cooperation. Unlike perfect&nbsp;competition there is a possibility of price competition.&nbsp;If a price war breaks out, oligopolists will produce and price&nbsp;much as a perfectly competitive industry. But price wars&nbsp;prove to be costly therefore they are short lived. Due to&nbsp;the threat of price wars and the existence of effective alternative&nbsp;strategies, oligopolists may engage in non-price competition.&nbsp;This can take a number of different forms such as&nbsp;product differentiation, where oligopolists can, through&nbsp;advertising, create a brand image for their product. The firm&nbsp;may offer a particular after-sales service or package the&nbsp;product in, a particular way.</p>
<p>However, there is much to be gained from cooperation in the&nbsp;form of collusion. Collusion is an agreement on price charged&nbsp;and level of output produced. Thus it makes it possible for&nbsp;oligopolists to act as a monopoly and to achieve maximum&nbsp;profits for the industry.</p>
<p>Pricing strategy in a non-collusive oligopoly is explained by&nbsp;the kinked demand curve. The kinked demand curve assumes&nbsp;that a business might face a dual demand curve for its product&nbsp;based on the likely reactions of other firms in the market&nbsp;to a change in its price. The common assumption of the&nbsp;theory is that firms in an oligopoly are looking to protect&nbsp;and maintain their market share and that rival firms are&nbsp;unlikely to match another's price increase but may match a&nbsp;price fall. The graph below illustrates this situation. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/82ed8dd463e796780c7abb7f7ec2297c" alt="" width="546" height="380"></p>
<p>lf a business raises price and others leave their prices constant,&nbsp;then we can expect quite a large substitution effect&nbsp;away from this firm making demand relatively price elastic.&nbsp;The business would then lose market share and expect to see&nbsp;a fall in its total revenue.</p>
<p>If a business reduces price but other firms follow suit, the&nbsp;relative price change is much smaller and demand would be&nbsp;inelastic in respect of the price change. Cutting prices when&nbsp;demand is inelastic also leads to a fall in total revenue with&nbsp;little or no effect on market share. The kinked demand curve&nbsp;model therefore makes a prediction that a business might&nbsp;reach a stable profit-maximising equilibrium at price P<sub>1</sub> and&nbsp;output Q<sub>1</sub> and have little incentive to alter prices.</p>
<p>So, the two markets are similar in terms of their objectives&nbsp;and calculation of their costs, revenues and profit. However&nbsp;they adopt different pricing and output policies in order to&nbsp;maximise profit due to the different market conditions.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 74</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9341</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Integration and market supply</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Article 1. Cisco is a telecommunications company that profited from the rapid growth of the Internet in&nbsp;the 1990s by producing a wide range of equipment that became vital for companies providing internet&nbsp;services. It is now a world leader in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2012 Cisco announced its intention to acquire Lightwire Inc. another telecommunications company. Cisco&nbsp;said that the acquisition would result in the integration of two comparable businesses. It would allow it to&nbsp;meet customers' demands for smaller and more powerful equipment and at the same time customers' capital&nbsp;and operating costs could be reduced. Cisco said Lightwire's employees would become Cisco employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Article 2. In Australia two big supermarket chains control up to 80% of grocery sales. They wish to increase&nbsp;the percentage of products carrying their own supermarket label (own-brand) from the current 20% of stock&nbsp;to over 40%. Analysts say this aim implies that supermarkets will engage in integration by taking over their&nbsp;suppliers and they are concerned about the effect on the 225000 workers who manufacture alternative brands.&nbsp;They are also concerned about the effects it will have on consumers, competition and on Australia's capabilities&nbsp;as a food exporting nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many manufacturers rely on the two dominant supermarkets as a means of getting their products to consumers.&nbsp;The supermarkets have adopted an aggressive attitude towards the manufacturers, for example, by&nbsp;forcing them to accept lower profits for their products. It is argued that stronger supervision by Australia's&nbsp;Competition and Consumer Commission is required to monitor the supermarkets to ensure fairness and&nbsp;prevent a misuse of market power.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some manufacturers, as well as making their own products, also supply the supermarket with its ownbrand&nbsp;products which are usually cheaper for the consumer. This provides both volume and certainty of sales for&nbsp;the manufacturer in the short run. However, it means that the manufacturer is effectively competing with&nbsp;itself, risking its long-term competitiveness and cutting its own long-term profit margins. This is because the&nbsp;supermarkets are less likely to stock the manufacturers' brands once their ownbrand is established.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Analysts draw attention to the possible serious results of this for research and innovation. With reduced&nbsp;long-term profitability, Australian manufacturers would not invest in research.

<li>"Two comparable businesses" suggests same stage and same production process, therefore, in case of Cisco&nbsp;horizontal integration occurs. "Taking over suppliers" indicates different stages of the same production&nbsp;process thus backward vertical integration.</li>
<li>Cisco, stated that employees would be integrated into Cisco, so employment would be more stable in the&nbsp;short run but it is unlikely that a merger would take place without some rationalisation of resources by&nbsp;the company. Therefore in the long run duplication of resources could lead Cisco to rationalize and lay&nbsp;off workers. In case of supermarkets employment in other manufacturing firms could decrease in the long&nbsp;term although it might be safeguarded in the short term. However, if the supermarket makes its own&nbsp;products there may be an increase in employment for the supermarket. So, overall result is uncertain.</li>
<li>A business must earn substantial profits to spend money on research and development that allows it to&nbsp;invent and innovate products and production process. It, therefore, allows the firms to add more values&nbsp;to their products. The article highlights this and then goes on to draw a conclusion that without research&nbsp;there will be a decline in production for which no proper reason has been provided. However, if we accept&nbsp;this notion then a decline in production is likely to risk Australia's food security because it will depend&nbsp;for food on other countries. The conclusion can be supported by the argument that Australia failing to&nbsp;innovate while its competitors move ahead with research and innovation may erode Australia's comparative&nbsp;advantage in food production.</li>
<li>In case of supermarkets vertical backward integration will ensure that they get the supplies of the right&nbsp;quality, at the right time and place and in the right quantity. Thus it will eliminate uncertainty and increase&nbsp;their sales and profits, therefore, supermarkets benefit. Producers who supply their goods to supermarket&nbsp;possibly benefits from increased orders at least in the short term. In the long run, however, supermarket&nbsp;may decide not to buy manufacturers' brands or reduce their stocks of manufacturers' brands once their&nbsp;own brand is established.<br><br>Consumers may gain in the short term because increasing economies of scale resulting from integration&nbsp;could lead to lower prices. In the long run, however, supermarket could misuse its market power; therefore,&nbsp;consumers may have a narrow choice or they may end up paying a higher price and be forced to accept&nbsp;lower quality. So supermarket benefits from vertical integration but manufacturers and consumers face&nbsp;uncertain conditions in the long run.<br>In case of Cisco's horizontal integration the firm is likely to benefit from possibly lower costs due to&nbsp;economies of scale and increased sales and higher profits. The firm will also benefit in terms of reducing&nbsp;competition through integration with a rival firm. Also, it will have an increasing dominance in the market&nbsp;that the firm may use to increase its profits. Furthermore, higher profits will enable the firm to allocate&nbsp;more resources for research and development that will improve its competitive ability with other rival&nbsp;firms.<br><br>Consumers will benefit due to the reduced cost leading to lower prices. Also research oriented towards&nbsp;innovation will lead the consumers to benefit from improving quality of the goods. So, horizontal integration&nbsp;is likely to benefit both the firm and its buyers.</li>

While developing countries are mainly characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technological dependence on developed economies.<br>In developing countries, there is vast open unemployment and disguised unemployment. Generally unemployment spreads with urbanization and the spread of education because the manufacturing sector fails to expand along with the growth of labour force. There is unemployment among the educated who fail to find jobs due to the lack of manpower planning. Then there is concealed or disguised unemployment. This is when the workers are unable to find work&nbsp;throughout the year. Generally persistent high unemployment in developing countries is attributed to undeveloped natural resources, lack of capital formation, technological backwardness and lack of enterprise and initiative. So, high unemployment in developing countries persists in the long&nbsp;run because they continue to operate below capacity.</p>
<p>The issue of high unemployment in developed countries, particularly in recent years, is as much a problem as for developing countries but the phenomenon of unemployment is more of cyclical nature as opposed to structural nature in developing countries. Cyclical unemployment is involuntary unemployment due to a lack of aggregate demand for goods and services. This is also known as Keynesian "demand deficient" unemployment and is associated with the transition of the economy through the business cycle. When there is an economic recession we expect to see a rising level of unemployment because of plant closures and worker layoffs. This is due to a fall in demand leading to a contraction in output across many industries. However when the&nbsp;economy recovers from recession AD rises and unemployment falls.</p>
<p>Thus prevalence of high unemployment does not necessarily indicate that the country can be classified as developing.</p>
<p>In order to assess the level of development, we must have a means of measuring the value of the nation's output. The measure that economists widely use for this purpose is called GDP. We define GDP as the monetary value of total output produced within the country over a twelve month period.</p>
<p>GDP is used to compare performance of an economy compared&nbsp;to other countries. Also GDP is used to calculate the rate of economic growth. Most common usage of GDP is to determine the levels of development of different economies. However, if we are to make sensible use of GDP figures, we must take inflation and size of population into account. Increasing price level, for instance, may increase the GDP figure more than the increase in output. While ignoring the changes in the size of population could give a wrong indication about the level of development.</p>
<p>However, even after making these adjustments economists&nbsp;question the reliability of GDP as an economic indicator of development for various reasons.<br>Firstly, national GDP figures hide significant regional variations in output, employment and incomes per head of population. Within each region there are also areas of relative prosperity contrasting with unemployment black-spots and deep-rooted social and economic deprivation. Also, GDP figures on their own do not show the distribution of income and the uneven spread of financial wealth. Incomes and earnings may be highly unequally distributed among the population and rising national prosperity can still be accompanied&nbsp;by rising relative poverty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, higher GDP might have been accompanied by an increase in pollution and other negative externalities which have a negative effect on economic welfare. Output figures also tell us little about the quality of goods and services produced. Also, rising national output might have been achieved at the expense of leisure time if workers are working longer hours.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need to analyse the balance between consumption and investment. If an economy devotes too many resources to satisfying the short run needs &amp; wants of consumers, there may be insufficient resources for investment needed for long-term economic development. Faster economic growth might improve living standards today but lead to an over-exploitation of scarce finite economic resources thereby&nbsp;limiting future growth prospects.</p>
<p>GDP figures might understate the level of development because of the existence and growth of black or informal economy. Black economy includes illegal and undeclared transactions while informal sector is the non monetised part of the economy, it includes output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed products. The Economist's latest estimate for the total value of the black economy throughout the world is $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. According to their survey, Nigeria and Thailand have the world's largest black economies, both accounting for more than 70% of official GDP.</p>
<p>Lastly, GDP figures are calculated from millions of different returns to the government. Inevitably mistakes are made and returns are inaccurate or simply not completed. Therefore the figures are not exact and accurate and do not provide a&nbsp;precise and accurate account of economic activities.</p>
<p>It is believed that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being of a nation. Economists point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off without necessarily achieving higher GDP, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Compared to GDP figures the Measure of economic welfare (MEW) is reflects the state of development more accurately. MEW is one of the alternative measures developed to overcome the problems of using GDP as an indicator of development. This starts with GNP and NNP. To this was added an allowance for leisure, for various non-marketed goods and services such as housework and underground activities, for the services of various public amenities such as parks and roads, and for private durable goods such as furniture and jewellary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various items were subtracted. These included regrettables' such as expenditure on defence and commuting to work, and various 'bads' such as pollution. Also various intermediate items such as the benefits of education were subtracted.</p>
<p>The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies around the world.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that high unemployment and low level of GDP alone do not indicate that a country is developing. Instead we need to combine many other qualitative attributes to classify a country as a developing country.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 76</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9315</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>While the overall aim may be to improve the economy,&nbsp;governments find that their macroeconomic policies sometimes&nbsp;conflict with each other.

In addition to these governments also aim at&nbsp;achieving high degree of efficiency in the use of nation's&nbsp;scarce resources and a fairly acceptable level of distribution&nbsp;of income and wealth. Though not all governments will share&nbsp;these objectives, yet it is also true that there will be tradeoffs&nbsp;and potential conflicts between the objectives, and different&nbsp;governments will attach differing priorities to them.</p>
<p>For governments around the world it is important to keep&nbsp;unemployment levels as low as possible. High unemployment&nbsp;is expensive for the government and, therefore, for the&nbsp;taxpayer. For every unemployed person, there are two costs&nbsp;to the government. First, the unemployed workers will be&nbsp;entitled to benefit. Secondly, there is the less obvious cost&nbsp;of the loss of tax revenues, both from direct and indirect&nbsp;taxes, which the workers would have paid in work. Then&nbsp;there is the cost to the whole economy as unemployment&nbsp;involves a loss of potential output and hence lower living&nbsp;standard in general. Young unemployed workers may inflict&nbsp;other external costs on the society, crime for example.</p>
<p>Control of inflation is also important because if inflation gets&nbsp;out of control, the economy stops growing. The authorities&nbsp;are forced to raise interest rates to counter inflation. At higher&nbsp;interest rate consumers stop borrowing to spend and firms&nbsp;also reduce borrowing to invest. Exports become less competitive&nbsp;and the economy may well drop into a recession.&nbsp;Also periods of high inflation cause redistribution of income&nbsp;from savers to borrowers. Economists do not like this income&nbsp;distortion because it discourages savings as, over the&nbsp;longer term, the amount of investment in an economy is&nbsp;closely related to the amount of saving.<br>High and sustained level of economic growth rate is always&nbsp;given priority by all governments. Economic growth is a&nbsp;measure of rate of change of real GDP over a period of time.&nbsp;High rate of growth can be achieved by bringing unemployed&nbsp;resources at work or alternatively, by improving productivity&nbsp;of existing resources. Governments seek to achieve high&nbsp;but sustainable growth rate mainly because it leads to improved&nbsp;living standards and economic stability.</p>
<p>Apart from growth, employment and price stability a satisfactory&nbsp;balance of payment (BOP) position is essential to&nbsp;maintain macroeconomic balance. BOP is a summary of all&nbsp;economic transactions of a country with other nations over&nbsp;one year time period. BOP consists of all transactions relating&nbsp;to the exchange of visible goods such as various consumer&nbsp;and manufacturing items. exchange of invisibles and&nbsp;investment earnings such as services, profit and interest&nbsp;payments. It also records money inflows in terms of borrowing&nbsp;and foreign investment and money outflows as lending&nbsp;and investment abroad. A persistent BOP deficit initially&nbsp;results in a decline of a nation's foreign currency reserves&nbsp;and a run on its exchange rate. Ultimately, it necessitates&nbsp;borrowing and the country accumulates foreign debts which&nbsp;have to be repaid with interest in future. The ideal situation&nbsp;represents a position where, at least over a number of years,&nbsp;the nation spends and invests abroad no more than other&nbsp;nations spend or invest in it.</p>
<p>Left to market forces, owners of inputs, who are paid for&nbsp;their services, will receive significantly larger share of the&nbsp;cake of national income and better life chances than their&nbsp;retired, unemployed, disabled and underprivileged counterparts.&nbsp;Governments seek to redistribute income through&nbsp;progressive taxation and various transfer payments.</p>
<p>Any situation in which the unrestrained market system causes&nbsp;too few or too many resources to be allocated to a specific&nbsp;economic activity can be stated as an example of inefficiency&nbsp;such as, spillover effects (externalities) of many economic&nbsp;activities or market forces unable to provide public goods.&nbsp;Governments seek to eliminate inefficiencies to maximize&nbsp;output from scarce resources.</p>
<p>The nature of these policy objectives is such that they conflict&nbsp;with each other. There exist potential conflicts not only in&nbsp;macroeconomic objectives but also between macro and micro&nbsp;economic objectives. There are, therefore, possible trade-offs&nbsp;between the key policy objectives and it is rare for any&nbsp;government to be able to meet all its objectives at the same&nbsp;time. The complexity of the economy and the limitations of&nbsp;economic policies make this a really tough task! Therefore&nbsp;the government of the present day has to choose from these&nbsp;objectives and try to achieve them on priority basis. The&nbsp;order of priority depends on the current economic situation&nbsp;and the political ends of the government in office.</p>
<p>Governments are thus faced with a dilemma. If they reflate&nbsp;the economy, they will make two of the objectives better&nbsp;(growth and unemployment), but the other two worse (inflation&nbsp;and the current account of the balance of payments).&nbsp;If they deflate the economy, it is the other way round: inflation&nbsp;and the current account of the balance of payments will&nbsp;improve, but unemployment will rise and growth or output&nbsp;will fall. This complexity further rises when growth and&nbsp;employment result in higher negative externalities, concentration&nbsp;of market power or possibly widening gap between rich&nbsp;and poor.</p>
<p>Sustained growth caused by rising aggregate demand, for&nbsp;instance, can lead to acceleration in inflation as the economy&nbsp;uses up scarce resources and short run aggregate supply&nbsp;becomes inelastic. When SRAS is elastic, an outward shift&nbsp;of aggregate demand can easily be met by a rise in real GDP&nbsp;as there is plenty of spare capacity and supply responds&nbsp;elastically to the higher level of AD. But when SRAS becomes&nbsp;inelastic, the trade-off between growth and inflation&nbsp;worsens - an increase in AD tends to lead to higher prices&nbsp;rather than increased output and employment.</p>
<p>Similarly a potential conflict exists between economic growth&nbsp;and trade balance. When aggregate demand is high and domestic&nbsp;producers are unable to meet all of this demand, the&nbsp;demand for imported goods and services will increase leading&nbsp;to an increase in the trade deficit. This trade-off is evident&nbsp;when the main source of rising AD is a high level of consumer&nbsp;spending. This suggests that if the government wants&nbsp;to reduce the trade deficit, then it must accept that consumer&nbsp;demand (and GDP) must eventually grow at a slower rate&nbsp;in order to reduce the imbalance between exports and imports.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there always seems to be a trade-off between&nbsp;efficiency and equity in an economy. The most efficient&nbsp;economies in the world have grown the most and their inhabitants have experienced the best standards of living. But&nbsp;these economies tend to have the most unequal distributions&nbsp;of income. The competitive world of the free market creates&nbsp;winners and losers. The winners are exceptionally rich, but&nbsp;the losers can be worse off in absolute terms as well as&nbsp;relative terms unless the government's welfare state is generous.</p>
<p>Practically, the objectives are determined by the political ends&nbsp;of the government. But in theory, at least, it all depends on&nbsp;the current state of the economy. In a situation of an imbalance&nbsp;in macro or micro economic variables, a government is&nbsp;supposed to follow a balancing act in order to minimize the&nbsp;conflicting effects of these policy issues. In the phase of&nbsp;economic recession, for instance, a government usually focuses&nbsp;on achieving high growth rate and hence an increase in&nbsp;employment. Nevertheless, it requires a compromise on&nbsp;inflation, trade balance and equity. On the other hand, when&nbsp;a high inflationary growth results in worsening trade balance&nbsp;a government focuses on achieving price stability and corrections&nbsp;of trade balance that involves a sacrifice in growth rate&nbsp;and employment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the order of priority that these policy objectives&nbsp;are given depends on the current economic situation&nbsp;and the political ends of the government in office. But all&nbsp;governments in all nations ultimately desire these same&nbsp;objectives in their quest for economic stability.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 77</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9312</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the use of fiscal policy is the only&nbsp;effective means of stimulating economic growth.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Long term economic growth can be achieved either by&nbsp;increasing the supplies or improvement in productivity&nbsp;of factor inputs or both. While short term growth can&nbsp;be achieved by continuously increasing the level of aggregate&nbsp;demand (AD). AD is the sum of aggregate expenditure&nbsp;in an economy against various price levels i.e. AD&nbsp;= C + I + G + (X - M). Thus an increase in AD may&nbsp;result from a rise in either of its four components or all&nbsp;of them.</p>
<p>Government may focus on the demand side policies to&nbsp;achieve short term growth. In other words it may attempt&nbsp;to create sufficient AD to ensure that firms continue&nbsp;increasing their investments and that potential&nbsp;output is realized. This could be achieved by the use of&nbsp;reflationary fiscal or monetary policy or both.<br>Reflationary fiscal policy involves increasing the level of&nbsp;government expenditure or lowering the tax rates. This&nbsp;will raise people's disposable income and therefore encourage&nbsp;them to spend more. Also lower tax rates will&nbsp;encourage firms to increase investment. Either way the&nbsp;level of AD demand should rise or help encourage economic&nbsp;growth. The effectiveness of reflationary fiscal&nbsp;policy, however, depends on a number of factors. For&nbsp;example, the more reliable are the forecasts of what is&nbsp;likely to happen to aggregate demand, the more able will&nbsp;the government be to achieve growth. On the contrary,&nbsp;if changes in G or T are partly offset by changes in other&nbsp;injections and withdrawals fiscal policy may not succeed&nbsp;in increasing AD. Also the extent to which changes&nbsp;in aggregate demand will have the desired effects on&nbsp;output, employment, inflation and the balance of payments&nbsp;may not be precisely calculated.</p>
<p>Alternatively a reflationary monetary policy can be used&nbsp;to stimulate AD and hence growth. A reflationary monetary&nbsp;policy involves reducing interest rates and increasing&nbsp;money supply. These measures are expected to reflate&nbsp;the economy. This is because the lower interest rate will&nbsp;increase the demand for loans for consumption and&nbsp;investment leading to a rise in aggregate demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monetary policy, however, is especially weak when it&nbsp;is pulling against the expectations of firms and consumers.&nbsp;The main problem arises when demand side policies&nbsp;result in growing shortages leading to higher (demand pull)&nbsp;inflation and current account deficits.</p>
<p>For sustained and long term growth government may&nbsp;follow supply side policies. Supply-side economic policies&nbsp;are mainly micro-economic policies designed to&nbsp;improve the supply-side potential of an economy, make&nbsp;markets and industries operate more efficiently and&nbsp;thereby contribute to a faster rate of growth. <br>There are two broad approaches to the supply-side.&nbsp;Firstly policies focused on product markets where goods&nbsp;and services are produced and sold to consumers and&nbsp;secondly the labour market. Supply-side policies in&nbsp;product markets are designed to increase competition&nbsp;and efficiency. These policies include reforms such as&nbsp;privatization and deregulation and toughening up the&nbsp;environment for competition. They also include promotion&nbsp;of free international trade and creating incentives&nbsp;for enterprises of all sizes by providing a tax relief on&nbsp;research and development and reductions in the rate of&nbsp;corporation tax. The resulting capital spending by firms&nbsp;adds to aggregate demand ( C + I + G + (X - M)) but also&nbsp;has an important effect on long run aggregate supply.&nbsp;Furthermore new businesses entering the marketplace&nbsp;increase competitive pressures facilitating the introduction&nbsp;of new ideas and technologies.</p>
<p>Labour market reforms are designed to improve the&nbsp;quality and quantity of the supply of labour available&nbsp;to the economy. They seek to make the labour market&nbsp;more flexible so that it is better able to match the labour&nbsp;force to the demands placed upon it by employers in&nbsp;expanding sectors thereby reducing the risk of structural&nbsp;unemployment.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that the supply-side does&nbsp;not operate in isolation from changes in aggregate demand.&nbsp;If there is insufficient AD, it is unlikely that better&nbsp;supply-side performance can be achieved over a number&nbsp;of years. Equally, if aggregate demand grows too quickly,&nbsp;acceleration in wage and price inflation might require&nbsp;deflationary policies that ultimately harm a country's&nbsp;productive potential.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 78</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9311</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, using the concept of the multiplier, the possible link between a fall in interest rates and an increase in national income.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>In the money market the condition for monetary equilibrium&nbsp;is that the rate of interest will be such that&nbsp;everyone is just willing to hold the existing supply of&nbsp;money, i.e. interest rate does the job of equating the&nbsp;quantity of money demanded to the available supply&nbsp;and hence produces monetary equilibrium. In the figure&nbsp;below, we see how the interest rate produces monetary&nbsp;equilibrium.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/91aaaa37e0a6b14c37e544fa66160180" alt="" width="329" height="235"></p>
<p>Equilibrium is achieved with a rate of interest Re and&nbsp;the quantity of money Me. If the rate of interest were&nbsp;above Re, people would have money balances surplus&nbsp;to their needs. They would use these to buy securities&nbsp;and other assets. This would drive up the price of&nbsp;securities and drive down the rate of interest toward&nbsp;equilibrium. Similarly, if the rate of interest were below&nbsp;Re, people would have insufficient money balances. They&nbsp;would sell securities, thus lowering their prices and&nbsp;raising the rate of interest until it reached the equilibrium&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>Changes in money supply will affect national income&nbsp;via changes in the rate of interest. Let's assume that&nbsp;monetary authorities seek to adopt easy monetary&nbsp;measures and attempt to increase money supply, say,&nbsp;by lowering liquidity ratio of commercial banks or buying&nbsp;securities through open market operation.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/5b36814d2f87f80ecb13fcb6f25993db" alt="" width="396" height="259"></p>
<p>These measures shift the supply curve of money from&nbsp;MS to MS<sub>1</sub> as shown in the first part of the graph.&nbsp;Consequently, there is excess supply of money at the&nbsp;existing rate of interest Re. People still wish to hold&nbsp;only Me of money balances, but Me<sub>1</sub> is now available.&nbsp;In order to eliminate their excess holdings of money, people attempt to buy bonds and securities. This attempt&nbsp;of buying bonds and other financial assets increases&nbsp;their price and subsequently lowers the rate of&nbsp;interest. When interest has fallen to Re<sub>1</sub> the quantity of&nbsp;money demanded will have risen to equal the available&nbsp;supply of Me<sub>1</sub>. Monetary equilibrium is, thus re-established,&nbsp;though at a lower rate of interest.</p>
<p>The curve in the part 2 of the graph is called a marginal&nbsp;efficiency of investment curve (or just a demand for&nbsp;investment curve). MEC curve shows the relation between&nbsp;planned investment and the rate of interest, assuming&nbsp;all other things are equal. It is derived from&nbsp;prospective yield of one more unit of investment and&nbsp;the cost of obtaining it. Firms make their investment&nbsp;decisions by comparing MEC with the rate of interest.&nbsp;For instance, if the expected real net rate of return on&nbsp;an individual project (MEC) is greater than the real rate&nbsp;of interest, investment is profitable and hence is undertaken.&nbsp;Thus investment demand curve shows that the&nbsp;lower the rate of interest, the larger will be the number&nbsp;of investment opportunities that will show a profit and,&nbsp;hence, the larger the volume of investment expenditure&nbsp;that firms wish to undertake.</p>
<p>Note that, because both parts of the Figure above have&nbsp;the interest rate on the vertical axis, the interest rate can&nbsp;be compared between the two. Both parts show an&nbsp;initial equilibrium with the quantity of money of Me&nbsp;and an interest rate of Re. When the equilibrium is&nbsp;disturbed, say due to an increase in the money supply&nbsp;to Ms<sub>1</sub>, the rate of interest falls to Re<sub>1</sub>. Part (ii) of the&nbsp;Figure tells us that the fall in the interest rate from Re&nbsp;to Re<sub>1</sub> increases desired investment expenditure from I<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;to I<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>So far, we have seen that an increase in the money&nbsp;supply leads to a fall in the interest rate which, in turn,&nbsp;results in an increase in desired investment expenditure.&nbsp;We extend our analysis to finally figure out how these&nbsp;changes subsequently affect NY.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/93c560542477ff4c1e55f9b08018e569" alt="" width="420" height="250"></p>
<p>Equilibrium NY can be found by W = J. The withdrawals&nbsp;function is the vertical sum of the net saving, net&nbsp;taxes and import functions. Similarly, the injection function&nbsp;is the vertical addition of the investment, government expenditure and export functions. Initially, the&nbsp;equilibrium can be located at point a, indicating Y<sub>1</sub> as the&nbsp;equilibrium level of NY. A rise in investment expenditure&nbsp;shifts the J function upwards and will cause NY to&nbsp;increase (Y<sub>1</sub> - Y<sub>2</sub>) by more than the increase in investment. The number of times that the increase in income&nbsp;(NY) is greater than the increase in investment is known&nbsp;as the multiplier (k).</p>
<p>So an increase in injection into the economy will produce&nbsp;a stream of new incomes through additional spending&nbsp;that causes a multiplier effect. For example, if firms&nbsp;to invest more, this will lead to more people being&nbsp;employed and hence more incomes being paid to&nbsp;house-holds. Households will then spend part of this&nbsp;increased income on domestically produced goods (the&nbsp;remainder will be withdrawn). This increased consumption&nbsp;will encourage firms to produce more goods to meet&nbsp;the demand. Firms will thus employ more people and&nbsp;other factors of production. This leads to even more&nbsp;incomes being paid out to households. Consumption will&nbsp;thus increase yet again, and so the process continues&nbsp;until NY rises by full multiplier effect.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 79</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9308</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In the economic recession of 2011 many private sector firms&nbsp;were still able to announce that they were successful and had&nbsp;made substantial profits.

These&nbsp;choices involve allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses to achieve given ends. Resources are typically called factors of production. They include land, labour, capital and enterprise.</p>
<p>These are all inputs used in the production of all those goods and services that we want.</p>
<p>Private sector operates through market system that is associated with the capitalist ideology where all resources are privately owned. Hence economic decisions are made by individual households and firms who act in their own self interest. The essence of private sector is price mechanism, often quoted as "invisible hand". Operating on its own, without government intervention, price mechanism allocates resources through million of decisions taken each day by consumers and businesses. This system operates through signaling where a rise or fall in prices eliminates shortages and surpluses. This means that market prices will automatically adjust to where resources are required and where they are not required. Thus resources are allocated and reallocated according to the preferences of consumers and therefore consumers are said to be sovereign. So it is believed that apparently chaotic system of millions of transactions would&nbsp;not only allocate resources but it would do it efficiently.</p>
<p>Efficiency, on the other hand, generally relates to how well an economy uses its scarce resources to satisfy maximum wants of consumers. A market is said to achieve allocative efficiency when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. In other words allocative efficiency occurs when the consumer valuation (P) of a&nbsp;product equals the cost of resources (marginal cost) used up in its production. Thus the condition required for allocative&nbsp;efficiency is P = MC. When this happens economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6d84ed17c6c98547f601d30bfcbc3634" alt="" width="244" height="183"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS, producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium in the market implies P = MC, hence generating maximum possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8461d7a62d469d62458d82c33001119a" alt="" width="303" height="202"></p>
<p>At an output of 100 units P &gt; MC and, therefore, it indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC. So an increase in output up to 200 units would increase both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A and hence would improve allocative efficiency. On the other hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have been allocated for production. In the graph above the production of 300 units, for instance, suggests over allocation of resources. The shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of consumer and producer surplus from the alternative product. Therefore, net gains can be realized until production is reduced to 200 units. Thus it follows that the resources are efficiently allocated to produce a product when its output is such that its price equals marginal cost.</p>
<p>The theory of firm predicts that in a perfectly competitive market the demand curve of an individual firm becomes perfectly elastic therefore all firms become price takers. However, as the degree of competition is reduced, a perfect market, for instance, changes into imperfect market or monopoly, the demand curve for individual firms becomes steeper i.e. downward sloping from left to right. Firm's power to set price for its product is strengthened. Consider the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6585f67f3bd64fa7ed3b988ab462c690" alt="" width="321" height="252"></p>
<p>Assuming there are constant long-run marginal costs the sole seller will face the entire downward-sloping demand curve. The monopolist, therefore, produces at Q<sub>m</sub> and charges a price P<sub>m&nbsp;</sub>(MC = MR). Now we assume that the degree of competition improves and market becomes perfectly competitive also the costs stay the same then the equilibrium price will be P<sub>c</sub> and the equilibrium quantity supplied and demanded will be Q<sub>c</sub>. We see, then, that a monopolist charges a higher price and produces less than an industry in a competitive situation. Resources are inefficiency allocated in such a situation - too few resources are being used in the monopolist's industry and too many are used elsewhere.</p>
<p>We can extend our analysis further to point out difference in consumer surplus and dead weight loss. In figure above the area of consumer surplus is YTP<sub>c</sub> in the case of the perfectly competitive industry. While in a monopoly situation the area of consumer surplus shrinks to YSP<sub>m.</sub>&nbsp;The monopolist gains the area P<sub>c</sub> VS P<sub>m</sub> at the expense of consumers: this area adds to producer surplus and therefore labeled as abnormal profit earned by the monopolist. The triangular area STV is part of consumer surplus in a competitive market. But in monopoly neither consumers nor the monopolist obtain this as a surplus: it is lost to both parties. Because of this it is called the deadweight welfare loss arising from&nbsp;monopolies.</p>
<p>So in a private sector it is possible that private firms earn&nbsp;abnormal profit and therefore result in inefficient allocation&nbsp;of resources. However, it does not necessarily indicate that the private market system is not a suitable means of allocation. High profits could well generate further investment, income and employment.</p>
<p>In other cases market failure exists when even the competitive&nbsp;outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. The result is a loss of economic&nbsp;and social welfare generally known as social inefficiency. This&nbsp;is because the benefits that the free market confers on individuals&nbsp;or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge&nbsp;from the benefits to the society as a whole.</p>
<p>The existence of externalities, for instance, causes market&nbsp;forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level.&nbsp;An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers&nbsp;impose costs ·or confer benefits on others that are not&nbsp;involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem&nbsp;created by externalities is that market forces will lead to&nbsp;either too little or too much production. With a positive&nbsp;externality, a competitive free market will produce too little&nbsp;of the good and with a negative externality it produces too&nbsp;much of the good. Thus the presence of externalities, even&nbsp;when all markets are perfectly competitive, leads to socially&nbsp;inefficient outcomes.</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information.&nbsp;The reason for this is that party to a transaction&nbsp;can often take an advantage by shitting costs onto the other&nbsp;party, The other party loses because they do not have the&nbsp;same information. More generally, whenever either party to&nbsp;a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or&nbsp;is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces&nbsp;changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency. <br>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information.&nbsp;Consumers don't perceive quite well how good or&nbsp;bad a particular product is for them: either they do not have&nbsp;the right information or they simply lack some relevant&nbsp;information. The problem is that imperfect information causes&nbsp;market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of merit&nbsp;and demerit goods being produced or consumed.</p>
<p>A distinct type of market failure exists in case of public&nbsp;goods. The issue here is not over and under allocation but&nbsp;weather resources are allocated at all. A good must possess&nbsp;three distinguishing characteristics to qualify as public goods.&nbsp;It must be non-excludable, non-rival and non-rejectable. These&nbsp;features give rise to the free rider problem; people receiving&nbsp;benefits from a good without contributing to its cost. Thus&nbsp;it develops a situation in which everyone believes that others&nbsp;will take on the burden of paying for goods such as&nbsp;national defense and streetlights. Since the exclusion principle&nbsp;does not apply to these goods, private enterprises have&nbsp;no economic incentive to supply them. So we have goods&nbsp;which yield substantial benefits but to which the market&nbsp;system fails to allocate resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion it can be stated that private sector, though&nbsp;allocates resources efficiently in most cases yet it fails to&nbsp;achieve socially desirable outcome in certain situations known&nbsp;as market failures. Thus there is a justified economic role for&nbsp;government. However, government intervention in excess of&nbsp;market failure could restrict the efficient role of markets.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 80</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9300</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>Wage is the price paid for labour. ln a perfectly competitive&nbsp;labour market, so the economic theory goes,&nbsp;wage rate is determined by the market forces of demand&nbsp;and supply of labour. In such a market many firms&nbsp;compete with one another in hiring a specific type of&nbsp;labour. Moreover, there are numerous qualified workers&nbsp;with identical skills independently supply labour. There&nbsp;exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom&nbsp;of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual&nbsp;workers are wage takers.<br><br>The market demand for labor curve is found by summing&nbsp;horizontally the labor demand curves (MRPL curves)&nbsp;of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product&nbsp;(MRP<sub>L</sub>) is the increase in revenue that results from&nbsp;employing one more worker. MRPL is obtained by&nbsp;multiplying marginal physical product of labour (MPP<sub>L</sub>)&nbsp;and the firm's marginal revenue (MR). Thus MRP<sub>L</sub> =&nbsp;MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR. MPP<sub>L</sub> is the increase in total output when&nbsp;one more worker is employed and is subject to the law&nbsp;of diminishing returns while MR is determined by the&nbsp;price of the finished product. Therefore a firm, in the&nbsp;short-run, may experience production, revenue and profit&nbsp;as shown in the following table:<br><br>

<br>The MRP<sub>L</sub> rises and then declines due to the law of&nbsp;diminishing returns. The wage rate (W) is constant at&nbsp;$200 and this represents the marginal cost (MC<sub>L</sub>) and&nbsp;the average cost (AC<sub>L</sub>) of labour. The profit maximising&nbsp;position for the firm is where MRP<sub>L</sub> = MC<sub>L</sub> In the&nbsp;table this is where 6 workers are employed. The firm&nbsp;would not employ the 7th worker since he would only&nbsp;add $90 to revenue but would cost the firm $200 -&nbsp;hence reduces firm's profit by £ 110. Thus the firm hires&nbsp;six workers at the wage rate $200 and this gives us one&nbsp;point on the firm's demand curve. A change in the wage rate would require the firm to readjust its point of MRP<sub>L</sub>= MC<sub>L</sub> (equilibrium) hence generating more points on&nbsp;the demand curve.&nbsp;<br><br>On the supply side of labor market, we assume there&nbsp;is no union; workers compete individually for available&nbsp;jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes&nbsp;upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay&nbsp;higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so&nbsp;because firms must bid these workers away from other&nbsp;industries. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/eb268859608031c178b9f11a69cb5de2" alt="" width="468" height="189"><br><br>The graph sums up wage determination and equilibrium&nbsp;for a profit maximising firm facing a perfectly competitive&nbsp;labour market. The left panel shows that the wage&nbsp;rate is determined in the market by demand and supply&nbsp;forces and the firm is a wage taker. On the right panel&nbsp;the downward sloping portion of the firm's MRP<sub>L</sub> curve&nbsp;is its demand for labour. The firm faces a perfectly elastic&nbsp;supply curve of labour that also represents firm's MC<sub>L</sub>＆&nbsp;AC<sub>L</sub>. It implies that additional labour can be hired at&nbsp;the same wage rate, therefore W = MC<sub>L</sub> = AC<sub>L</sub>. So,&nbsp;according to the MRP theory the firm will find it profitable&nbsp;to hire ON workers where its MRP<sub>L</sub> equals MC<sub>L</sub>.&nbsp;The firm would not employ more than On workers&nbsp;because each additional worker would add less to the&nbsp;revenue than its costs thus leading to a fall in its profit.&nbsp;Similarly, On 1 workers employed indicates that the firm&nbsp;can increase its profit by employing more because each&nbsp;additional worker hired up to On would add&nbsp;more to the firm's revenue than its costs. <br><br>It, therefore, follows that a profit maximizing&nbsp;firm hires workers up to the point where MRP<sub>L</sub>= MC<sub>L</sub> and not necessarily where the MRP<sub>L</sub> is&nbsp;at its maximum.</li>
<li>Although economic theory of wage determination&nbsp;assumes a perfectly competitive market,&nbsp;however, the theory could be extended to allow&nbsp;various real world market imperfections. There&nbsp;may be, for instance, a single buyer of labour&nbsp;- a 'monopsonist' - where a large factory is&nbsp;the main source of employment in a locality. If&nbsp;this is the case, then the wage rate, (AC<sub>L</sub>) is no longer&nbsp;represented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the&nbsp;wage rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence,&nbsp;monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market&nbsp;supply curve and in order to recruit additional workers&nbsp;it has to offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the size&nbsp;of an employer's demand for labour will affect the wage&nbsp;rate. This is illustrated in the figure below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b7585439cf57b992d63c92049f0c8179" alt="" width="341" height="217"><br><br>The higher MC<sub>L</sub> than AC<sub>L</sub> can be explained by the use&nbsp;of a simple example. At a wage rate of £100, 50 workers&nbsp;may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes&nbsp;to employ one more worker he is forced to offer £ 101,&nbsp;the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost&nbsp;is now £101 but the marginal cost is £151, comprising&nbsp;of £101 paid to the 51st worker plus £1 paid to each&nbsp;of the 50 original workers. <br><br>Similar to the perfect market a monopsonist, being a&nbsp;profit maximiser, will employ where its MC<sub>L&nbsp;</sub>equals&nbsp;MRP<sub>L</sub>, indicated by point A in the graph, hence L<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;workers will be employed. The wage rate W<sub>1</sub>, however,&nbsp;is given by the S curve (AC<sub>L</sub>). In a perfectly competitive&nbsp;non-monopsony market the wage and numbers being&nbsp;employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. Thus&nbsp;monopsony power in a labour market will result in a&nbsp;lower level of employment and lower wages than would&nbsp;exist in a competitive labour market. However, this&nbsp;comparative lower wage rate and employment can be&nbsp;corrected by incorporating trade unions.<br><br>A trade union could seek to resist the wage decrease of&nbsp;their members by either restricting the supply of labour&nbsp;or by direct negotiation. They can restrict the supply&nbsp;of labour through the use of a closed shop or by lengthening&nbsp;the time it takes to complete an apprenticeship.&nbsp;Over a period of time this could reduce the supply of&nbsp;labour to an industry, shifting the supply curve from&nbsp;SL<sub>1</sub> to SL<sub>2</sub> shown in the figure below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/03175db36b9b7cfbf6303a9d837a3ccc" alt="" width="303" height="230"> <br><br>The result would be an increase in the wage rate from&nbsp;W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>, but with a reduced number employed, i.e. L<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;instead of L<sub>1</sub>.<br>Alternatively, trade unions can influence the market&nbsp;through collective bargaining. It involves the direct&nbsp;negotiation between a trade union, bargaining collectively&nbsp;on behalf of its members, and the employer(s).&nbsp;Suppose that the workers in an industry organize themselves&nbsp;under a single union so that the monopsonist&nbsp;employer now faces a monopoly union - a bilateral monopoly. In this case the two sides will settle the&nbsp;wage through collective bargaining. The outcome of&nbsp;bargaining depends on the objective and strength of each&nbsp;side as shown in the following graph.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6d14ff83da2a85e17e7a80e3ca70088a" alt="" width="325" height="233"><br><br>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in&nbsp;the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and&nbsp;restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. The successful resistance from&nbsp;the trade union sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, which will&nbsp;kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity&nbsp;in the marginal cost curve of labour. <br><br>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra&nbsp;workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour&nbsp;is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will&nbsp;employ L<sub>2</sub> workers. <br><br>Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the&nbsp;workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer&nbsp;actually employs more workers. It is only when&nbsp;the union forces the wage rate above W3 that employment&nbsp;starts to fall. <br><br>Thus the theory of wage determination can be modified&nbsp;to analyse various labour market imperfections such as&nbsp;the trade unions setting up the wage level or influencing&nbsp;the market through various other measures.</li>

This usually&nbsp;occurs in a perfectly free market. Consumer spending is&nbsp;comparable to votes in an election. The businesses which&nbsp;receive the most votes will be able to purchase the factors&nbsp;of production needed to produce the goods demanded&nbsp;by consumers. Therefore the firms receiving no votes&nbsp;will go out of business.</p>
<p>Total consumer sovereignty only exists if there is perfect&nbsp;knowledge or perfect information in the market place.&nbsp;If consumers are to allocate their resources in a way that&nbsp;maximise their utility, they need to know about the&nbsp;products they are buying. In many cases, consumers are&nbsp;well placed to make consumption decisions. A consumer,&nbsp;for instance, is likely to be the best judge of whether&nbsp;to buy bananas or apples.</p>
<p>So far as the theory of firms is concerned, consumer are&nbsp;said to be sovereign in a perfectly competitive market.&nbsp;Perfect competition is characterized by large number of&nbsp;relatively small firms producing homogeneous products&nbsp;in the absence of entry exit barriers. Price in such conditions&nbsp;is determined by total demand and supply forces&nbsp;in the market and each individual firm produces just a&nbsp;fraction of total output, therefore, a change in output by&nbsp;an individual firm does not affect the total market supply&nbsp;and hence the market price. Thus all the firms are&nbsp;price takers and each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand&nbsp;curve.</p>
<p>So, due to the highest degree of competition among firms,&nbsp;it is the collective decisions of consumers that decide&nbsp;what is produced, the quality, the distribution and the&nbsp;price charged. Firms producing products against the&nbsp;wishes of consumer would find it hard to survive. The&nbsp;consumer gains from the low price, since not only are&nbsp;costs kept low, but also there are no long run supernormal&nbsp;profits to add to cost. The consumers also enjoy&nbsp;allocative efficiency as not only they consume the products&nbsp;that they demand for but consume them up to the&nbsp;desired level. The consumer surplus is also maximised&nbsp;in that the consumers pay the lowest price possible for&nbsp;all quantities bought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are markets where consumers' dominance&nbsp;does not exist and they have to surrender their sovereignty&nbsp;to producers mainly due to the lack of sufficient&nbsp;competition. In a monopoly market situation the consumer&nbsp;would not be 'king'. This is because the producer,&nbsp;due to his better bargaining position, would decide&nbsp;on what to be produced, how to be produced, how&nbsp;much and for whom to be produced. The monopolist&nbsp;can raise its price and consumers have no alternative&nbsp;firm to turn to within the industry. They either pay a&nbsp;higher price or go without the good altogether. Unlike&nbsp;perfect competition, where consumers' preferences are&nbsp;given the highest weightage, it is monopolist who decides&nbsp;the price, and as he reduces the quantity, he raises&nbsp;the price. Thus consumer surplus is reduced. Also,&nbsp;monopolist, due to lack of competition, has little incentive&nbsp;to improve on his products or efficiency. All these&nbsp;weaken consumer sovereignty and therefore, undermine&nbsp;consumer's welfare.</p>
<p>In many imperfect markets, like those for cars, television&nbsp;sets or computers, consumers make infrequent purchases.&nbsp;If they buy, and find for whatever reason that&nbsp;they don't like the product, then it is very expensive&nbsp;to make a fresh choice. When they come to replace an&nbsp;item the product range may have changed completely.&nbsp;This is different from markets like food where consurners&nbsp;are making frequent purchases. In the food market,&nbsp;consumers can experiment at little cost and find the&nbsp;products they prefer. So in general, the less frequent the&nbsp;purchase, the less likely it is that consumers will have&nbsp;considerable influence on market decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on many occasions consumers may not be&nbsp;capable of making rational choices because of the technical&nbsp;nature of the product. For instance, consumers for&nbsp;the most part are unable to tell which make of freezer&nbsp;has the best insulation, which television set has the most&nbsp;durable components. Thus, markets in such industries&nbsp;are more likely to be dominated by producers because&nbsp;consumers ultimately have to rely on information provided&nbsp;by the sellers. <br>In conclusion, consumers' control is expected to exist in&nbsp;markets that are charged with competition and also where&nbsp;information is perfect such as perfect competition. However,&nbsp;consumer sovereignty is weakened when the degree&nbsp;of competition in a market is low or the market&nbsp;does not provide complete information to the consumers.&nbsp;Thus the balance between producer and consumer&nbsp;sovereignty may vary between markets but the producer&nbsp;is not the only determinant of market price and&nbsp;output.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 82</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9269</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Use the theory of marginal utility to analyse how a&nbsp;consumer will normally buy more of a product at a&nbsp;lower price than at a higher price and explain how this&nbsp;theory can be used to derive a market demand curve.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The theory of consumer behaviour explains consumer&nbsp;equilibrium with the help of equimarginal principle.&nbsp;Utility is the satisfaction that people derive from the&nbsp;consumption of goods and services. TU is the total&nbsp;satisfaction a consumer obtains from the consumption&nbsp;of all the units of a good consumed. While MU utility&nbsp;is the satisfaction gained from consuming one extra unit&nbsp;of a good within a given time period. It is measured by:&nbsp;TU<sub>n</sub> - TU<sub>n-1</sub> = MU.</p>
<p>The law of equimarginal utility states that the individual&nbsp;consumer is in equilibrium when it is not possible&nbsp;to switch a single penny's worth of expenditure from&nbsp;one product to another and obtain an increase in total&nbsp;utility. This occurs when:</p>
<p>MU<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b&nbsp;</sub>= ...... = MU<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>Where a, b, ..... , n are the various goods consumed.</p>
<p>The above equation states that the consumer equilibrium&nbsp;is where the marginal utility from the last penny&nbsp;spent on product a equals the utility from the last&nbsp;penny spent on product b equals the utility from the&nbsp;last penny spent on product n, thus taking into account&nbsp;all of the products the individual consumes.</p>
<p>When this&nbsp;situation is reached it is not possible for the individual&nbsp;to increase his total utility by reallocating expenditure.&nbsp;So the consumer equilibrium is important for it is where&nbsp;the consumer has allocated his or her income in such a&nbsp;way that maximum utility has been achieved. The analysis&nbsp;assumes the following:</p>
<p>Satisfaction can be measured in utils. A util is an imaginary&nbsp;unit of satisfaction from the consumption of a good.&nbsp;Consumer is rational, and therefore wants to maximize&nbsp;satisfaction also his taste and preferences are constant.&nbsp;Consumer has a fixed income, and he will be spending&nbsp;on two normal goods a and b. Product a costing £2.00&nbsp;each and product b costing £4.00 each, and that the&nbsp;individual has an income per time period of £16.00. The&nbsp;table below will help to explain consumer equilibrium.</p>

<p>Given this situation, it can be seen that the consumer&nbsp;is in equilibrium when he consumes four units of&nbsp;product a and two of product b. Here MU/P is the&nbsp;same, i.e. 8 for both products. Note that in equilibrium&nbsp;the consumer spends £8 (£2 x 4) on product a and&nbsp;£8 (£4 x 2) on product b and obtains total utility of&nbsp;268 utils. It is impossible for the consumer with an&nbsp;income of £16.00 to obtain a higher level of total utility.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use marginal utility as a means of&nbsp;deriving a demand curve. If, for instance, price of product b were to fall to £2.00, then assuming everything&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.2em;">else remained constant, there would be a new column&nbsp;</span>for MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b&nbsp;</sub>and a new equilibrium would result. In order&nbsp;to restore equilibrium the consumer would reduce consumption&nbsp;of product a by 1 unit and increase the consumption&nbsp;of product b by 3 units. Hence, he will&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.2em;">consume 3 units of a and 5 units of b at the new&nbsp;</span>equilibrium position. We can use this example to construct&nbsp;the consumer's demand curve for product b as&nbsp;given below;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/163976e41a48565aa2069e43a4653641" alt="" width="279" height="191"><br><br>A decrease in P<sub>b</sub> has resulted an increase in QD<sub>b</sub> because&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.2em;">with the given income and new price of product b&nbsp;</span>consumers maximizes satisfaction at a higher quantity&nbsp;of product b. Thus it is possible to develop a theoretical&nbsp;link between utility, price and the demand for a product.</p>
<p>If this is what each consumer does, it is also what all&nbsp;consumers taken together do. Thus the theory of consumer&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.2em;">behavior predicts a negatively sloped market&nbsp;</span>demand curve. The market demand curve is the horizontal&nbsp;sum of the quantities demanded by all individual&nbsp;buyers at various prices per period of time. So market&nbsp;demand curve represents the aggregation of demand&nbsp;curves of all individual buyers. Assuming there are only&nbsp;three two buyers of the product and we have already&nbsp;derived the demand curve for individual buyers using&nbsp;utility principle. The graph below shows the aggregation.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/979ad21dbaaea932f2120d0072200e45" alt="" width="394" height="136"></p>
<p>The figure above illustrates the aggregation over consumers.&nbsp;At a price of $9 consumer A buys 2 units and&nbsp;consumer B buys 7 units; thus together they purchase&nbsp;9 units, yielding one point on the market demand curve.&nbsp;We generate the second point on $6 in the same manner&nbsp;and hence derive the market demand curve. No&nbsp;matter&nbsp;how many consumers are involved, the process is the&nbsp;same. We simply need to add the quantities&nbsp;demanded&nbsp;by all consumers at each price, and the result is the&nbsp;market demand curve.</p>
<p>So, by the use of utility it is possible to demonstrate&nbsp;the logic of 'rational' consumer choice and derive the&nbsp;demand&nbsp;curve of an individual consumer. The market&nbsp;demand curve is derived simply by aggregation of&nbsp;individuals'&nbsp;demand curves.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 83</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9267</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The objectives of firms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unilever, a multinational global food manufacturer, with many branded products, has announced a partnership&nbsp;with Oxfam, the international relief agency, to help farmers in developing countries. Unilever welcomed the&nbsp;partnership and said that their objective was 'to double the size of our business while halving our environmental&nbsp;impact. We want to do this by maximising the positive social impact of our business. A major element&nbsp;of this is to promote better livelihoods by incorporating 500000 small farms in developing countries and&nbsp;small-scale distributors into our supply chain. This way we hope to have a positive impact on the lives&nbsp;of people living in poverty.'</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Historically, companies in the food and drink industry have tried to improve efficiency and minimise costs&nbsp;by reducing the number of international suppliers they use. However, Oxfam said that firms are now starting&nbsp;to consider new ethical business models about how they source their produce. There is a need to move away&nbsp;from a short-term focus on profit margins and consider long-term objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2011 a drugs company, GlaxoSmithKline, (GSK), manufactured a new medicine which had a higher market&nbsp;price than a rival medicine from another company. The medicine was expensive to research and produce. The&nbsp;expected annual revenue for the company from the sale of the medicine was estimated to be around US$314m;&nbsp;the annual cost of hospital treatment with the medicine for just one patient was around US$23000. A&nbsp;government negotiated a new type of deal with GSK. The company agreed that it would supply public sector&nbsp;hospitals with the medicine at the same price as its rival's product. It would also return some of the revenue&nbsp;it received from the hospitals if its product proved to be less successful than the rival product. The government&nbsp;said it was introducing a 'value-based pricing model'. A spokesperson for GSK said 'we are moving&nbsp;in the direction where price is determined by value and value is determined by evidence'.</p>

<li>Unilever is a giant multinational company and its size suggests that it is large relative to the size of the&nbsp;market. Thus, it is expected that Unilever operates in an imperfect market, more likely in an oligopolistic&nbsp;market. In such a market a firm usually operates with some control over market price. The idea of&nbsp;imperfect market is reinforced by the fact that Unilever sells many branded products, which implies that&nbsp;there exists competition on factors such as advertisement, product variation etc.<br><br></li>
<li>Firstly, Unilever's stated aim of doubling its size suggests that it hopes to increase its market share and&nbsp;therefore expects to achieve economies of scale. However, its policy measure of incorporating 500000&nbsp;small farms and small scale distributors into the supply chain conflicts with its stated objective. This is&nbsp;because they are oriented more towards perfect competition and therefore against the idea of larger size.&nbsp;Secondly, their stated objectives of halving their environmental impact and doubling their size could conflict&nbsp;with each other. Unilever has a policy of improving efficiency by reducing international suppliers. It says&nbsp;its future aim would be to halve their environmental impact. However, in contrast to limiting their transport&nbsp;and distribution to a few suppliers as they did in the past they are now expanding their distribution&nbsp;network with more demand on resources and transport pollution. All of these could ultimately lead them&nbsp;to have a greater environmental impact.<br><br></li>
<li>R＆D, though costly and risky, but it is encouraged by a strong competitive environment. Managing&nbsp;innovations better than one's competitor is one of the ways to maintain the firm's foothold in the market.&nbsp;Not only this, firms spend on R＆D with the hope of creating new products for which there is high&nbsp;demand. So, firms spend on R＆D with the hope that a successful outcome and the resulting revenues&nbsp;and profits earned by selling new products could more than offset the high cost involved.<br><br></li>
<li>Different policy measures, both by Unilever and GSK, suggest that they made an effort to increase their&nbsp;sales, Unilever by doubling its size and GSK by selling its new medicine to the government hospitals.&nbsp;This could be attributed to their desire for profit maximization. However, the article does not give information&nbsp;about their pricing policy of other products which could have been useful in determining their profit&nbsp;maximizing behavior. Similarly a comparative analysis of profit earned by competitors relative to these&nbsp;two firms would have clearly indicated their behavior. However, the information on competitors profit&nbsp;is not given.<br><br>On the other hand both Unilever going into partnership with Oxfam to help farmers in developing countries&nbsp;and their stated objective of halving the environmental impact suggest that Unilever aiming only to maximize&nbsp;profit. Also, Oxfam acknowledging the behavior of firms to adopt ethical business model implies that&nbsp;Unilever is not truly in the pursuit of pure profit. Similarly, GSK's deal with government to provide&nbsp;medicine at the same price as its rival's product and returning part of the revenue that it earned is not&nbsp;consistent with profit maximizing behavior of a firm. It may be argued, however, that this agreement with&nbsp;the government is more likely to secure a constant demand for GSK from government hospitals and would&nbsp;in the long run enable a more secure growth in profits.<br><br>It, therefore, follows that the information provided is insufficient to conclude that both Unilever and GSK&nbsp;are not in pursuit of profit maximization.</li>

Though not all governments will&nbsp;share these objectives, yet it is also true that there will&nbsp;be trade-offs and potential conflicts between the objectives,&nbsp;and different governments will attach differing&nbsp;priorities to them. The following are the traditional&nbsp;macroeconomic aims of governments.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low unemployment<br></strong>It is important to keep unemployment levels as low as&nbsp;possible. High unemployment is expensive for the government&nbsp;and, therefore, for the taxpayer. For every&nbsp;unemployed person, there are. two costs to the government. First, the unemployed workers will be entitled to&nbsp;benefit. Secondly, there is the less obvious cost of the&nbsp;loss of tax revenues, both from direct and indirect taxes,&nbsp;which the workers would have paid in work. Then there&nbsp;is the cost to the whole economy as unemployment&nbsp;involves a loss of potential output and hence lower living&nbsp;standard in general. Young unemployed workers may&nbsp;inflict other external costs on the society, crime for&nbsp;example.</li>
<li><strong>Price stability</strong> <br>Control of inflation is important because if inflation&nbsp;gets out of control, the economy stops growing. The&nbsp;authorities are forced to raise interest rates . to counter&nbsp;inflation. At higher interest rate consumers stop borrowing&nbsp;to spend and firms also reduce borrowing to&nbsp;invest. Exports become less competitive and the&nbsp;economy may well drop into a recession.</li>
<li><strong>High but sustainable economic growth</strong> <br>Economic growth is a measure of rate of change of real&nbsp;GDP over a period of time. High rate of growth can be&nbsp;achieved by bringing unemployed resources at work or&nbsp;alternatively, by improving productivity of existing&nbsp;resources. Governments seek to achieve high but sustainable&nbsp;growth rate mainly because it leads to improved&nbsp;living standards and economic stability.</li>
<li><strong>Balance of payments in equilibrium</strong> <br>BOP is a summary of all economic transactions of a&nbsp;country with other nations over one year time period.&nbsp;A persistent BOP deficit initially results in a decline of&nbsp;a nation's foreign currency reserves and a run on its&nbsp;exchange rate. Ultimately, it necessitates borrowing and&nbsp;the country accumulates foreign debts, which have to be&nbsp;repaid with interest in future. The ideal situation represents&nbsp;a position where, at least over a number of years,&nbsp;the nation spends and invests abroad no more than other&nbsp;nations spend or invest in it. <br><br>As stated above limiting the rate of inflation is one of&nbsp;the four main macroeconomic goals. However, perusing&nbsp;this objective is potentially in conflict with achieving&nbsp;economic growth and full employment. Too much money&nbsp;spent could prove to be inflationary at least in the short&nbsp;run. The economy might also have strain on the balance&nbsp;of payment as its imports are likely to rise. Nonetheless&nbsp;the resulting increase in AD could lead to a rise in the&nbsp;level of employment and the economy might achieve&nbsp;economic growth. <br><br>In theory, at least, the choice of the objectives depends&nbsp;on the current state of the economy. In times of economic&nbsp;recession government, for instance, could try and&nbsp;achieve the highest possible economic growth or lowest&nbsp;unemployment rate. In such a situation government will&nbsp;be prepared to compromise on the rising inflation rate. <br><br>In conclusion it can be said that the order of priority&nbsp;of these objectives depends on the current economic&nbsp;situation and the preference of the government in office.&nbsp;But all governments in all nations ultimately desire these&nbsp;same objectives in their quest for the welfare of people&nbsp;and economic stability.</li>

<li>Development economics classifies different economies&nbsp;into developed and developing economies. The former refers to economically advanced and technologically independent countries are classified as developed nations while latter is further classified into underdeveloped,&nbsp;undeveloped and newly industrialized economy. Although all of the above mentioned economies are broadly classified as developing economies but differentiated development&nbsp;will exist among them. All in all these countries&nbsp;are mainly characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technological dependence on developed economies.<br><br>The population structure of a country is how it is made up of people of different ages, and of males and females.<br><br>Developing countries differ greatly in age structure of their population from developed countries. Almost all the developing countries possess high population growth potential characterized by high birth rate and high but declining death rate. On the contrary low or no population growth in developed countries is attributed to the low birth rate and death rate low. An important consequence of high birth-rate in developing countries is that a larger proportion is in younger age group. The percentage of population under 15 years of age is about 40 in developing countries compared with only 25% in developing countries. Moreover 90% of the dependants are children in developed countries whereas their percentage is 66 in developed countries. Developing countries have also a shorter life expectancy which means a smaller fraction of their population available as an effective labour force. Average life expectancy at birth is roughly 51 years whereas it is over 75% in developed countries. Thus developed countries face the problem of aging population. The higher standard of health care increases the average life expectancy. Also the change in life style and social values lower the birth rate. Thus the ratio of dependent population rises i.e. a smaller proportion of population works to support a growing aging population.<br><br>Thus the typical population pyramid of a developing country is wide at the base, which means there are a large proportion of young people in the country. It tapers&nbsp;very quickly as we go up into the older age groups, and is narrow at the top. This shows that a very small proportion of people are elderly. While the population pyramid showing age structure of a developed country is narrow at the base, wider in the middle, and stays quite wide until the very top, as there is a sizable percentage of older people.<br><br>Employment structure means how the workforce is divided up between the three main employment sectors primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary jobs involve getting raw materials from the natural environment e.g. mining, farming and fishing. Secondary jobs involve manufacturing e.g. making cars and steel. Tertiary jobs involve providing a service e.g. teaching and nursing.<br><br>So far as the employment structure is concerned, tertiary sector employs the largest proportion of labour force in the developed economies followed by secondary and then primary sector. Their manufacturing and construction are geared towards high value products and structures. In contrast to this, most developing economies are oriented toward the production of primary&nbsp;products (agriculture, fuel, forestry, and raw materials) as opposed to secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary&nbsp;(service) activities. Vast majority of people in developing&nbsp;countries lives and works in rural areas. Over 65% are rurally based, compared to less than 27% in economically developed countries. Similarly, on average, 58% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture, compared to only 5% in developed nations. Agriculture contributes about 14% of the total output of developing nations but only 3% of the GNP of developed nations <br><br>Thus primary sector employs a relatively higher proportion of the labour force in developing countries. Their manufacturing sector comprises of small scale cottage industry providing limited employment opportunities and the tertiary sector employs the least of the total labour force.<br><br>From the above explanation it can be concluded that the age and employment structure vary to a large extent between developed and developing countries.<br><br></li>
<li>Developing countries are mainly characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technological dependence on developed economies.<br><br>In developing nations general levels of living tend to be very low for the vast majority of people. This is true not only in relation to their counterparts in rich nations but often also in relation to small elite groups within their own societies. These low levels of living are manifested quantitatively and qualitatively in the form of low incomes (poverty), inadequate housing, poor health, limited education, high infant mortality, low life and work expectancies, and in many cases a general sense of malaise and hopelessness.<br><br>In developing countries two-thirds or more of the people live in rural areas and their main occupation is agriculture. Such countries, therefore specialize in the production of raw materials and foodstuffs. These countries do possess natural resources but many of those resources remain unutilized or underutilized due to various inhibition such as lack of technical knowledge and nonavailability&nbsp;of capital.<br><br>Furthermore, there is vast open unemployment and disguised unemployment in developing countries. The unemployment spreads with urbanization and the spread of education because the manufacturing sector fails to expand along with the growth of labour force. Along with the rapid spread of urbanization and the urban bias strategies, has come the prolific growth of huge slums and shantytowns which results in overcrowding and pollution. Favelas of Rio de Janeiro and the bastees of Calcutta, such makeshift communities have been doubling in size every 5 to 10 years. Today slum settlements represent over one-third of the ur-ban population in all developing countries; in many cases they account for more than 66% of the urban total. Most of the settlements are without clean water, sewage systems, or electricity. For example, metropolitan Cairo is attempting to cope with a population of 10 million people with a water and sanitation system built to serve 2 million. Over all particular manifestations of economic backwardness in developing countries are low labour efficiency, factor immobility, and limited specialization. In addition lack of adequate infrastructure, for whatever reason, such as roads, bridges railways harbours etc. results in lower mobility of workers and goods leading to lower incomes and pockets of high regional unemployment. <br><br>Insufficiency of capital equipment is another general characteristic of such countries. There is not only small capital stock but the current rate of capital formation is low. The root cause of this capital deficiency is the problem of low savings resulting from low incomes. Apart from the low stock of capitala developed countries use backward state of technology. Their technological backwardness is reflected, firstly, in high average cost of production despite low money wages, secondly in high labour capital ratio. <br><br>The issues of unemployment, overcrowding and pollution are often related to the developing countries however these issues are not typical of developing countries rather they can be found in developed countries as much as in developing countries. The issue of unemployment in developed countries particularly in recent years, is as much of problem for these countries as for developing countries but the phenomenon of unemployment is more of cyclical nature as opposed to structural nature in developing countries. Similarly the issue of overcrowding is as prevelant in some of the large cities of developed countries as in the large cities of developing countries. Even In big cities of developed countries overcrowding puts a strain on civic facilities however the governments in these countries usually have resources and technical expertise to reduce the severity of the problem. Similarly, due to the high degree of industrialization, the level of pollution is even higher in developed countries. However with the growing awareness and high incomes these countries can spare resources to manage the level of pollution. <br><br>Thus, from the explanation above it follows that the issues of unemployment, overcrowding and pollution are not the typical characteristics of developing countries. These issues are also faced by many of the developed countries, therefore only on these grounds it is not possible to classify a country as developing.</li>

Economic theory predicts that&nbsp;most businesses operate with the objective of maximizing&nbsp;profits. If the businesses are unable to earn any profits then&nbsp;they aim at minimizing loss. In the short run, if the loss is&nbsp;larger than its fixed costs then the business minimizes loss&nbsp;by a temporary closure. However, if the businesses forecast&nbsp;loss in the long run then they could decide a permanent&nbsp;closure. Thus the decision about closure is related to the&nbsp;firm's inability to cover its costs. Apart from the cost related&nbsp;reasons a business may decide to close due to uncertainties&nbsp;caused by war with other countries or worsening&nbsp;law and order situation prevailing in the country.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, lack of clear objectives and plans,&nbsp;inferior thoughts, and bad operating decisions are key indications&nbsp;of poor management that can bring down a business&nbsp;organization to complete cessation. Many poorly managed&nbsp;businesses close on failure to overcome business difficulties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when a business runs out of money and has&nbsp;exhausted the most convenient funding remedies, it is doubly&nbsp;difficult to address impinging working capital requirements.&nbsp;Particularly where short and long-term credit facilities&nbsp;are scarce, a business cannot focus and operate successfully&nbsp;while it is always in the run for day-today money.</p>
<p>Financial capacity transcends ensuring a stream of positive&nbsp;cash flows. It requires sufficiency of conveniently available&nbsp;funds to support the development and launching of new&nbsp;products, acquisition of necessary equipment or facilities,&nbsp;hiring of additional high-skilled employees, or implementing&nbsp;new marketing programs. The rationale behind this bigger&nbsp;capital provision is to take advantage of opportunities,&nbsp;mitigate threats, correct internal weaknesses, and build competitive&nbsp;advantage. Thus lack of funds availability from banks&nbsp;could frustrate business plans and might lead to finally a&nbsp;closure.</p>
<p>Quite often when sales success is confused with how fast&nbsp;a business can grow, overexpansion happens, leading to a&nbsp;business going bankrupt because of the high cost, dysfunctions&nbsp;associated with rapid expansion.</p>
<p>Some businesses are forced to close because they do not&nbsp;comply with their statutory duties. It is the fundamental&nbsp;duty of every business organization to be fully compliant&nbsp;with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations. It must&nbsp;follow all applicable tax statutes, business permit provisions,&nbsp;and licensing regulations to preclude serious legal violations&nbsp;that can cause the business to shut down.</p>
<p>Thus closure of a business could result from unavailability&nbsp;of funds as well as due to other problems. However the&nbsp;decision of a permanent or temporary closure depends on the&nbsp;nature and severity of problem. On many occasion a shortterm&nbsp;closure could lead to a permanent closure if the business&nbsp;fails to understand the severity and forecasts the duration of&nbsp;the problem inaccurately.</p>
<p>The impact of a business closure on employment and the&nbsp;economy as a whole depends on the size of the business.&nbsp;Closure of a large business might generate negative sentiments&nbsp;among businesses and workers leading to a cautious&nbsp;approach by everyone leading to a number of firms closing&nbsp;down. Such a situation could pave the way to recession in&nbsp;the economy.</p>
<p>Recession represents an adverse economic climate where&nbsp;people lose jobs and purchasing power and tightly hold back&nbsp;on spending. It is a situation that generally causes depressed&nbsp;demand for goods and services, which, in turn, generates steep&nbsp;declines in business revenues. Rising costs, tight credit, pricecutting,&nbsp;and limited investment are attendant developments&nbsp;that aggravate sluggish business condition under recession.&nbsp;Recession saps the vitality and rocks the longevity of many&nbsp;businesses regardless of their sizes. The inherent potential of&nbsp;recession to abbreviate the life of any business is time-proven&nbsp;and a cold reality to contend with.</p>
<p>Thus under normal circumstances when the general sentiments&nbsp;of people are positive about the business environment&nbsp;a closure, temporary or permanent, will have little impact if&nbsp;any.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 87</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9245</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Some workers producing non-essential luxury goods or services&nbsp;are paid very highly. The wage rate is not related to&nbsp;the economic value of a good or service but more to social&nbsp;factors or fashion. The economic theory of wages is, therefore,&nbsp;of little use in explaining wage differentials.&nbsp;Assess this argument.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive&nbsp;labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply of labour. Many firms competing with one another in hiring&nbsp;a specific type of labour characterize this type of market.&nbsp;Also, there are numerous qualified workers with identical&nbsp;skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge,&nbsp;perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently,&nbsp;both firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal&nbsp;revenue product, MRP<sub>L</sub>, is the increase in revenue due&nbsp;to employing one more unit of labour. MRPL is determined&nbsp;by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied&nbsp;by the MR i.e. MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> × MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is&nbsp;no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward,&nbsp;indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must&nbsp;bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e67524fe434f154eb70c8802919d50fd" alt="" width="417" height="185"></p>
<p>In the figure above, both equilibrium wage rate and level of&nbsp;employment are determined by the intersection of the market&nbsp;demand and supply curves as depicted in the left panel of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to&nbsp;hire this type of labor up to the point at which its marginal&nbsp;revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is equal to marginal cost of labour&nbsp;(MC<sub>L</sub>) as shown in the right panel of the graph. At a wage rate above OW the number of workers available to work is in excess than the employment opportunities. While at a&nbsp;wage rate below OW there exists a shortage of workers.&nbsp;Thus a mismatch between QD and QS in either situation&nbsp;forces the wage rate to equilibrium position.</p>
<p>The theory further assumes that changes in the market forces of demand and supply will eventually restore a stable equilibrium at a new wage level. <br>Demand for labour curve shifts if one of the conditions of demand changes. As mentioned above that the demand for&nbsp;labour curve is derived from the MRP curve, which, in turn,&nbsp;is calculated by MPP x MR. Therefore if there is an&nbsp;improvement in labour productivity then this will mean that&nbsp;the workers will produce more at any given wage rate and&nbsp;the MPP curve will shift to the right, shifting the MRP&nbsp;curve to the right. Similarly, if the price of the good being&nbsp;produced changes, say due to the change in fashion or preference,&nbsp;then this will change the MR and hence the MRP&nbsp;at all wage levels and the MRP curve will shift leading to&nbsp;a change in wage rate as shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a7afb443df5481cfa85477c75daa03d7" alt="" width="328" height="274"></p>
<p>We can see how shifts in demand curve will affect the equilibrium&nbsp;wage and labour employed. The initial equilibrium is&nbsp;wage W<sub>1</sub> and employment L<sub>1</sub>. If, for example, there were an&nbsp;improvement in the productivity levels of the workers in an&nbsp;industry say due to a more efficient use of labour through&nbsp;shift, then the labour demand curve (MRP curve) would&nbsp;shift to the right, causing a rise in the real wage rate to W<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and a rise in numbers employed to L<sub>2</sub>. Likewise a fall in the&nbsp;price of the good, say due to a change in trend or fashion&nbsp;would make the value of MRP to fall for all wage levels, and&nbsp;so the labour demand curve would shift to the left, giving&nbsp;wage W<sub>3</sub> and labour employed L<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Thus the demand for labour is greatly affected by the value&nbsp;of its MRP. The higher the MRP of labour the greater the&nbsp;demand for labour and the higher will be wages going to&nbsp;labour and the wage and vice versa.Hence wage differentials&nbsp;between different occupations could be linked with differences&nbsp;in their values of MRP<sub>L</sub>.</p>
<p>Just like the demand for labour, changes in supply of labour&nbsp;can also lead to a change in equilibrium wage rate and&nbsp;employment. An increase, for instance, in the number of&nbsp;people in the economy available to work in the given industry&nbsp;will increase supply. This could be because of an increase&nbsp;in net immigration or a change in the demographics of the&nbsp;economy. These increases in numbers will shift the supply&nbsp;of labour curve to the right. A less obvious cause is the&nbsp;situation in other industries. If, in relative terms, the wage&nbsp;rate becomes less attractive in a similar industry, or the&nbsp;working conditions deteriorate, then the industry in question&nbsp;will experience an increase in the number of workers offering&nbsp;their labour services. This will shift the supply of labour&nbsp;curve to the right.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/86bbcb6321c2cc5ac4718e79c9967d6c" alt="" width="351" height="295"></p>
<p>In the diagram above, we can see what happens to the&nbsp;equilibrium when the supply curve shifts. A shift to the right&nbsp;causes the wage rate to fall (from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>) and the numbers&nbsp;employed to rise (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>2</sub>). A shift to the left&nbsp;causes the real wage rate to rise (from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>3</sub>) and the&nbsp;numbers employed to fall (from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p>Thus some wage differentials arise because basic human&nbsp;characteristics cause the supply of some types of labour to&nbsp;remain low relative to the demand for it, even in the long run.&nbsp;For instance, pop stars or footballers where relatively rare&nbsp;ability is required. Similarly if a job requires specific qualifications&nbsp;training then supply of labour will be reduced and&nbsp;wages higher; For instance, barristers and doctors need good&nbsp;qualifications and a long period training which limits the&nbsp;number of people who are able to do these job.</p>
<p>However differences in wages between different occupations&nbsp;could result from some other factors not accounted by the&nbsp;economic theory. If trade unions and professional bodies, for&nbsp;instance, can limit entry into certain occupations by apprenticeships&nbsp;and the need to pass exams then supply will be&nbsp;limited and wage higher. Thus industries with a strong trade&nbsp;union are likely to pay more than those with a weak trade&nbsp;union.</p>
<p>Likewise some forms of social factors such as discrimination&nbsp;makes it difficult, or impossible, for certain groups to take&nbsp;certain jobs, even if they are equipped by skill and education&nbsp;for these jobs. Thus due to the discriminatory practices the&nbsp;supply in certain occupations remains low and hence results&nbsp;in higher wages compared to the occupation not really&nbsp;affected by social discrimination.</p>
<p>Sometimes the supply of labour to a particular occupation&nbsp;may be limited because the job is dangerous or dirty. Such&nbsp;occupations may command higher wages, as for miners. Other&nbsp;jobs, such as teaching or the civil service, have pleasant&nbsp;working conditions, job security and good pension schemes.&nbsp;Consequently, such jobs may earn lower wages. Similarly&nbsp;some jobs may have a great many perks and fringe benefits&nbsp;and the money wages may be lower because of these advantage.<br>Many wage inequalities result from several types of market&nbsp;imperfections which impede workers from moving from their&nbsp;current jobs to take higher-paying jobs. For instance workers&nbsp;may simply not be aware of job opportunities and wage&nbsp;rates in other geographic areas and in other jobs for which&nbsp;they qualify. Consequently, the flow of qualified labor from&nbsp;lower-paying to higher-paying jobs - and thus the&nbsp;adjustments in labor supply - may not be sufficient to&nbsp;equalize wages within occupations.</p>
<p>It can thus be concluded that the economic theory gives only&nbsp;a limited account of wage differences between occupations.&nbsp;In real world, however, these differences could arise due to&nbsp;many other factors not explained by the theory.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 88</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9234</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>Oligopoly refers to a market where there are a few&nbsp;relatively large firms in the market usually producing a&nbsp;large number of brands. Each firm is of a sufficiently&nbsp;large size so that the decision taken by one firm will&nbsp;affect the decisions taken by the other firms in the&nbsp;market. The firms are, therefore, mutually dependent.&nbsp;Thus it is an industry where there is a high level of&nbsp;market concentration. This implies that the number of&nbsp;firms is small enough for each firm to realize that its&nbsp;competitors may respond to anything that it does and&nbsp;that it should take such possible responses into account.&nbsp;Therefore, there is no single theory of how firms determine&nbsp;price and output under conditions of oligopoly. In&nbsp;addition to product branding it is assumed that barriers&nbsp;to entry are fairly substantial and knowledge is by no&nbsp;means perfect, as in the perfectly competitive market.<br><br>Perfect competition, on the other hand, describes the&nbsp;market structure where large number of relatively small&nbsp;firms producing homogeneous product that are perfect&nbsp;substitute. This leads to all firms being "price takers"&nbsp;with a perfectly elastic demand curve for their product.&nbsp;In addition, there exists perfect information and freedom&nbsp;of entry and exit from the industry. Since the individual&nbsp;firm is powerless to change the price of its product,&nbsp;therefore, it maximizes profit by adjusting output to the&nbsp;point where its marginal revenue equals marginal cost.&nbsp;Price in such a market, therefore, changes due to the&nbsp;change in market forces of demand and supply.<br><br>However in oligopolistic market firms, in order to decide&nbsp;on pricing strategies, face a basic dilemma between&nbsp;competition and cooperation. Thus there is a possibility&nbsp;of price competition. But price wars prove to be costly&nbsp;therefore they are short lived. Due to the threat of price&nbsp;wars and the existence of effective alternative strategies,&nbsp;oligopolists may engage in non-price competition. This&nbsp;can take a number of different forms such as product&nbsp;differentiation, where oligopolists can, through advertising,&nbsp;create a brand image for their product. The firm&nbsp;may offer a particular after-sales service or package the&nbsp;product in a particular way.<br><br>However, there is much to be gained from cooperation&nbsp;in the form of collusion. Collusion is an agreement on&nbsp;price charged and level of output produced. Thus it&nbsp;makes it possible for oligopolists to act as a monopoly&nbsp;and achieve maximum profits for the industry.<br><br>Collusion can take different forms. It can be a formal or&nbsp;overt collusion, with agreement being reached between&nbsp;the firms as to what price to charge or what output to&nbsp;produce. This type of formal agreement is known as&nbsp;a cartel and is illegal in many countries. The other type&nbsp;is called tacit collusion. This is where firms behave in&nbsp;a cooperative way but do not have a formal agreement.&nbsp;The most common form of tacit collusion is price leadership&nbsp;where price set by one firm becomes the benchmark&nbsp;for other firms.<br><br>Often the price leader in an oligopolistic market is the&nbsp;dominant firm. In this situation the largest or the most&nbsp;efficient firm takes the lead in setting the price which&nbsp;the other firms follow, possibly because they fear that&nbsp;not doing so would lead to a price war. The other form&nbsp;of price leadership is called barometric price leadership.&nbsp;The price leader may be a small firm but one which has&nbsp;a close knowledge of the market and the prevailing&nbsp;economic conditions. In this situation the barometric firm&nbsp;may institute a price change which the other firms in the&nbsp;oligopolistic market follow.<br><br>Price rigidity in a non-collusive oligopoly is explained&nbsp;by the kinked demand curve. It assumes that a business&nbsp;might face a dual demand curve for its product based on&nbsp;the likely reactions of other firms in the market to a&nbsp;change in its price. The common assumption of the&nbsp;theory is that firms in an oligopoly are looking to protect&nbsp;and maintain their market share and that rival firms&nbsp;are unlikely to match another's price increase but may&nbsp;match a price fall. The graph below illustrates this situation.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8439c7f3a45a18056b7d68b9f71d0a7f" alt="" width="590" height="405"><br><br>If a business raises price and others leave their prices&nbsp;constant, then we can expect quite a large substitution&nbsp;effect away from this firm making demand relatively&nbsp;price elastic. The business would then lose market share&nbsp;and expect to see a fall in its total revenue. <br><br>If a business reduces price but other firms follow suit,&nbsp;the relative price change is much smaller and demand&nbsp;would be inelastic in respect of the price change. Cutting&nbsp;prices when demand is inelastic also leads to a fall&nbsp;in total revenue with little or no effect on market share.&nbsp;The kinked demand curve model therefore makes a prediction&nbsp;that a business might reach a stable profit maximising&nbsp;equilibrium at price P<sub>1</sub> and output Q<sub>1</sub> and&nbsp;have little incentive to alter prices. <br>Thus the oligopolistic firms have to decide about particular&nbsp;pricing and output decision after taking account&nbsp;of possible reactions of rival firms. There is, therefore&nbsp;limited scope of price fluctuations rather in most situations&nbsp;firms maintain their prices and compete more on&nbsp;factors such as branding, quality variation, after sale&nbsp;services and advertisement.</li>
<li>According to economic theory a monopoly exists when&nbsp;there is one firm in the industry. It is characterized by&nbsp;selling a unique product and high entry barriers. Compared&nbsp;with other market structures, demand under&nbsp;monopoly will be relatively inelastic at each price. This&nbsp;gives monopolist substantial powers to charge a high&nbsp;price. Nevertheless, it is still constrained by its demand&nbsp;curve i.e. a rise in price will lower the quantity&nbsp;demanded. In order for a firm to maintain its monopoly&nbsp;position there must be barriers to the entry of new firms.&nbsp;Barriers can be of various forms. Such as economies of&nbsp;scale, high capital cost, legal barriers and various marketing&nbsp;barriers.<br><br>While monopolistic competition incorporates feature of&nbsp;both perfect competition and monopoly. As with perfect&nbsp;competition there is freedom of entry into the&nbsp;industry. There are many relatively small firms in the&nbsp;market, each producing goods which are slightly different&nbsp;from their competitors. The existence of product&nbsp;differentiation means that firms have a&nbsp;certain degree of monopoly power, thus&nbsp;if they raise their price they do not lose&nbsp;all their buyers even though they produce&nbsp;products which are close substitutes.&nbsp;The result is a downward sloping&nbsp;relatively elastic demand curve. Thus a&nbsp;monopolistically competitive firm is not&nbsp;a price taker. Product differentiation can&nbsp;be reinforced through advertising which&nbsp;produces an element of brand loyalty. <br><br>Under monopolisitic competition, freedom&nbsp;of entry eliminates supernormal&nbsp;profit and forces the firm to produce&nbsp;where its AR = AC. The effect is to&nbsp;keep the long run prices down. Under&nbsp;monopoly, however, barriers to entry allow profits to remain supernormal in the long run.&nbsp;Hence the monopolist is not forced to produce where&nbsp;its AR = AC. Thus, other things remaining the same, a&nbsp;comparison of profit maximizing position for an industry&nbsp;under monopoly with that of a firm in monopolistic&nbsp;competition reveals that long run price will tend to be&nbsp;higher and output lower under monopoly.&nbsp;<br><br>Furthermore, competition and availability of close substitutes&nbsp;requires the firm in a monopolistically competitive&nbsp;market to use the most efficient known technique.&nbsp;The monopolist sheltered by barriers to entry can still&nbsp;make large profits even if it is not using the most&nbsp;efficient technique hence it has less incentive to be&nbsp;efficient. <br><br>In addition to this monopolies may lack the incentive&nbsp;to introduce new product varieties and large monopolies&nbsp;may be able to exert political pressure and thereby get&nbsp;favourable treatment from the government. On the other&nbsp;hand public interest is better served because firms in&nbsp;monopolistically competitive market provide a wide&nbsp;range of choice for the consumers choose from. <br><br>There are at least two additional costs associated with&nbsp;monopoly. One involves the resources used by individuals&nbsp;in order to obtain and maintain monopoly. Society also ends up expending resources in preventing&nbsp;monopolies or trying to break them up. The other cost&nbsp;involves possible inefficiencies within the monopoly firm&nbsp;i.e. monopolist is necessarily X-inefficient i.e. costs are&nbsp;not minimized by effective management.&nbsp;<br><br>In our analysis the assumption was that increase in competition&nbsp;does not change the cost structure. Of course,&nbsp;if monopoly results in higher marginal cost, then the&nbsp;cost to society is even greater. However, if monopoly&nbsp;results in cost savings, then the cost to society is less.&nbsp;A monopoly, for instance, may be able to achieve substantial&nbsp;economies of scale due to larger plant, centralised&nbsp;administration and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication&nbsp;(e.g. a monopoly gas company would eliminate&nbsp;the need for several sets of rival gas pipes under each&nbsp;street). If this results in an MC curve substantially below&nbsp;that of the same industry under monopolistic competition,&nbsp;the monopoly will produce a higher output at a&nbsp;lower price. In Figure below the monopoly produces&nbsp;Q<sub>1</sub> at a price of P<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0a3145a7c45dd8e1bca9170fec815e80" alt="" width="378" height="260"><br><br>It would benefit the society even more if the monopolist&nbsp;is forced by the government to follow marginal cost&nbsp;pricing (P = MC). The monopolist would charge the&nbsp;price P<sub>3</sub>, even lower than P<sub>1</sub> and produce higher output&nbsp;i.e. Q<sub>3</sub>. Also, the monopolist can use part of its supernormal&nbsp;profits for research and development and investment.&nbsp;It thus has a greater ability to become dynamically&nbsp;efficient than has the small firm with limited funds.&nbsp;Also, a perfectly contestable monopoly earns only&nbsp;normal profits and is as efficient as any other firm&nbsp;operating in a competitive environment. <br><br>Thus freedom of entry and hence lack of long run supernormal&nbsp;profits under monopolistic competition are likely&nbsp;to keep prices down for the consumer. However, on the&nbsp;other hand, monopolies are likely to achieve greater economies&nbsp;of scale and have more funds for research and&nbsp;development. Thus nothing definite can be concluded.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">The recent financial crisis has slowed down economic growth worldwide but the number of migrants seeking&nbsp;work in another country is still increasing. One reason for this is that the countries from which workers leave&nbsp;may have experienced a severe recession making workers willing to travel abroad to do unpopular jobs that&nbsp;others avoid. A further reason is that many migrants move to join other members of their family which helps&nbsp;explain why migration, once established, is hard to reverse.&nbsp;<br>Workers going abroad are particularly important for the Philippines, where 25% of the labour force work&nbsp;overseas. Doctors go abroad to work as nurses; teachers go to work as housemaids. In addition, local centres&nbsp;train workers to enable overseas work. For example, workers train to clean cabins on cruise ships in the hope&nbsp;that they will be able to earn four times the local wage for cleaning. The workers send money home (migrant&nbsp;remittances) to support their families. This money can provide food, clothing, housing, pay for educational&nbsp;expenses or for investment in small enterprises. <br>Migrant remittances could become even more important to a country because experts predict that aid and&nbsp;foreign direct investment in developing countries could be halved as a result of the 2009-2010 financial crisis. There is a debate about the use of migrant labour. For employers, there is an advantage in employing cheap&nbsp;foreign labour in order to reduce costs. However, the consequence of using foreign labour is that domestic&nbsp;workers are being replaced. There is also little or no incentive for manufacturers to mechanise their production&nbsp;processes because it is cheaper to use labour than invest in capital-intensive machinery. <br>The flow of money from migrant workers has been rising by as much as 33% each year in some areas, but&nbsp;the rate of growth is beginning to slow down. In 2007, the World Bank predicted that, by 2009, the amount&nbsp;sent home by the world's 150 million international migrants could fall by about 1%. Mexico, the third biggest&nbsp;recipient of migrant remittances in the world, estimated in 2007 it would receive $23.8bn but that this would&nbsp;fall in 2008 by almost 8%. <br>In 2010, a different organisation produced the following table of migrant remittances. <br><strong>Table 1: Money sent home by migrant workers to selected countries (US$ billion)</strong></p>

<li>In Philippine, the high rate of domestic unemployment, possibly due to a prolonged recession, might have&nbsp;resulted in relatively lower wages. Thus in pursuit of better paid jobs the skilled workers might have&nbsp;migrated from the country in large numbers. The migrated workers send money back to their families,&nbsp;which over a period of time, have become substantial foreign receipts for the country and has made its&nbsp;economy increasingly dependent on them.</li>
<li>The table largely contradicts with the information provided in the fifth paragraph. Mexico's forecast, for&nbsp;instance, was $23.8 bn in 2007. The table, however, proves this incorrect as it indicates $26.1 bn. Also,&nbsp;the prediction for Mexico for 2008 was 8% less receipts than 2007, but the figures provided in the table&nbsp;reflect approximately 4%. Overall increase in remittances was predicted 33% in some areas, however in&nbsp;most areas it was not 33%. Furthermore, the World Bank's prediction of a slowing in growth of income&nbsp;sent home in 2008/9 was proved incorrect when compared with the figures given in the table. However&nbsp;the information in the table is limited to only five countries while that of World Bank's is the average&nbsp;of all the recipient countries therefore cannot be confirmed from the information in the table.<br>On the other hand some pieces of information can be matched. Mexico, for instance, is the third iargest&nbsp;recipient of remittances. Also the decline predicted for Mexico particularly proved correct but the amount&nbsp;of fall does not match with the table. <br>Thus to a large extent, the forecast in the last paragraph is not supported by the figures provided in the&nbsp;table .</li>
<li>The countries receiving migrant labour are likely to benefit from the availability of relatively cheaper skilled&nbsp;labour. It may assist them in keeping their costs of production lower that not only will help them in&nbsp;keeping their domestic rate of inflation low but will also result in an improvement in their international&nbsp;competitiveness. At times it may prove significant in increasing domestic output leading to an increase&nbsp;in the growth rate of their GDP.<br>However, the cheap labour availability may substitute the relatively expensive domestic labour leading to&nbsp;an increasing rate of domestic unemployment. Moreover, local industries may lose the initiative to innovate&nbsp;production processes. Thus it may result in slowing down the introduction of more efficient technique&nbsp;of production as firms no longer feel the need to allocate resources for research and development. The&nbsp;real problem for these countries may arise when the migrant workers send their earnings back to their&nbsp;families leading to a worsening of current balance.<br>Thus the recipient country is likely to benefit in many ways, however, accepting workers from other&nbsp;countries is not free of cost.</li>
<li>Outflow of workers from an economy to other countries may have both economic benefits and costs.&nbsp;Firstly, if mostly unemployed and unskilled workers migrate from the country then the overall supply&nbsp;of labour could fall. It may not only decrease the country's rate of unemployment but could also result&nbsp;in higher wages for other domestic workers. Furthermore, the migrated workers may start earning outside&nbsp;the country and then they may send significant amount of money back to their families, resulting in an&nbsp;improvement in the country's current balance.<br>Moreover, the funds received from abroad could help the related families to break the poverty trap and&nbsp;improve their living and social order. Overall an increase in purchasing power of families left behind might&nbsp;increase domestic demand leading to a higher domestic investment and more job opportunities for others.&nbsp;For the economy as a whole, increasing amount of foreign exchange may help the country to import&nbsp;necessary capital needed for growth.<br>However, migration of skilled workers may prove to be costly. In the short run it may lead to a shortage&nbsp;of skilled labour and therefore may reduce the country's output. Also the country does not benefit directly&nbsp;from its investment in human capital. This is because the country's resources have been used to train those&nbsp;workers but obviously their acquired skills will be used outside thus benefits the recipient country. In&nbsp;the long run, however if those workers come back to serve in their home country then the country is likely&nbsp;to benefit from their experience and training abroad.<br>Thus it can be concluded that the outcome for the home country is uncertain as there are both costs and&nbsp;benefits associated with the workers' migration.</li>

The latter is further classified into underdeveloped, undeveloped and newly industrialized economy. Although all of the above mentioned economies are broadly classified as developing economies but differentiated development will exist among them.</p>
<p>Economically advanced and technologically independent countries are classified as developed nations. While developing countries are mainly characterized by low levels of living, high rate of population growth, low income per head and general economic and technological dependence on developed economies.<br>In developing nations general levels of living tend to be very low for the vast majority of people, This is true not only in relation to their counterparts in rich nations but often also in relation to small elite groups within their own societies. These low levels of living are manifested quantitatively and qualitatively in the form of low incomes (poverty), inadequate housing, poor health, limited education, high infant mortality, low life and work expectancies, and in many cases a general sense of malaise and hopelessness. On the other hand in developed economies high levels of living is reflected by high per capita income, mass education, adequate housing and health facilities for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>Primarily developing economies differ from developed economies in their size and composition of GDP. In 2000, GDP of all the nations of the world was valued at more than U.S. $31 trillion, of which almost $25 trillion originated in the economically developed regions and less than $7 trillion was generated in the less developed nations. When one takes account of the distribution of world population, this means that over 90% of the world's income is produced in the economically developed regions by 15% of the world's people. Thus the remaining 85% of the-world's population is living on only one-fifth of total world income.</p>
<p>So far as the composition of GDP is concerned, tertiary sector contributes the largest proportion to GDP in the developed economies followed by secondary and then primary sector. Their manufacturing and construction are geared towards high value products and structures. In contrast to this, most developing economies are oriented toward the production of primary products (agriculture, fuel, forestry, and raw materials) as opposed to secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (service) activities. These primary commodities form their main exports to other nations. Their manufacturing sector comprises of small scale cottage industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the technology in developed economies is extremely advanced. They are now venturing into genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. On the contrary, developing economies lack indigenous technology and therefore import capital equipments from the developed countries.</p>
<p>Developed economies have extensive infrastructure with highly developed means of transportation and communication. The workers in these countries are better trained and more productive due to the higher health standards and high capital-labour ratio. Whereas, developing countries usually have poor infrastructure, old means of transportation and communication, frequently interrupted supplies of power, water and gas. Productivity of workers in these economies is low mainly due to low health standards, poor training and low capital-labour ratio.</p>
<p>Population of developed economies is small relative to their GNP. They also have much lower birth rate and a longer life expectancy. Their population composition is made up of a larger middle and old age group relative to the young. The literacy rate is usually close to 100% if not 100%. In contrast to this, size of the population in developing economies is high relative to their GNP. Due to the high rate of population growth the proportion of young is relatively high than middle and old people, thus the age structure makes a pyramid. Their general literacy rate is low and the proportion of people with higher education is even lower.</p>
<p>When a country attains the status of being developed some of the problems it encounters are similar in nature, although not to the same extent, from those found in developing economies. The fundamental economic problem of scarcity, for instance, remains regardless of the economic status of the economy. Similarly the problem of unemployment, negative externalities, overcrowding and the issue of exploitation of natural resources are common both in developed and developing economies. These problems cannot be completely solved; however, a developed economy is assumed to be in a stronger position to deal with them than a developing economy thus the severity of these problems can be reduced to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems mentioned above, developed&nbsp;economies face economic problems which differ in nature. For instance, being developed means high cost of living and loss of competitiveness in many of its traditional industries.&nbsp;It is for these reasons the developed countries often have to deal with the rising structural unemployment. Thus a developed country faces the difficult task of discovering and developing new industrial avenues that involves heavy expenditure on research and development and retraining of its labour force. This may be difficult, particularly, if the labour force is inflexible and immobile. <br>A major problem arises when the economy starts incurring trade deficit. This is partly due to the higher value of the exchange rate and partly due to the direct relationship between income and preferences of imported goods. This drains the country's reserves and creates unemployment as demand&nbsp;for the local goods falls within the economy and abroad.</p>
<p>Developed countries may also have the problem of changing values of work force who are accustomed to comforts in life. Through the democratic process they vote for welfare. Thus resources and government spending is diverted to current consumption rather than for capital accumulation. This slows down their economic growth.</p>
<p>Finally developed countries face the problem of aging population. The higher standard of health care increases the average life expectancy. Also the change in life style and social values lower the birth rate. Thus the ratio of dependent population rises i.e. a smaller proportion of population works to support a growing aging population. Often the government has little choice but to raise taxes to finance welfare programmes for the rising aging population. At times the government has to borrow for the same reasons. Rising internal&nbsp;and external borrowing has economic bearing because&nbsp;it increases country's debt and tends to slow down the growth rate.</p>
<p>Thus a developed country has as many economic problems as a developing country. However the developed economies face economic problems which differ in extent and in nature from those found in developing economies.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 91</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9221</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>The demand for money refers to the amount of wealth&nbsp;everyone in the economy wishes to hold in the form of&nbsp;money balances. In the Keynesian analysis of the rate&nbsp;of interest, it is not based purely on the demand for new&nbsp;capital goods. In fact, Keynes argued that there are three&nbsp;distinct motives for preferring to hold wealth in the form&nbsp;of money as opposed to holding either non-money financial&nbsp;assets or physical assets.<br><strong><br></strong>The transactions demand for money<br>Individuals need to hold money in order to meet daily&nbsp;transactions such as buying petrol, paying for groceries&nbsp;or purchasing a newspaper. Everyone will hold a certain&nbsp;amount of money since they are normally paid weekly&nbsp;or monthly whereas their expenditure is spread over the&nbsp;whole period. The average amount held for transactions&nbsp;purposes depends upon the level of money income, the&nbsp;price level, the time of the year and the frequency of&nbsp;pay days. In terms of money income, the higher the&nbsp;money income, the more likely the individual is to&nbsp;purchase more goods and services, and therefore require&nbsp;extra transactions balances. If the price level increases&nbsp;the demand for money for transactions purposes will be&nbsp;higher. In the case of the frequency of pay days, the&nbsp;more frequent, the lower the transactions demand for&nbsp;money. <br><strong><br></strong>The precautionary demand for money <br>The demand for money is also based on the desire to&nbsp;provide for the unexpected. The precautionary demand&nbsp;for money allows the individual to cover unforeseen&nbsp;events, such as the car breaking down, a lengthy period&nbsp;off work through illness, or an unexpected redundancy.&nbsp;It is likely to be the case that as the rate of interest&nbsp;increases, the precautionary demand for money will fall&nbsp;as individuals place their money in interest-bearing assets,&nbsp;i.e. the cost of holding money has increased.&nbsp;Money balances held for these two purposes is called&nbsp;active balances (L<sub>1</sub>) i.e. money to be used as a medium&nbsp;of exchange. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ef40e2d3305ce5eb87859726befe34b9" alt="" width="371" height="271"><br><br>The speculative demand for money <br>Speculative demand for money is based on the expectation&nbsp;of making a speculative gain or avoiding a loss.&nbsp;Money balances held for this purpose are called idle&nbsp;balances (L<sub>2</sub>). Keynes outlined the speculative demand&nbsp;for money in terms of the desire to hold money or fixed&nbsp;income bonds. It is important to note that the price of&nbsp;bonds and the rate of interest are inversely related. When&nbsp;the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly high by&nbsp;individuals they will assume that the next move is in a&nbsp;downward direction. As stated, when the rate of interest&nbsp;falls the price of bonds increases and so there are capital&nbsp;gains to be made. This being so, when the rate of interest&nbsp;is high there will be a substantial demand for&nbsp;bonds and hence a low speculative demand to hold&nbsp;money. If, however, the rate of interest is perceived to&nbsp;be unduly low then individuals will assume that the next&nbsp;move is upwards, resulting in a fall in bond prices and,&nbsp;therefore, a capital loss for those who own bonds. If&nbsp;this is the case, the demand for bonds is likely to be&nbsp;low and those owning bonds will be looking to sell them&nbsp;before the price falls. In this situation the speculative&nbsp;demand for money will be high as shown in the graph&nbsp;below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a0da088200faad5ed8343a84e1882820" alt="" width="399" height="247"><br><br>The total demand for money LP is plotted against the&nbsp;rate of interest (r). This is found by the horizontal&nbsp;addition of curves L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ab17211f8d9b2882df4e45e4e8dc6a3c" alt="" width="412" height="219"><br><br>Thus a change in interest rate causes movement upward&nbsp;or downward along the demand for money curve. <br><br>While a change in other determinants such as national&nbsp;income, price level and frequency with which people&nbsp;receive their incomes will result in a shift in the LP&nbsp;function. A rise in national income or price level, for&nbsp;instance will cause L<sub>1</sub>, and thus LP curve to shift to the&nbsp;right and vice versa.</li>
<li>In the money market the condition for monetary equilibrium&nbsp;is that the rate of interest will be such that&nbsp;everyone is just willing to hold the existing supply of&nbsp;money, i.e. interest rate does the job of equating the&nbsp;quantity of money demanded to the available supply&nbsp;and hence produces monetary equilibrium. In the figure&nbsp;below, we see how the interest rate produces monetary&nbsp;equilibrium.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6379cf3d89d9b1494dea8c19497d4e61" alt="" width="348" height="227"><br><br>Equilibrium is achieved with a rate of interest Re and&nbsp;the quantity of money Me. If the rate of interest were&nbsp;above Re, people would have money balances surplus&nbsp;to their needs. They would use these to buy securities&nbsp;and other assets. This would drive up the price of&nbsp;securities and drive down the rate of interest toward&nbsp;equilibrium. Similarly, if the rate of interest were below&nbsp;Re, people would have insufficient money balances. They&nbsp;would sell securities, thus lowering their prices and&nbsp;raising the rate of interest until it reached the equilibrium&nbsp;level.&nbsp;<br><br>An increase in money supply will affect national income&nbsp;via changes in the rate of interest. Let's assume&nbsp;that monetary authorities seek to adopt easy monetary&nbsp;measures and attempt to increase money supply, say,&nbsp;by lowering liquidity ratio of commercial banks or buying&nbsp;securities through open market operation. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/21ba8717f23a54f1189ab33d5a41b8d2" alt="" width="475" height="309"><br><br>These measures shift the supply curve of money from&nbsp;MS to MS<sub>1</sub> as shown in the first part of the graph.&nbsp;Consequently, there is excess supply of money at the&nbsp;existing rate of interest Re. People still wish to hold&nbsp;only Me of money balances, but Me<sub>1</sub> is now available.&nbsp;In order to eliminate their excess holdings of money,&nbsp;people attempt to buy bonds and securities. This attempt&nbsp;of buying bonds or any other financial assets&nbsp;increases their prices and subsequently lowers the rate&nbsp;of interest. When interest has fallen to Re1 the quantity&nbsp;of money demanded will have risen to equal the available&nbsp;supply of Me<sub>1</sub>. Monetary equilibrium is, thus reestablished,&nbsp;though at a lower rate of interest. <br><br>The curve in the other part of the graph is called a&nbsp;marginal efficiency of investment curve (or just a demand&nbsp;for investment curve). MEC curve shows the&nbsp;relation between planned investment and the rate of&nbsp;interest, assuming all other things are equal. It is derived&nbsp;from prospective yield of one more unit of investment&nbsp;and the cost of obtaining it. Firms make their investment&nbsp;decisions by comparing MEC with the rate of&nbsp;interest. If, for instance, the expected real net rate of&nbsp;return on an individual project (MEC) is greater than&nbsp;the real rate of interest, investment is profitable and&nbsp;hence is undertaken. Thus investment demand curve&nbsp;shows that the lower the rate of interest, the larger will&nbsp;be the number of investment opportunities that will&nbsp;show a profit and, hence, the larger the volume of investment&nbsp;expenditure that firms wish to undertake. <br><br>Note that, because both parts, in the above figure, have&nbsp;the interest rate on the vertical axis, the interest rate can&nbsp;be compared between the two parts. Both parts show&nbsp;an initial equilibrium with the quantity of money of Me&nbsp;and an interest rate of Re. But when the equilibrium is&nbsp;disturbed, say due to an increase in the money supply to MS<sub>1</sub>, the rate of interest falls to Re<sub>1</sub>. Part (ii) of the&nbsp;Figure tells us that the fall in the interest rate from Re&nbsp;to Re<sub>1</sub> increases desired investment expenditure from I<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>to I<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br>So far, we have seen that an increase in the money supply&nbsp;leads to a fall in the interest rate which, subsequently&nbsp;results in an increase in desired investment expenditure.&nbsp;However, the extent to which a rise in money supply&nbsp;causes the rate of interest to fall and investment to&nbsp;increase depends on the elasticity of the LP curve and&nbsp;the sensitivity of investment to a change in the rate of&nbsp;interest. If, for instance, economy operates at the horizontal&nbsp;part of LP i.e. liquidity trap, then increase in MS&nbsp;fails to bring a fall in interest rate and hence would not&nbsp;affect planned investment at all. This is illustrated in the&nbsp;graph below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/04fd04a2448ab921890e2933b5554641" alt="" width="397" height="234"><br><br>At very low rate of interest, speculators may expect&nbsp;that the rate of interest cannot fall any further. Thus LP&nbsp;curve becomes horizontal i.e. demand for money is&nbsp;perfectly interest elastic. No one wants to buy bonds&nbsp;when interest rate is so low and is expected to rise in&nbsp;future. Thus if monetary authorities increase MS, this&nbsp;would simply add to speculative balances and the rate&nbsp;of interest would remain unchanged, thus increase in&nbsp;MS is unable to stimulate investment. <br>Similarly a monetary stimulus would fail to achieve the&nbsp;desired results if investment is interest inelastic. Consider&nbsp;the graph below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ed0ebf0d9cfc10faf8c58e04c47c053b" alt="" width="499" height="336"><br>The graph above shows that the extent to which a rise&nbsp;in MS stimulates the level of investment depends on&nbsp;interest elasticity of the investment curve. An interest&nbsp;inelastic investment function (I<sub>1</sub>) would result in a proportionately&nbsp;smaller rise in investment due to a given&nbsp;fall in interest rate. On the contrary, an interest elastic&nbsp;investment function (I<sub>2</sub>) would produce a proportionately&nbsp;larger rise in investment than the given fall in&nbsp;interest rate.&nbsp;<br><br>Thus we conclude that a rise in MS is expected to reduce&nbsp;interest rate and investment to rise. However, the extent&nbsp;of changes in both the interest rate and then investment&nbsp;depends on the elasticity of demand for money and&nbsp;interest sensitivity of investment.</li>

Illustrate&nbsp;your answer with two types of policy from each.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Micro economics looks at specific economic units. It&nbsp;deals with the decision making of individuals and firms,&nbsp;and how a particular market works. Macro economics,&nbsp;on the other hand, focuses on the economy as a whole.&nbsp;It is the study of aggregates such as unemployment,&nbsp;inflation, aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Thus&nbsp;government microeconomic policies operate through particular&nbsp;market while macroeconomic policies focus on&nbsp;changing the variables which affect the aggregates.</p>
<p>First of the two macroeconomic policies is called fiscal&nbsp;policy. It involves the use of government spending,&nbsp;taxation and borrowing to influence both the pattern of&nbsp;economic activity and also the level and growth of&nbsp;aggregate demand, output and employment.</p>
<p>Fiscal policy can be used in various different ways. It&nbsp;may be used to try to boost the level of economic activity&nbsp;when the economy is flagging a little. In this case it is&nbsp;called reflationary policy. Alternatively the economy may&nbsp;be doing a little too well and in need of slowing down.&nbsp;In this case deflationary policy is called for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments may choose to use reflationary fiscal&nbsp;policy in times of recession or a general downturn in&nbsp;economic activity. In this situation they will use their&nbsp;fiscal policy to give a boost to the economy. They may&nbsp;do this by lowering taxes in some form or by increasing&nbsp;the level of government expenditure. This will encourage&nbsp;people to spend more. If they lower indirect taxes then&nbsp;this will lower the prices of the taxed goods and encourage&nbsp;more demand. Alternatively they could lower direct&nbsp;taxes. This will raise people's disposable income (their&nbsp;take-home pay) and therefore encourage them to spend&nbsp;more. Either way the level of demand in the economy&nbsp;should rise and help encourage economic growth.</p>
<p>Deflationary fiscal policy is likely to be most appropriate&nbsp;in times of economic boom. If the economy is&nbsp;growing at above its capacity this is likely to cause&nbsp;inflation and balance of payments problems. To try to&nbsp;slow the economy down the government could either&nbsp;raise taxes in some form or perhaps reduce government&nbsp;expenditure. Either of these will reduce the level of&nbsp;demand in the economy and therefore the level of economic&nbsp;growth.</p>
<p>The second macroeconomic policy is called monetary&nbsp;policy. It is normally interpreted as government induced&nbsp;changes in either the supply of money or interest rate.&nbsp;Changes in money supply and interest rate will affect&nbsp;aggregate demand indirectly. So if the supply of money&nbsp;increases, people will have more spending power and&nbsp;they demand for more goods and services. In other words&nbsp;aggregate demand increases. This will put pressure on&nbsp;suppliers, thus output and hence employment will rise.&nbsp;When the continuous rise in AD produces bottlenecks&nbsp;and prices along with trade deficit rises there is a need&nbsp;to reduce money supply and increase interest rate.&nbsp;Consumer spending in turn is restricted, so there is less&nbsp;danger of the economy overheating and the inflation&nbsp;rate eases out.</p>
<p>The microeconomic goal of economic efficiency provides&nbsp;rationale for competition policy. Competition&nbsp;policy is used to promote efficiency by increasing competition&nbsp;in the market place. The purpose is to protect&nbsp;consumers from high prices and reduced output that&nbsp;result from the exercise of monopoly power. This can&nbsp;be done by influencing either the market structure or&nbsp;the behavior of individual firms. The policy measures&nbsp;range from government assuming the ownership of private&nbsp;monopolies to directly or indirectly regulating their prices&nbsp;and output. Direct regulations involve the government&nbsp;dictating the monopolist to charge a price equal to MC.&nbsp;While indirect measures may take the form of financial&nbsp;intervention or measures to reduce entry barriers.<br>Secondly, the goal of equity gives way to the policy of&nbsp;redistribution of income and wealth. Progressive taxation&nbsp;and income transfers are used by the government&nbsp;as a means of transferring income and wealth from one&nbsp;group in society to another group, for example, from&nbsp;relatively rich people to those who are in poverty. These&nbsp;transfers include security benefits, such as income support,&nbsp;job seekers allowance or a state pension. The&nbsp;justification of this policy is to achieve fairness or equity&nbsp;in the economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 93</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9187</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The market is the fairest means of wage determination.&nbsp;To what extent do you support this opinion?</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. The concept of fair wage&nbsp;is a normative issue therefore involves value judgment.&nbsp;However, according to the economic analysis a fair wage&nbsp;means that the wage rate equals marginal revenue product of&nbsp;labour (MRP<sub>L</sub>). If the wage rate is less than the worker's&nbsp;MRP<sub>L</sub> it will be considered unfair.</p>
<p>In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic&nbsp;theory goes, wage rate is determined by the demand for and&nbsp;supply of labour. Many firms competing with one another&nbsp;in hiring a specific type of labour characterize this type of&nbsp;market. Also, there are numerous qualified workers with&nbsp;identical skills independently supply labour. There exist&nbsp;perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom of entry&nbsp;and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers&nbsp;are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing&nbsp;horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal&nbsp;revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product, MRP<sub>L</sub>, is the increase in revenue due&nbsp;to employing one more unit of labour. MRP<sub>L</sub> is determined&nbsp;by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied&nbsp;by the MR i.e., MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is&nbsp;no union; workers compete individually for available jobs.&nbsp;The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward,&nbsp;indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage&nbsp;rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must&nbsp;bid these workers away from other industries.</p>

<p>In the figure above both equilibrium wage rate and level of&nbsp;employment are determined by the intersection of the market&nbsp;demand and supply curves as depicted in the left part&nbsp;of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to&nbsp;hire this type of labor up to the point at which its marginal&nbsp;revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is equal to marginal cost of labour&nbsp;(MC<sub>L</sub>) shown in the right part of the graph.</p>
<p>Although economic theory of wage determination is primarily&nbsp;concerned with a perfectly competitive market, however,&nbsp;the theory could be extended to allow various market&nbsp;imperfections, which exist in real world. For instance, there&nbsp;may be a single buyer of labour - a 'monopsonist' - where&nbsp;a large factory is the main source of employment in a locality.&nbsp;If this is the case, then the wage rate, (AC<sub>L</sub>) is no longer&nbsp;represented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the wage&nbsp;rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence, monopsonist&nbsp;will be facing upward sloping market supply curve&nbsp;and in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a&nbsp;higher wage rate. In such a case, the size of an employer's&nbsp;demand for labour will affect the wage rate. This is illustrated&nbsp;in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/3060f2075d57d134994d49a747f5fedf" alt="" width="392" height="224"></p>
<p>The marginal cost curve for labour (MC<sub>L</sub> ) being above the&nbsp;average cost curve for labour (AC<sub>L</sub>) can be explained by the&nbsp;use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £ 100, 50 workers&nbsp;may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to&nbsp;employ one more worker he or is forced to offer £ 101, the&nbsp;increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now £101 but the marginal cost is £151, comprising of £101 paid&nbsp;to the 51st worker plus £1 paid to each of the 50 original&nbsp;workers.&nbsp;<br>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ&nbsp;where the MC<sub>L</sub> is equal to the MRP<sub>L</sub>, i.e. point A, hence&nbsp;L<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>workers will be employed. The wage rate, however, is&nbsp;given by the average cost curve S (AC<sub>L</sub>) and this will be W<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;The overall wage bill to the monopsonist will, therefore, be&nbsp;OW<sub>1</sub>BL<sub>1</sub>. This will allow the monopsonist to make larger&nbsp;profits, while at the same time workers are getting less than&nbsp;the MRP<sub>L</sub>. Economists refer to this as a form of exploitation&nbsp;and an unfair wage rate because the wage rate is less than&nbsp;the last worker's MRP. In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony&nbsp;market the wage and numbers being employed&nbsp;would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. Thus the wage rate&nbsp;determined by the market forces is considered fair because&nbsp;wage rate equals the last worker's MRP. Thus monopsony&nbsp;power in a labour market will result in a lower level of&nbsp;employment and an unfair wage rate than would exist in a&nbsp;competitive labour market.</p>
<p>However, this comparative lower wage rate and employment&nbsp;can be corrected by incorporating trade unions or government.<br>Trade unions seek to increase the wage rate of their members&nbsp;by either restricting the supply of labour (explained in part&nbsp;a) or by direct negotiation. Collective bargaining involves&nbsp;wage negotiation between trade unions, acting on behalf of&nbsp;their members, and the employers. Successful bargaining could&nbsp;raise the wage rate, as shown&nbsp;in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f84f26cdc2444d1a70e756f009040787" alt="" width="377" height="261"></p>
<p>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in the&nbsp;industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and restrict&nbsp;employment L<sub>1</sub>. The entry of a trade union to the industry,&nbsp;which sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, will kink the supply&nbsp;curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal&nbsp;cost curve of labour. <br>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra workers&nbsp;so long as the marginal revenue product of labour is greater&nbsp;than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the workers&nbsp;get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually&nbsp;employs more workers. It is only when the union forces the&nbsp;wage rate above W<sub>3</sub> that employment starts to fall. Minimum&nbsp;wage fixed by the government will also produce the&nbsp;same result in an imperfect market. However, the effect of&nbsp;minimum wage fixed above the equilibrium wage rate in a&nbsp;perfectly competitive labour market is likely to increase&nbsp;unemployment therefore, it can worsen the situation for those&nbsp;who lose their jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus a comparison of perfect and imperfect market suggests&nbsp;that the wage rate fixed in a perfectly competitive market is&nbsp;fair because W = MRP<sub>L</sub>. However, the wage rate determined&nbsp;in an imperfectly market is viewed as unfair because MRP<sub>L&nbsp;</sub>is higher than W. There is therefore a role for the trade unions&nbsp;and government to increase the wage rate to the level considered&nbsp;fair i.e. W = MRP<sub>L</sub>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 94</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9177</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Economic theory states that large firms have lower average&nbsp;costs than small firms.&nbsp;Discuss whether this statement is necessarily true.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>There are a number of reasons for a firm to wish to&nbsp;become large. In most cases firms target to reduce their&nbsp;average costs by taking advantage of economies of scale.&nbsp;Economies of scale have the effect of increasing the&nbsp;productive capacity of the business and give a business&nbsp;a competitive edge in domestic and international markets.&nbsp;In other cases firms may wish to become large to&nbsp;increase their market dominance thereby giving them&nbsp;increased pricing power in specific markets. Monopolies for example can engage in price discrimination. Also&nbsp;the expansion of a business might be motivated by a&nbsp;desire to diversify production and sales so that falling&nbsp;sales in one market might be compensated by healthier&nbsp;demand and output in another market.</p>
<p>Whatever motivates a firm to increase its size of production,&nbsp;the impact can be explained on the firm's long&nbsp;run average cost curve. A long run average cost curve&nbsp;(LRAC) shows how per unit cost varies with output on&nbsp;the assumption that the least cost method of production&nbsp;will be chosen for each level of output. If the firm&nbsp;experiences economies of scale its LRAC curve will fall&nbsp;but if diseconomies of scale predominate, the LRAC&nbsp;curve will rise. If the firm experiences neither of them,&nbsp;the LRAC curve will be horizontal as shown in the&nbsp;figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8756db27523e4b092e6dcad90a567095" alt="" width="450" height="254"><br><br>In the figure above, initially an expansion of output over&nbsp;time leads to a reduction in the unit costs. These cost&nbsp;saving benefits are referred to as economies of scale.&nbsp;They occur because initially the firm's output rises&nbsp;proportionately faster than the inputs. These benefits&nbsp;come in a variety of ways known as technical, marketing,&nbsp;financial, managerial and risk bearing economies.</p>
<p>Firstly the firm gains from technical economies. As a&nbsp;firm grows in size it may be able to take advantage of&nbsp;increased specialisation. If the firm produces only a small&nbsp;output it may not be possible to employ a worker solely&nbsp;on one process but as the level of production increases&nbsp;workers may be able to specialise, leading to a lowering&nbsp;of the firm's costs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the firm can reduce its per unit costs through&nbsp;what is known as increased dimensions. For example, if&nbsp;the size of a container is doubled its surface area is&nbsp;increased 4 fold and its volume is increased 8 fold. It&nbsp;is possible, therefore, to obtain cost savings by making&nbsp;use of larger containers, say, for the storage or distribution&nbsp;of finished products since the cost per unit will fall.&nbsp;A large firm may also devote proportionately more&nbsp;resources to research and development which could lead&nbsp;to an improvement in the quality of the goods and&nbsp;services produced, and possibly to a lowering of the&nbsp;cost per unit.</p>
<p>Firm also gains on marketing its products. For instance,&nbsp;when a firm buys its raw materials in bulk it may obtain&nbsp;preferential terms in the form of a discount, thus reducing&nbsp;the cost of each unit. A large firm may employ&nbsp;specialist buyers whose sole responsibility it is to&nbsp;purchase raw materials at the cheapest price. Administration,&nbsp;advertising, and packaging costs may also be&nbsp;lower for larger companies since they can spread the&nbsp;cost over larger orders. For example, the packaging costs&nbsp;per item for 1 million units is likely to be substantially&nbsp;lower than if 100 items were packaged.</p>
<p>On the financial front larger firms may be able to obtain&nbsp;finance on favourable terms, obtaining loans from financial&nbsp;institutions at lower rates of interest. Banks will be&nbsp;more willing to give loan on preferential terms to a large,&nbsp;well-known company, which can offer more collateral as&nbsp;security for the loan, than it will to a smaller company!</p>
<p>In addition the large firms normally produce more than&nbsp;one product and therefore take advantage of economies&nbsp;of scope. Economies of scope refer to the reduction in&nbsp;average total cost (ATC) made possible by a firm increasing&nbsp;the number of different goods it produces. The&nbsp;reason is that the firm is able to take advantage of skilled&nbsp;staff and technology which can be shared by the di fferent&nbsp;goods produced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, with the firm experiencing&nbsp;diseconomies of scale its average costs may increase.&nbsp;These diseconomies of scale also come in a variety of&nbsp;different ways. For instance, as a firm grows beyond a&nbsp;certain size it will possibly have a larger management&nbsp;team and, unlike a small firm, it will find it difficult to&nbsp;make decisions quickly. This can often be the case where&nbsp;companies have merged and there are two sets of management&nbsp;with different ideas. It may be difficult to&nbsp;coordinate planning, marketing, production and so on,&nbsp;with a resulting increase in the company's cost per unit.</p>
<p>Moreover, the workforce may feel remote and alienated&nbsp;from the management. They may find their jobs boring&nbsp;and repetitive, particularly if mass production methods&nbsp;are used, and this may result in low morale and poor&nbsp;motivation. There may be a feeling on the part of the&nbsp;workforce that they are not part of the firm and this&nbsp;may lead to deterioration in the quality of work undertaken.&nbsp;A 'them and us' situation may also develop between&nbsp;the management and the workforce, possibly&nbsp;resulting in an increase in the number of industrial disputes.</p>
<p>Thus, from the above discussion it seems obvious to&nbsp;conclude that large firms do not necessarily produce at&nbsp;a lower per unit cost. Rather as the firm grows beyond&nbsp;a certain size its per unit costs might be higher than the&nbsp;other relatively small firms in the same industry.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 95</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9173</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Consider whether small firms should be encouraged in&nbsp;an economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>It is incontestable that nowadays, firms that operate on&nbsp;a large scale and can thereby maximise the potential of&nbsp;economies of scale and scope. However, economic realities&nbsp;also mean that amidst the big firms there are small&nbsp;businesses competing in the same markets and industries.</p>
<p>One cannot ignore the impact of specialisation and quality.&nbsp;While firms that exploit economies of scale and can&nbsp;become major players in an industry as a whole, there&nbsp;is always room for countless small firms to find a niche&nbsp;in which they can perform better than any other firm,&nbsp;including the biggest ones. A great example of this is in&nbsp;the financial services industry. There are several large&nbsp;players - Citigroup, AIG, Bank of America, HSBC,&nbsp;Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan to name a few - however&nbsp;there also exist myriad small businesses that have a niche&nbsp;in which they can perform better than anyone else.</p>
<p>In other cases firms usually continue to operate at relatively&nbsp;smaller scale where the markets have been confined&nbsp;to fairly small regions. Thus small firms are useful&nbsp;in satisfying market demand where the absolute size of&nbsp;the market is small.</p>
<p>A more general advantage of small firms is that, while&nbsp;costs may fall for standardized goods, there is often a&nbsp;demand for variety, which can involve large firms in&nbsp;exceptionally high costs. This allows small flexible firms&nbsp;producing a few differentiated products to survive.</p>
<p>More often small firms are attributed with product innovation&nbsp;and introduction of new products and ideas.&nbsp;At the early stage of a new product, total demand is&nbsp;typically low, costs of production are high and many&nbsp;small firms try to get ahead of their competitors by&nbsp;finding the twist that appeals to consumers or the technique&nbsp;that slashes their costs.</p>
<p>In certain industries, such as restaurants and beauty&nbsp;parlors, personal services are required due to the variation&nbsp;in the customers' requirements. It is not feasible for&nbsp;larger firms to ·provide that kind of attention to the&nbsp;individual buyers.</p>
<p>Some small firms exist because they supply standardized&nbsp;parts to a large firm. The costs of components in&nbsp;certain industries may rise sharply as output increases,&nbsp;giving advantage to small size.</p>
<p>In addition encouraging small businesses is viewed as&nbsp;part of the government policies to reduce unemployment.&nbsp;Governments around the world support small firms&nbsp;because they not only create employment but also&nbsp;provide necessary competition to large firms. Governments adopt various measures to assist small firms such&nbsp;as financial and technical support and most importantly&nbsp;tax rebates.</p>
<p>Thus small firms, so the theory goes, operate in those&nbsp;industries, which provide personal services, produce expensive&nbsp;luxury items and satisfy demand for variety&nbsp;products.</p>
<p>However having small firms can prove disadvantageous&nbsp;in certain industries. Particularly in industries where substantial&nbsp;economies of scale exist, large firms are preferable&nbsp;because they can benefit from economies of scale&nbsp;and pass on the cost advantages to the buyers in the&nbsp;form of lower prices. If the firms in such industries&nbsp;remain relatively small they cannot benefit fully from&nbsp;the economies of scale and thus produce at a higher per&nbsp;unit cost and deny the consumers from the possibility&nbsp;of lower prices. It is particularly important if the country&nbsp;is looking to sell its products internationally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, small firms usually do not have the capacity&nbsp;and finances available for research and development.&nbsp;Industries such as pharmaceuticals and engineering need&nbsp;to invest heavily in research and development in order&nbsp;to develop new products and production processes.&nbsp;There is, therefore, a need to have relatively large firms&nbsp;with enough finances to afford the much needed research&nbsp;and development.</p>
<p>Thus it follows that small firms should be encouraged&nbsp;because not only they fill the spaces in the market left&nbsp;by large firms but they also provide necessary competition&nbsp;to large firms and in many cases help the authorities&nbsp;to keep the level of unemployment low. However&nbsp;in particular cases the existing small businesses should&nbsp;be encouraged to grow big and gain from possible large&nbsp;scale cost advantages.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 96</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9171</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Analyse what is meant by economic efficiency and assess&nbsp;whether efficiency is always achieved in a market.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Efficiency generally relates to how well an economy&nbsp;uses its scarce resources to satisfy maximum wants of&nbsp;consumers. When economists use the term efficiency&nbsp;they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency.&nbsp;An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when&nbsp;right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce&nbsp;right products. In other words allocative efficiency&nbsp;occurs when the consumer valuation equals the cost of&nbsp;the resources (marginal cost) used up in production of&nbsp;a product. Thus the condition required for allocative&nbsp;efficiency is price = marginal cost. When this happens&nbsp;economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and&nbsp;producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates&nbsp;allocative efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f4888f72ca34d6e3a680e3e8a27af383" alt="" width="242" height="180"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS,&nbsp;producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium&nbsp;in the market implies P = MC, hence, generating maximum&nbsp;possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus.&nbsp;Situations where either P &gt; MC or P &lt; MC imply&nbsp;inefficient allocation of resources as illustrated in the&nbsp;graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c5cbe3da0ec5f20acb2ce29d99374658" alt="" width="346" height="220"></p>
<p>At the level of output of 100,000 units, P &gt; MC. It&nbsp;indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than&nbsp;what are required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC.&nbsp;Thus each additional unit up to 200,000 would increase&nbsp;both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle&nbsp;A, hence would improve allocative efficiency. On&nbsp;the other hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources&nbsp;have been allocated for the production of this product.&nbsp;In the graph above the production of 300,000 units would&nbsp;represent an over-allocation of resources. Hence the&nbsp;shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of&nbsp;consumer and producer surplus from the alternative&nbsp;product. Therefore net gains can be realized until production&nbsp;can be reduced to 200,000 units.</p>
<p>Hence resources are being efficiently allocated to any&nbsp;product when its output is such that its price equals&nbsp;marginal cost.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production&nbsp;and can be applied both to the short run and long run.&nbsp;Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize the&nbsp;wastage of resources i.e. when they produce a product&nbsp;using the least possible resources or generating the lowest&nbsp;possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/00b011321f3567e1b4dc2dce825174c5" alt="" width="303" height="207"></p>
<p>In the figure above AC<sub>3</sub> indicates productive efficiency.&nbsp;This means that the lowest possible cost techniques of&nbsp;production are being used to produce different level of&nbsp;output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per&nbsp;unit cost hence represent productive inefficiency. The&nbsp;firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when&nbsp;production occurs at the lowest point indicated by point&nbsp;z on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the&nbsp;term technical efficiency for this point.</p>
<p>Market forces do all the good things that we have discussed;&nbsp;yet there are many situations in which these&nbsp;forces do not produce the best outcomes. In these cases&nbsp;we say that markets have failed.</p>
<p>Market failure exists when the competitive outcome of&nbsp;markets is not efficient from the point of view of society&nbsp;as a whole. The result is a loss of economic and&nbsp;social welfare. This is usually because the benefits that&nbsp;the free-market confers on individuals or businesses&nbsp;carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits&nbsp;to the society as a whole.</p>
<p>The first of these situations occurs when firms facing&nbsp;downward sloping demand curves - whether a monopoly&nbsp;or firms in an imperfect market - will maximize profits&nbsp;at an output where price exceeds marginal cost, hence&nbsp;leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources.&nbsp;This is shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/7c8d498ad273c331f7ecf9d8317cbc9a" alt="" width="352" height="209"></p>
<p>Under perfect competition the price is determined by&nbsp;market demand and supply forces, hence P<sub>P</sub> is the market&nbsp;price and the industry will sell Q<sub>P</sub> output. The industry&nbsp;is said to achieve allocative efficiency because P = MC.&nbsp;On the other hand a monopolist, for instance, will produce&nbsp;where MC= MR. Thus it produces Q<sub>M</sub> output and&nbsp;will sell this at P<sub>m&nbsp;</sub>price. Clearly the monopolist produces&nbsp;where MC &lt; P, hence monopoly results in a loss&nbsp;of consumer and producer surplus shown by the triangular&nbsp;area 3 + 5. Also lack of competition reduces welfare&nbsp;of consumers because they have a little choice available.&nbsp;So, overall society will be worse off.</p>
<p>Besides imperfect markets, the existence of externalities&nbsp;also causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at&nbsp;socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever&nbsp;actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer&nbsp;benefits on others that are not involved in the transaction.&nbsp;The essence of the problem created by externalities is that&nbsp;market forces will lead to either too little or too much&nbsp;production. With a positive externality, a competitive free&nbsp;market will produce too little of the good and with a&nbsp;negative externality it produces too much of the good.&nbsp;Thus the presence of externalities, even when all markets&nbsp;are perfectly competitive, leads to allocatively&nbsp;inefficient outcomes.</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect&nbsp;information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction&nbsp;can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto&nbsp;the other party. The other party loses because they do not have the same information. More generally, whenever&nbsp;either party to a transaction lacks information that&nbsp;the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the&nbsp;outcome of market forces changes and these changes&nbsp;may lead to inefficiency.</p>
<p>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect&nbsp;information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how&nbsp;good or bad a particular product is for them: either they&nbsp;do not have the right information or they simply lack&nbsp;some relevant information. The problem is that their&nbsp;existence will cause market forces to lead to an inappropriate&nbsp;amount of the product being produced or consumed.</p>
<p>In addition if markets are to work with full efficiency,&nbsp;then labour markets also must function well. Only if&nbsp;labour is fully mobile will labour markets function efficiently.&nbsp;The problem is that labour is often geographically&nbsp;and occupationally immobile. Therefore there&nbsp;persists a mismatch between demand and supply of&nbsp;labour in various occupations and in different regions.&nbsp;This results in further examples of market failures.</p>
<p>From the above we conclude that markets do not necessarily&nbsp;always achieve efficiency.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 97</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9159</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A comparison of the Japanese and UK economies</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the start of 2009, Japan's economy had suffered its worse contraction for over 50 years. The world's&nbsp;second-largest economy saw a fall of 15.2% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2008 and 2009.&nbsp;Japan's economy is dependent on exports, which fell by a record 26% in the last quarter of 2008, forcing&nbsp;companies to cut production as they had much spare capacity. Business investment declined by 10.4% during&nbsp;2008. Weaker domestic consumer demand was also a cause in the fall of GDP in 2008 but this declined by&nbsp;only 1.1 %, much less than business investment demand. However, by March 2009 industrial production&nbsp;started to increase and there were hopes that the economy would start to grow again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the UK, between 2008 and 2009, GDP fell by 5.7%. It was thought that it would take some time to&nbsp;reverse the recession. Export orders continued to decline sharply and this, an industry leader said, 'is a&nbsp;particular concern as we are not seeing much of a boom in exports from the weakness of sterling'.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also,&nbsp;manufacturers had cut costs, reduced the number of people employed and experienced reduced profits.&nbsp;However, they still had excess stocks and it was not thought likely that investment would increase quickly.&nbsp;Consumer spending declined as consumers were unsure of the future. With rising unemployment, likely tax&nbsp;increases and a lack of credit facilities from the banks, the decrease in spending was hardly surprising. The&nbsp;inability of consumers to obtain credit caused a decline in house building, which had further negative effects&nbsp;on employment in the construction industry.</p>

<li>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within&nbsp;a country in one year time period. The term 'gross' indicates that depreciation of capital is still to be&nbsp;accounted for and the term 'domestic output' includes goods and services produced by citizen-supplied&nbsp;and foreign-supplied resources within a particular nation's geographical boundaries. Real GDP figure is an&nbsp;important variable for it indicates growth in an economy. Economists use real GDP figures as a benchmark&nbsp;to compare an economy's performance with other economies. Government uses GDP figure firstly to&nbsp;assess the effectiveness of its current economic policies and secondly to introduce necessary changes in&nbsp;future economic plans.</li>
<li>At the start of 2005 Japan's GDP had zero growth but that of UK was over 2%. Both countries then&nbsp;had a rise in GDP growth. Overall between 2005-2008 UK's GDP had grown consistently within a band&nbsp;of 1 % to 2% with relatively mild fluctuations, while growth rate of Japan's GDP changed within a band&nbsp;of 5% with relatively sharp fluctuations. However, Japan's GDP fell to a lower level than the UK at the&nbsp;end of 2008. There was somewhat a similar pattern of decline but Japan's decline of 15.2% remained worse&nbsp;than 5. 7% of the UK.</li>
<li>The concern is that the low value of sterling failed to boost enough demand for UK's exports. Instead&nbsp;there was a sharp decline in export orders. Generally, a weaker currency makes the country's exports to&nbsp;become relatively cheaper and therefore demand for the country's exports is expected to rise. But the effect&nbsp;on earnings from exports depends on the price elasticity of demand. If demand for a country's exports&nbsp;is price elastic then depreciation in the exchange rate increases its export earnings. This is because the&nbsp;proportionate rise in QD is larger than the given proportionate fall in prices of exports. On the contrary,&nbsp;if demand for a country's exports is relatively price inelastic then the earnings from exports decline because&nbsp;the proportionate rise in QD is outweighed by a proportionately larger fall in prices of exports.<br><br>In the UK it was expected that the weaker sterling would help to increase demand for UK's exports by&nbsp;a larger proportion, which in tum would generate income and employment as the UK's economy partly&nbsp;depends on exports. But the world wide recession possibly had a bigger effect on the UK's exports than&nbsp;the weak sterling.</li>
<li>The events resulted in changes in GDP of Japan and the UK were somewhat similar in nature but possibly&nbsp;not similar in their intensity. Firstly, both the economies suffered from a fall in consumer spending.&nbsp;Consumer spending fell by 1.1% in Japan, however no comparative figures for UK is mentioned but it&nbsp;is stated that consumer spending fell in the UK.<br><br>In both economies there was excess capacity in businesses that resulted in a fall in business investment.&nbsp;Again no comparative figure used for the UK against a 10.4% decline in investment in Japan. Generally&nbsp;both consumption and investment largely depend on expectations. It seems that people and businesses&nbsp;in both countries shared the same negative sentiments.<br><br>Likewise both countries are hit by the world recession and had their exports declining. Low business&nbsp;confidence and declining exports had given way to a rise in unemployment in both Japan and the UK.<br><br>However, some part of the given information indicate that the two countries differ in their source of&nbsp;changes in growth of their GDP. Japan depended more on exports which fell by a record 26% in the last&nbsp;quarter of 2008. While a greater emphasis was placed on the housing market in the UK coupled with&nbsp;expectations of likely higher taxes and lack of credit facilities from the banks.<br><br>Thus the events which caused changes in GDP in both countries are somewhat similar; however the&nbsp;intensity of events and the extent of changes in GDP are different. A particular difference between the&nbsp;two can be identified in terms of Japan depending more on exports while a greater emphasis is placed&nbsp;on housing in the UK.</li>

It is based on the theme that market forces&nbsp;of demand and supply are a very effective mechanism&nbsp;for coordinating decisions of millions of consumers and&nbsp;produces. The essence of market forces is that the price&nbsp;is determined where demand equals supply and thus&nbsp;resources are allocated in the optimal manner. That is,&nbsp;prices would equal marginal cost for all products, a&nbsp;necessary condition for allocative efficiency. Also firms&nbsp;keep production costs as low as possible to obtain highest&nbsp;profit margin hence, productive efficiency will occur.&nbsp;Such results, however, can only be obtained with perfect&nbsp;markets and perfect information.<br>Market forces do all the good things that we have discussed;&nbsp;yet there are many situations in which these&nbsp;forces do not produce the best outcomes. In these cases&nbsp;we say that markets have failed.<br>Market failure exists when the competitive outcome of&nbsp;markets is not efficient from the point of view of society&nbsp;as a whole. The result is a loss of economic and&nbsp;social welfare. This is usually because the benefits that&nbsp;the free market confers on individuals or businesses&nbsp;carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits&nbsp;to the society as a whole.<br>The first of these situations occurs when firms facing&nbsp;downward sloping demand curves attempts to maximize&nbsp;profits and produces an output where price exceeds&nbsp;marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation&nbsp;of scarce resources. This is shown in the graph below:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/29c0bd18303495e13a0a2012cce6bd78" alt="" width="371" height="224"><br>Under perfect competition the price is determined by&nbsp;market demand and supply forces, hence Pp is the market&nbsp;price and the industry will sell Qp output. The industry&nbsp;is said to achieve allocative efficiency because P = MC.&nbsp;On the other hand a monopolist, for instance, will produce&nbsp;where MC = MR. Thus it produces Qm output and will&nbsp;sell this at Pm price. Clearly the monopolist produces&nbsp;where MC &lt; P, hence inefficient allocation of resources.&nbsp;Thus the firm with market power uses fewer resources&nbsp;and produces less output than the perfectly competitive&nbsp;industry. Also this lack of competition reduces welfare&nbsp;of consumers because they have a little choice available.&nbsp;Besides this, monopoly has resulted in a loss of total&nbsp;surplus of areas 3+5. This is known as deadweight loss&nbsp;of monopoly and reduces the welfare of the whole&nbsp;society.<br>Apart from imperfect markets, the existence of externalities&nbsp;also causes market forces to fail to allocate&nbsp;resource at socially optimum level. An externality&nbsp;occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose&nbsp;costs or confer benefits on others that are not involved&nbsp;in the transaction. The essence of the problem created&nbsp;by externalities is that market forces will lead to either&nbsp;too little or too much production. With a positive externality,&nbsp;a competitive free market will produce too&nbsp;little of the good and with a negative externality it&nbsp;produces too much of the good. Thus the presence of&nbsp;externalities, even when all markets are perfectly competitive,&nbsp;leads to allocatively inefficient outcomes.<br>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect&nbsp;information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction&nbsp;can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto&nbsp;the other party. The other party loses because they do&nbsp;not have the same information. More generally, whenever&nbsp;either party to a transaction lacks information that&nbsp;the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the&nbsp;outcome of market forces changes and these changes&nbsp;may lead to inefficiency.<br>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect&nbsp;information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how&nbsp;good or bad a particular product is for them: either they&nbsp;do not have the right information or they simply lack&nbsp;some relevant information. The problem is that their&nbsp;existence will cause market forces to lead to an inappropriate&nbsp;amount of the product being produced or consumed.&nbsp;In this case as well the producers usually have&nbsp;more information of the effects than consumers therefore&nbsp;consumer are usually seen to make inappropriate&nbsp;consumption, thus they lose.&nbsp;<br>The role of the government is to intervene in markets&nbsp;that are not seen to be allocating resources in the most&nbsp;efficient manner. Government policy and methods of&nbsp;intervention can be summarized under four broad headings:&nbsp;regulation, financial intervention, direct provision&nbsp;and improving information. The method chosen will&nbsp;depend to a large extent on its effectiveness under the&nbsp;given circumstances. Legal and other methods are used&nbsp;to control the quality and quantity of goods and services&nbsp;that are under and over produced by the market&nbsp;forces. <br>Financial intervention means the use of indirect tax and&nbsp;subsidy to achieve optimum allocation of resources. Indirect&nbsp;taxes such as changes in VAT and excise duties&nbsp;can be used to raise the price of demerit goods and&nbsp;products with negative externalities. Subsidies to consumers&nbsp;will lower the price of merit goods such as grants&nbsp;to students to reduce the internal costs of staying on in&nbsp;full-time education. In addition to providing the finance&nbsp;it is also possible for a government to take over the&nbsp;production of a good or service, either in whole or in&nbsp;part. State-owned industries are often referred to as nationalized&nbsp;industries such as the electricity, coal mining&nbsp;and railway industries are entirely owned and managed&nbsp;by the state in many countries. It is also very common&nbsp;to find some goods and services being produced by both&nbsp;the state and the private sectors. Education and health&nbsp;care are particularly good examples of these types of&nbsp;service. <br>Government action can have a role in improving information&nbsp;to help consumers and producers value the 'true'&nbsp;cost and/or benefit of a good or service. <br>Thus a failure of the free market mechanism to deliver&nbsp;an allocatively efficient allocation of scarce resources is&nbsp;normally regarded as justification for some form of&nbsp;government intervention in the economy. This intervention&nbsp;is designed to correct for instances of market failure&nbsp;and achieve an improvement in economic and social&nbsp;welfare.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 99</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9154</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Economic analysis states that the aims of the government&nbsp;include economic growth and economic efficiency.</p>
<p>Explain how achieving economic growth might conflict&nbsp;with other government macroeconomic aims.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Traditionally, main macro economic aims of government policy can be seen as the achievement of full employment, price stability, economic growth and a balance of payment equilibrium. In addition to these governments also aim at achieving high degree of efficiency in the use of nation's scarce resources and a fairly acceptable level of distribution of income and wealth. Though not all governments will share these objectives, yet it is also&nbsp;true that there will be trade-offs and potential conflicts between the objectives, and different governments will attach differing priorities to them.</p>
<p>Economic growth is a measure of rate of change of real GDP over a period of time. High rate of growth can be achieved by bringing unemployed resources at work or alternatively, by improving productivity of existing resources. Governments seek to achieve high but sustainable growth rate mainly because it leads to improved living standards and economic stability.</p>
<p>However, there exists conflict and therefore potential trade-off between growth and a number of other important aims of government such as price stability, a favorable&nbsp;trade balance, conservation of resources and environment&nbsp;and fair distribution of income.</p>
<p>Growth and low inflation have always been important. Without growth, peoples' standard of living will not increase, and if inflation is too high then the value of money falls negating any increase in living standards. Hence, these two variables present a classic conflict in economic theory because they have, in theory, an inverse relationship. If a government tries to increase the growth rate through reflationary measures, such as lower interest rates or increased public spending, then the resulting reduction in unemployment will push wages higher, as employers try to attract workers from a diminishing pool of the unemployed. This will lead to higher prices. On the other hand, when the government tries to control high inflation with higher interest rates and reduced spending, the resulting reduced consumer spending and lower investment will result in job losses and negative growth.</p>
<p>Although it is considered that growth and employment do not conflict and therefore can be achieved as a pair but there could be a conflict between economic growth and unemployment particularly if growth was attained by substituting capital for labour.</p>
<p>Another trade-off can be viewed between growth and trade balance. When an economy is growing quickly, consumer spending tends to be high. As we have seen in many cases consumers tend to buy goods from abroad in preference to home produced goods. Hence, import growth picks up relative to exports, leading to a worsening trade deficit. In order to eliminate trade deficit government could deflate the economy by increasing taxes or reducing government spending. The subsequent reduction in consumer spending will reduce the number of imports bought, but reduced consumption leads to a lower standard of living and a lower rate of economic growth.</p>
<p>Furthermore it can be argued that growth and economic prosperity does not come risk free. In other words higher production cannot be separated from its environmental impact. Quite simply, the faster the rate of growth, the higher the level of production, and so the level of pollution from factories, cars etc. rises. Also, vital rain forests tend to disappear, not just because we consume the wood; new factories, towns and housing are built on the resulting land. Thus the objective of high growth rate may cause depletion of both renewable and nonrenewable scarce resources. On the other hand policies to conserve resources and to minimize environmental damage may limit growth. Of course, not everyone would consider the environment a 'minor' objective, but unfortunately governments around the world have not quite acknowledged the costs inflicted on their societies in their pursuit of high growth rate.</p>
<p>Fair distribution of income is another important objective of governments. However, when it comes to growth economists talk about the 'trickle down' effect. As an economy grows the poor may well get a smaller slice of the cake, but the cake gets so large that the poor man still gets more cake. Of course this does overlook the fact that the rich man is getting a larger slice of a bigger cake. The fact is that high growth rate benefits the owners of inputs who receive significantly larger share of the cake of national income and provides them with better life chances than their retired, unemployed, disabled and underprivileged counterparts unless state welfare payments are generous.</p>
<p>The developed world has grown hugely since the Second World War, but even with the creation of welfare states it is the wealth creators that have benefited hugely whilst those at the bottom of the pile have seen their standard of living just plod along.</p>
<p>Thus we conclude that pursuit of growth is subject to conflict with a number of micro and macro economic&nbsp;policy objectives.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 100</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9151</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what is meant by an equilibrium level of national&nbsp;income and discuss why this equilibrium might change in a&nbsp;developing country.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>National income (NY) is the total income earned by residents&nbsp;of a country after deducting capital consumption. Equilibrium&nbsp;refers to a situation where there is no further tendency&nbsp;for national income to change. The Keynesian theory of&nbsp;income determination outlines two approaches: income-expenditure&nbsp;and leakages-injections in order to explain NY&nbsp;equilibrium.<br>According to the income expenditure approach the level of&nbsp;real national income and, thus, employment is determined by&nbsp;the level of planned aggregate expenditure in an economy.&nbsp;Assuming an open economy with government the total&nbsp;planned expenditures on goods and services comprises of&nbsp;consumer spending (C), investment expenditure by firms on&nbsp;investment goods (I), planned government expenditure on&nbsp;goods and services (G), exports (X) relating to foreigners&nbsp;demanding an economy's goods and services minus imports&nbsp;(M) which represents the demand for goods and services&nbsp;from abroad. Thus: AE = C + I + G + X - M.<br>There is only one level of national income where&nbsp; aggregate&nbsp;expenditure equals the total value of goods and services&nbsp;produced and this is called the equilibrium level of national&nbsp;income. When the economy reaches this point there is no&nbsp;more tendency for national income to change. According to&nbsp;Keynes this may not, however, be the full employment level&nbsp;of national income.<br>The leakages-injections approach is an alternative method&nbsp;of expressing the equilibrium level of national income.&nbsp;Using this approach the equilibrium is where: <br>S + T + M = I + G + X <br>Leakages are classified as withdrawal from the circular flow.&nbsp;On the left side of the equation savings (S) + taxes (T) +&nbsp;imports (M) represent sum of withdrawals (W). On the right side&nbsp;investment (I) + government expenditures (G) + exports (X)&nbsp;represent injections (J) into the circular flow. National income&nbsp;equilibrium is said to achieve when total amount of&nbsp;leakages equals the total amount of injections. The two&nbsp;approaches can be shown on a Keynesian cross diagram. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8febd528b3c89c6697e6a92862efa577" alt="" width="440" height="419"><br>The first of the two graphs shows that NY equilibrium occurs&nbsp;at point e. The graph just below shows NY &nbsp;equilibrium where W = J. However a situation where Y is&nbsp;not equal to E or W is not equal to J is called disequilibrium.&nbsp;For instance at y<sub>1</sub> planned expenditure exceed the level of&nbsp;output. In this situation there may be shortages of goods and&nbsp;services. Alternatively, stocks of goods already produced may&nbsp;be run down. In both situation, firms are likely to expand&nbsp;their output and thus national income will increase. On the&nbsp;other hand at income level y<sub>2</sub> firms will find that they have&nbsp;increasing unsold stocks and it will not be long before they&nbsp;reduce their output thus NY decreases.<br>If national income were at Ye, planned expenditure would&nbsp;equal real output. Firms would not change level of output&nbsp;they produce and stocks would remain unchanged. National&nbsp;income would thus be in equilibrium. <br>In the second of the two graphs at y<sub>1</sub> planned injections are&nbsp;obviously greater than the leakages and thus national income&nbsp;will increase. With planned withdrawals exceeding planned&nbsp;injections, at y<sub>2</sub> firms would be unable to sell all of their&nbsp;output Thus there would be unplanned investment in stock&nbsp;and firms would cut back their output, leading to a decrease&nbsp;in national income. National income is only in equilibrium&nbsp;when planned withdrawals equal planned investment. <br>Now, changes to the equilibrium level of national income can&nbsp;also occur and this can be due to changes in injections or&nbsp;leakages. According to the Keynesian model, injections are&nbsp;autonomous, that is, they are independent of the level of&nbsp;income. So an increase in investment government expenditure&nbsp;and exports results in a parallel upward shift in the&nbsp;expenditure function leading to an increase in the size of the&nbsp;economy, that is, national income will rise. This can be shown&nbsp;graphically: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5fa4e407b0f2548f9ca9bde0eb44a4e0" alt="" width="383" height="401"> <br>From the graphs above we can see that an increase in injections&nbsp;has led to an increase in national income from Ye<sub>1</sub> to&nbsp;Ye<sub>2</sub>. This increase in injections, particularly in a developing&nbsp;country, might have been due to increasing investment by&nbsp;foreign multinationals, or else the government may initiate&nbsp;development programs thus increasing in spending in the&nbsp;economy. Also rising exports, possibly due to depreciation&nbsp;of the country's currency also causes X and hence injections&nbsp;to increase. <br>Another important point to note is that the resulting change&nbsp;in national income is much larger than the change in injections.&nbsp;This is attributed to what is known as the multiplier&nbsp;effect. Multiplier represents the number of times national&nbsp;income changes due to a given change in injections. Multiplier&nbsp;is denoted by K, and the value of K can be found by: <br>K = 1/mpw or K = (change in NY)/(change in J)<br>Marginal propensity to withdraw (MPW) is the sum of&nbsp;marginal propensity to save (MPS), marginal propensity to&nbsp;tax (MPT) and marginal propensity to import (MPM).&nbsp;MPW is inversely related to the value of the multiplier and&nbsp;generally, in a developing economy the multiplier effect is&nbsp;larger because it has a smaller MPW. This means that out of&nbsp;a given increase in income, people spend relatively greater&nbsp;proportion on consumption. This leads to a higher MPC (marginal propensity to consume) in developing economies.&nbsp;Since MPC and multiplier are directly related, so a higher MPC leads to a higher multiplier value and a large increase in national&nbsp;income. <br>The rationale underlying the multiplier effect is that the&nbsp;economy has continuous flows of expenditure and income&nbsp;through which money spent by an individual is received as&nbsp;income by another. Therefore it follows that an initial change&nbsp;in spending will cause a spending chain reaction which will&nbsp;cumulate to a multiple change in NY. In a developing economy&nbsp;with a higher mpc, this increase in national income is expected&nbsp;to be even larger. Another point to note is that the&nbsp;developing economies usually operate below the full employment&nbsp;level of output, so increases in national income are&nbsp;possible here, as the multiplier effect of injections will occur. <br>Thus it follows that NY equilibrium occurs when Y = E or&nbsp;W = J. Also changes in equilibrium can occur due to changes&nbsp;in injections or withdrawals but the ratio of change in NY&nbsp;is greater than the change in injections or leakages due to the&nbsp;multiplier effect.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 101</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9149</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>National income statistics are used to calculate a country's&nbsp;GDP.

<p>Discuss how far the table might be used to determine whether&nbsp;one country has higher living standards than another.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The standard of living is a measure of the material welfare of the inhabitants of a country. The base line measure of the standard of living is real GDP. This is the value of total output produced from all the resources located within the political borders of a country over one year time period. Real GDP figures can be used to make cross-country comparisons. But this requires converting GDP data into a common currency (normally the dollar or the Euro) which has been given. But we also need to make an adjustment to reflect differences in the average cost of goods and services in each country to produce data expressed at 'purchasing power parity' standard and therefore need information on cost of living in all five countries which has not been provided.</p>
<p>Apart from this it must be remembered that GDP on its own&nbsp;is both an inaccurate and insufficient indicator of true living standards both within and between countries. Thus the information provided in the question is of limited value for comparing living standard. The GDP figures would have been more useful if the figures of population of each of the countries were given because all countries have different sizes of population. For example, India's GDP needed to be divided by a population of approximately 1.2 billion to arrive at a GDP per capita or per head figure whereas the GDP of Mauritius only needed to be divided by a population of approximately 1.2 million. The result in terms of GDP per&nbsp;head can be different from that of GDP figure alone.</p>
<p>Therefore higher GDP does not necessarily imply that the citizens of the country enjoy higher living standard. Real GDP per head is calculated by dividing GDP on the population of the country. It is a measure of how much of real goods and services is available to the average citizen for consumption and investment. It is believed that there should be a strong positive correlation between RGDP per capita and economic well being; that is, greater production should move society toward "the good life". Therefore economists&nbsp;view levels and rates of growth of "real" per capita GDP,&nbsp;expressed in common currency, as a better indicator of comparing&nbsp;economic well being internationally than GDP figures&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p>However it is widely held that RGDP per head is also of limited value for inter-country comparison of living standard. Firstly, income distributions between the countries may&nbsp;be different also national income accounts will have varying degrees of inaccuracy, caused, for instance, by different sizes of the informal economy in each country. The informal or black economy includes economic activity that goes unrecorded. The non-monetised sectors of the economy include output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed products. Economist's latest estimates for the total value of the black economy throughout the world are $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. National income accounting conventions may also be different in different countries making it impossible to compare the two.</p>
<p>There is also the problem of what rate of exchange to use&nbsp;when comparing one country's GDP with another. The day-to-day market exchange rate can bear little relation to relative prices in different countries. So prices in some countries,&nbsp;like Switzerland or West Germany, can be much higher at official exchange rates than in France or Italy. Therefore if national income statistics are to be used to compare living standards between countries it is important to use an exchange rate which compares the cost of living in each country. These exchange rates are known as purchasing power parities. For instance, if a typical basket of goods costs 10 francs in France and £ 1 in the UK, then national income should be converted at an exchange rate of 10 francs to the £1 - even if the market exchange rate gives a very different figure.</p>
<p>Even this is not accurate enough. In some countries, consumers have to purchase goods which in others are free. For instance, Sweden spends a greater proportion of its national income than Italy on fuel for heating because of its colder climate. But this extra expenditure does not give the Swedes a higher standard of living. Again, countries are different geographically and one country might have higher transport costs per unit of output than another because of congestion&nbsp;or having to transport goods long distances. In practice, it is almost impossible to adjust national income figures for&nbsp;these sorts of differences. <br>It is believed that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being as a nation in comparison with other countries. Economists point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off than other countries without necessarily achieving higher RGDP per head, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse. Similarly, rising RGDP per head is usually accompanied by rising external cost, such as pollution, noise and accidents. These are not officially measured within national&nbsp;income but they do affect welfare and distort comparison of well-being between nations.</p>
<p>Measure of economic welfare (MEW) is one of the alternative measures developed to overcome these problems. This starts with GNP and NNP. To this was added an allowance. for leisure, for various non-marketed goods and services such as housework and underground activities, for the services of various public amenities such as parks and roads, and for&nbsp;private durable goods such as furniture and jewellery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various items were subtracted. These included “regrettables” such as expenditure on defense and commuting to work, and various "bads” such as pollution. Also various intermediate items such as the benefits of education were subtracted.</p>
<p>The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable&nbsp;estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result&nbsp;it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies&nbsp;around the world.</p>
<p>The most well-known measure of quality of life is the Human&nbsp;Development Index (HDI) that has been developed under the&nbsp;United Nations Development Programme.</p>
<p>The Human Development Index (HDI) is the average of three indicators:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita&nbsp;(PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average&nbsp;of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment&nbsp;ratio (one-third weight)<br><br>The closer the HDI is to 1, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three&nbsp;indicators.</p>
<p>The advantage of using HDI is that it highlights the fact that&nbsp;people's welfare is influenced not only by the goods and&nbsp;services available but also by their ability to lead a long and healthy life and to acquire knowledge, a combination of both&nbsp;qualitative and quantitative factors. Clearly, this index gives us a better way of estimating standards of living than just GDP taken on its own. However, it is still far from perfect. Economists have recently been looking at ways to include&nbsp;other factors in the measurement, such as income distribution, gender inequalities, and inequalities by region or by ethnic group. As a result they have developed the Human Poverty Index (HPI) that focuses on four basic dimensions of human life - longevity, knowledge, economic provisioning and social&nbsp;inclusion.</p>
<p>Thus it follows from the discussion above that GDP is an&nbsp;integral part of any measure comparing quality of life between nations but on its own it proves to be insufficient. A fair comparison of living standard must consider the data on&nbsp;other important quantitative and qualitative factors.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 102</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9146</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Recently, employers in some countries have employed foreign&nbsp;workers instead of local workers.

<li>Marginal revenue productivity theory predicts that a&nbsp;profit maximising firm will increase production up to&nbsp;the point at which the last worker employed adds just&nbsp;as much to revenue as it does to cost. In other words&nbsp;firm's marginal revenue product (MRPL) = firm's marginal&nbsp;cost of labour (MCL). In outlining the theory we&nbsp;will initially assume:
<ol>
<li>Perfectly competitive product market.</li>
<li>Perfectly competitive labour market.</li>
</ol>
<p>Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRPL) is the&nbsp;additional revenue a firm earns from employing one more&nbsp;worker. It is the revenue from output that each extra&nbsp;worker produces, i.e. the marginal physical product&nbsp;multiplied by the marginal revenue. Hence: <br><br>MRP labour = MPP labour x MR good <br><br>Marginal Physical Product (MPP) is the addition to total&nbsp;product as a result of the employment of an additional&nbsp;unit of labour whereas MR is the additional revenue&nbsp;from selling an extra unit. <br><br>Marginal Cost of Labour (MCL) is the addition to total&nbsp;cost resulting from employing an extra worker. Note, in&nbsp;a perfectly competitive labour market MCL = Wage rate&nbsp;and in a perfectly competitive product market P = MR. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a767e4d4152924700ad8d4a560139f40" alt="" width="334" height="189"><br><br>In figure above a profit maximizing firm faces a perfectly&nbsp;elastic supply curve for labour MCL = ACL<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>which means that additional labour can be hired at the&nbsp;same wage rate. So at W<sub>1</sub> wage rate the number of workers&nbsp;employed is 4 because the profit-maximizing firm hires&nbsp;the quantity of workers that equates the MRPL with&nbsp;the MCL (wage). If the wage rate was to fall to W<sub>2</sub> then&nbsp;the labour supply curve would shift to MCL = ACL<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and the firm would, therefore, increase the number of&nbsp;workers employed to 5. Thus a decrease in wage rate&nbsp;causes a movement along the curve from A to B and vice&nbsp;versa. The MRPL curve therefore represents the firm's&nbsp;demand curve for labour. It is important to note that the&nbsp;demand curve is only the downward slopingsection of&nbsp;the MRPL curve. <br><br>So profit seeking firms tend to hire more foreign workers&nbsp;if as compared to the local workers, either the cost&nbsp;of hiring them is low or MRPL is higher or both. The&nbsp;graph below sums up the situation with the assumption&nbsp;that the firm is wage taker. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/33e9ebfb42b2f35f831b370558a15a26" alt="" width="383" height="195"><br><br>In the graph MRPL curve of local workers is below the&nbsp;MRPL curve of foreign workers. This difference could&nbsp;be explained by the differences in MPP and can be&nbsp;attributed to the superior skills and higher level of&nbsp;motivation of the foreign workers resulting in a much&nbsp;higher output in the given time than the local workers.&nbsp;This difference could also arise due to health, vigor,&nbsp;education and training. This means that, even with the&nbsp;same quantity and quality of natural and capital resources&nbsp;foreign workers would be more efficient than their local&nbsp;counterparts. The result is higher MRPL and hence&nbsp;greater demand. <br><br>Assuming firm can hire both foreign and local workers&nbsp;at the given wage rate We, then the profit maximizing&nbsp;rule of MCL = MRPL results in NL employment of&nbsp;local workers but NF employment of foreign workers.&nbsp;Overall firms would prefer to hire foreign workers mainly&nbsp;due to the higher MRPL. <br><br>The other aspects include easy availability and relatively&nbsp;low wage acceptability by the foreign workers which&nbsp;induces the producers to prefer them to local workers.&nbsp;Cheaper foreign labour would reduce the cost and be&nbsp;reflected in the supply curve. <br><br>Thus we conclude that higher productivity of foreign&nbsp;workers is reflected in higher MRPL and hence greater&nbsp;demand for them whereas easy availability of cheap foreign&nbsp;labour is reflected in the supply of labour curve.&nbsp;In both situations profit-seeking businesses would prefer&nbsp;to hire foreign workers to local workers.</p>
</li>
<li>Hiring foreign workers for the reasons discussed in part&nbsp;'a' might cause unemployment of local workers thus&nbsp;worsening one of the most pressing macro economic&nbsp;issues. In a larger perspective growing unemployment&nbsp;of local workers brings numerous problems therefore it&nbsp;is important to keep unemployment levels as low as&nbsp;possible.<br><br>High unemployment is expensive for the government&nbsp;and, therefore, for the taxpayer. For every unemployed&nbsp;person, there are two costs to the government. First, the&nbsp;unemployed worker will be entitled to benefit. Secondly,&nbsp;there is the less obvious cost of the loss of tax revenue&nbsp;these workers would have been paying through their&nbsp;purchases. There are other costs of unemployment.&nbsp;There is the cost to the whole economy in terms of&nbsp;wasted, unused resources. The existence of any idle&nbsp;resources means that the economy will be at a point&nbsp;within its production possibility frontier (PPF).<br><br>Furthermore, unemployed workers (young men, in particular)&nbsp;may create other external costs in the economy,like crime for example. Finally, there is the personal&nbsp;human cost to each worker. In the short term the unemployed&nbsp;worker has to put up with the loss of earnings.&nbsp;But in the long run, the unemployed will find it&nbsp;harder and harder to find a job, as they find that the&nbsp;skills they have become less relevant and they have had&nbsp;no new training.<br><br>Preference to the local workers will help government to&nbsp;overcome these problems and achieve one of the most&nbsp;important macro economic objectives.<br>Besides this foreign workers tend to make sizable remittances&nbsp;to their families at home. This would cause increasing&nbsp;outflow of income and would result in worsening&nbsp;of current balance. Hiring more of local workers&nbsp;would keep most of the income earned with in the&nbsp;economy and hence would help to improve living standard.<br><br>Hiring local workers becomes even more important if a&nbsp;particular region is dependent on one major industry&nbsp;and does not offer alternative employment. Government&nbsp;may wish to increase employment of local workers in&nbsp;order to increase national income. Employment and&nbsp;national income are closely related therefore has a direct&nbsp;impact on the quality of life.<br><br>Achieving higher employment rate may have an impact&nbsp;on country's exports and imports and hence overall&nbsp;balance of payment. Government may wish to achieve&nbsp;high employment rate in order to produce goods the&nbsp;country is importing and to increase the output of goods&nbsp;country exports.<br><br>However, hiring foreign workers are not necessarily bad&nbsp;in all situations. Foreign workers increase the supply of&nbsp;goods and services with their labour and simultaneously&nbsp;increase the demand for goods and services with their&nbsp;income and spending. In short foreign workers, in particular&nbsp;situations, can prove to be an engine of growth.&nbsp;More efficient foreign workers can also help the country&nbsp;to maintain its comparative advantage which otherwise&nbsp;would have been eroded by the rising wage rate of&nbsp;less efficient local workers.<br><br>In the end it can be concluded that although foreign&nbsp;workers compete with domestic workers for scarce jobs,&nbsp;pull down the average level of real wages and burden the&nbsp;welfare system yet, in particular situations, they bring&nbsp;benefits in terms of efficiency, possibly higher growth&nbsp;and better living standard.</li>

<li>As a result of becoming bigger the firm gains internal&nbsp;economies of scale and enjoys a situation where costs&nbsp;per unit of output fall as the scale of production increases.&nbsp;Thus internal economies arise from within the&nbsp;firm itself as a result of its decision to become large.&nbsp;Their impact on cost structure is analyzed on a firm's&nbsp;long run average cost curve. A long run average cost&nbsp;curve (LRAC) shows how per unit cost varies with&nbsp;scale of production on the assumption that the least&nbsp;cost method of production will be chosen for each level&nbsp;of output. If the firm experiences internal economies of&nbsp;scale its LRAC curve will fall as shown in the graph&nbsp;below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a7f35f04cf27a5f52b60a1a94f3f1f39" alt="" width="378" height="209"><br><br>In the figure above, initially an expansion of output over&nbsp;time leads to a reduction in the unit costs. As explained&nbsp;above these cost saving benefits are referred to as internal&nbsp;economies of scale. They occur because the firm's&nbsp;output is rising proportionately faster than the inputs;&nbsp;hence the firm is getting increasing returns to scale. There&nbsp;are a number of reasons why firms are likely to experience&nbsp;economies of scale.<br><br>Firstly, technical economies refer to the advantages gained&nbsp;directly in the production process. For instance, as a&nbsp;firm grows in size it may be able to take advantage of&nbsp;increased specialization and division of labour. If the&nbsp;firm produces only a small output it may not be possible&nbsp;to employ a worker solely on one process but as&nbsp;the level of production increases workers may be able&nbsp;to specialise, leading to division of labour and hence&nbsp;lowering of the firm's per unit costs.<br>Furthermore, the firm benefits from what is known as&nbsp;increased dimensions. For example, if the size of a container&nbsp;is doubled its surface area is increased 4 fold and&nbsp;its volume is increased 8 fold. It is possible, therefore,&nbsp;to obtain cost savings by making use of larger containers,&nbsp;say, for the storage or distribution of finished products.&nbsp;A large firm may also devote proportionately more&nbsp;resources to research and development which could lead&nbsp;to an improvement in the quality of the goods and&nbsp;services produced, and possibly to a lowering of the&nbsp;cost per unit. Moreover a large firm can afford to link&nbsp;certain processes which lower cost per unit of output.&nbsp;For instance, a large firm can afford to have a rolling mill&nbsp;next to a steel mill, thus the steel is immediately rolled&nbsp;flat while still hot thus avoiding the need to reheat the&nbsp;steel sheet. <br><br>Secondly, the firm also gains on marketing its products.&nbsp;For instance, when a firm buys its raw materials in bulk&nbsp;it may benefit from preferential terms in the form of a&nbsp;discount, thus reducing the cost of each unit. Also a&nbsp;large firm may employ specialist buyers whose sole&nbsp;responsibility is to purchase raw materials at the cheapest&nbsp;price. Administration, advertising, and packaging costs&nbsp;may also be lower for larger companies since they can&nbsp;spread the cost over larger orders. For example, the&nbsp;packaging cost per item for 1 million units is likely to&nbsp;be substantially lower than if 100 items were packaged.&nbsp;On the financial front larger firms may be able to obtain&nbsp;finance on favourable terms, obtaining loans from financial&nbsp;institutions at lower rates of interest. Banks will be&nbsp;more willing to give loan on preferential terms to a large, well-known company, which can offer more collateral as&nbsp;security for the loan, than it will to a smaller company.&nbsp;<br>Apart from this large firms normally produce more than&nbsp;one product and are, therefore, in a position to take&nbsp;advantage of economies of scope. Economies of scope&nbsp;refer to the reduction in average total cost (ATC) made&nbsp;possible by a firm increasing the number of different&nbsp;goods it produces. The reason is that the firm is able&nbsp;to take advantage of skilled staff and technology which&nbsp;can be shared by the different goods produced. <br><br>Thus increasing scale of production may generate internal&nbsp;economies of scale leading to a reduction in costs per&nbsp;unit of output.<br><br></li>
<li>Marginal cost (MC) is the extra cost of producing one&nbsp;more unit of output. MC is determined by the following:<br><br>MC = (Change in Total cost (TC))/(Change in output)<br>or&nbsp;MC = TC<sub>n</sub> - TC<sub>n-1<br></sub><br>In the short run MC can also be calculated from the&nbsp;total variable cost because the only difference between&nbsp;total cost and total fixed cost is the constant amount of&nbsp;fixed cost. Thus the change in TC and that of variable&nbsp;cost for an extra unit of output is always the same. A&nbsp;typical MC curve first shows a decline, it reaches the&nbsp;minimum and then rises. This shape of MC curve is a&nbsp;consequence of the law of diminishing returns.<br><br>Relationship between the marginal cost curve of the firm&nbsp;and the supply curve of the industry can only be established&nbsp;in a perfectly competitive market.<br>Perfect competition is characterized by large number of&nbsp;relatively small firms producing homogeneous products&nbsp;in the absence of entry exit barriers. Price in such conditions&nbsp;is determined by total demand and supply forces&nbsp;in the market and each individual firm produces such a&nbsp;small fraction of total output that a change in its output&nbsp;does not affect the total market supply. Thus all the&nbsp;firms are price takers and each firm faces a perfectly&nbsp;elastic demand curve.<br>For a perfectly competitive firm its demand curve is&nbsp;simultaneously its average revenue (AR) and marginal&nbsp;revenue (MR) curve i.e. AR = MR = Price. Profit maximization&nbsp;rule suggests that firm maximizes revenue or minimizes&nbsp;loss where MC= MR as shown in the graph&nbsp;below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a03666408203fdda9f587803220fe9c7" alt="" width="277" height="209"><br><br>Thus the profit-seeking competitive firm, faced with&nbsp;certain costs, would choose to offer OQ output at OP&nbsp;price because firm's MC= MR. Since P = MR therefore&nbsp;this information - product price and corresponding&nbsp;quantity supplied - gives us a point on the supply&nbsp;curve for the competitive firm.<br>The graph below illustrates the MR= MC rule and the&nbsp;relationship between short-run MC and the firm's supply&nbsp;behavior. The ATC, AVC, and MC curves are shown,&nbsp;along with several marginal-revenue lines drawn at possible&nbsp;market prices. Let's observe quantity supplied at&nbsp;each of these prices:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1f08f6e033c31fb28938afb12f4d0507" alt="" width="356" height="262"><br><br>In the graph above price OP<sub>1</sub> is below the firm's minimum&nbsp;average variable cost, so at this price the firm won't&nbsp;operate at all. Quantity supplied will be zero, as it will&nbsp;be at all other prices below P<sub>2</sub>. Price P<sub>2</sub> is just equal to&nbsp;the minimum average variable cost. The firm will supply&nbsp;units of output (where MR<sub>2</sub> = MC) and just cover&nbsp;its total variable cost. Its loss will equal its total fixed&nbsp;cost. Actually, the firm would be indifferent shutting&nbsp;down or supplying Q<sub>2</sub> units of output but we assume&nbsp;it produces.<br><br>At price P<sub>3</sub> the firm will supply Q<sub>3</sub> units to minimize&nbsp;its short-run losses. At any other price between P<sub>2</sub> and&nbsp;P<sub>4&nbsp;</sub>the firm will minimize its losses by producing and&nbsp;supplying the quantity at which MR (= P) = MC.<br><br>The firm will just break even at price P<sub>4</sub>. It will supply&nbsp;Q<sub>4</sub> units of output (where MR<sub>4</sub> = MC), earning a normal&nbsp;profit but not economic profit i.e. total revenue will&nbsp;just cover total cost, including a normal profit.<br>Note that each of the MR (= P) = MC intersection points&nbsp;labeled b, c, d and e. Figure above indicates possible&nbsp;product price corresponding quantity which the firm&nbsp;would supply at that price. Thus, points such as these&nbsp;are on the upward sloping supply curve of the competitive&nbsp;firm. Note too that quantity supplied would be&nbsp;zero at any price below the minimum average variable&nbsp;cost (AVC). Therefore we conclude that the portion of&nbsp;the rising marginal-cost curve lying above average-variable-cost&nbsp;curve is short-run supply curve. In Figure the&nbsp;solid segment of the marginal cost curve MC is this&nbsp;firm's short-run curve because it tells us the amount of&nbsp;output the firm supplies at each price. However, in the&nbsp;long run the rising portion of long run marginal cost&nbsp;curve (LRMC) above long run average cost curve&nbsp;(LRAC) is the firm's supply curve.<br>&nbsp;<br>So far we have developed the competitive firm's short&nbsp;run supply curve by applying the MR (=p) = MC. We&nbsp;can now derive the industry's supply curve by adding&nbsp;the supply curves of the individual competitive firms.&nbsp;Thus the industry's supply curve is the horizontal sum&nbsp;of the rising portion of MC curves of all individual firms.<br><br>On the contrary monopolist has no supply curve because&nbsp;there is no relationship between price and quantity&nbsp;supplied. Like the competitive firm, the monopolist&nbsp;equates MR and MC to determine output, but for the&nbsp;monopolist MR is less than price. Because the monopolist&nbsp;does not equate MC to price, it is possible for&nbsp;different demand conditions to bring about different&nbsp;prices for the same output. To consider this we use the&nbsp;following graph:&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e32a3337559768de0210a510da8476ce" alt="" width="285" height="242"><br><br>The MR<sub>2</sub> intersects the MC curve at the same point,&nbsp;as does the MR<sub>1</sub>. With the AR<sub>2</sub> and MR<sub>2</sub> the same&nbsp;output OQ now corresponds with a higher profit maximization&nbsp;price.<br><br>In conclusion a relationship between the marginal cost&nbsp;curve of the firm and the supply curve of the industry&nbsp;can be established only in a perfectly competitive market.&nbsp;However, no such relationship exists in any other form&nbsp;of market structure.</li>

<p>Discuss the economic implications of the government's&nbsp;approach to the situation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Restoration of fire-stricken areas would require considerable&nbsp;resources to be diverted from elsewhere. Its economic&nbsp;implications depend on the amount of resources&nbsp;required to restore these areas. However, whatever the&nbsp;amount of resources needed they have to come from&nbsp;somewhere and would definitely strain government's&nbsp;budget.</p>
<p>A budget is an estimation of how much revenue government&nbsp;expects to receive and how much money it expects&nbsp;lo pay out, and with the expected balance between the&nbsp;two. The government's current receipts are revenues from&nbsp;taxes, and from anything that it sells. Government's&nbsp;current outlays include the funds that it spends. A budget&nbsp;deficit in any one-year is where government's expenditure&nbsp;exceeds its revenue from taxation. A budget surplus&nbsp;is where tax revenues exceed central government expenditure.</p>
<p>Australian government will have to allocate a considerable&nbsp;amount of resources on restoration program and&nbsp;therefore will have to raise finances. The magnitude of&nbsp;the restoration work would certainly require the government&nbsp;to raise more money through increasing taxation.&nbsp;But if the tax rates are already too high and the economy&nbsp;is going through a lean economic period then it might&nbsp;not be possible. Besides this higher tax rates discourage&nbsp;investment and can cause an increase in outflow of much&nbsp;needed capital for economic progress.</p>
<p>The other options include either a diversion of resources&nbsp;from elsewhere or funds generation through borrowing&nbsp;or both. Diversion of resources to the devastated areas&nbsp;means a cut back in spending on say other development&nbsp;projects, welfare payments or defense. There is thus an&nbsp;opportunity cost involved in terms of sacrificing say a&nbsp;construction of dams, new schools and hospitals, modernization&nbsp;of armed forces or anything that could have&nbsp;been produced from the same resources.</p>
<p>The other option for the Australian government is to&nbsp;borrow funds by making a deficit budget. If the&nbsp;government's budget is in deficit, the shortfall must be&nbsp;made up by borrowing funds. Thus the Australian government&nbsp;deficit has to be matched by an equivalent&nbsp;amount of government borrowing. This new borrowing&nbsp;would add to the country's national debt which is the&nbsp;total of outstanding government debt. The governmen&nbsp;may borrow funds from two main sources. First, it may&nbsp;borrow from the private sector. Both households and&nbsp;private-sector banks lend money to the government by&nbsp;buying Treasury bills and government stocks. Second,&nbsp;the government may borrow money from the central&nbsp;bank. Borrowing from general public is not inflationary&nbsp;but it increases interest rate and therefore discourages&nbsp;investment by crowding out the private sector. However&nbsp;borrowing from other sources would increase money&nbsp;supply and therefore would be inflationary.</p>
<p>A positive outcome of such a large scale restoration&nbsp;program is that it might create much needed jobs for the&nbsp;unemployed which will not only increase incomes of&nbsp;the newly employed but will have a multiple effect on&nbsp;Australian GDP.</p>
<p>So far as the impact on trade balance is concerned it&nbsp;depends on whether the restoration program uses domestic&nbsp;resources or the country imports resources such&nbsp;as capital, labour and raw material. It might worsen trade&nbsp;balance if Australia imports the required resources.</p>
<p>Finally the issue of efficiency will be of interest for&nbsp;many. This means how efficiently the restoration work&nbsp;is done. Public enterprises are usually criticized for&nbsp;inefficiencies whereas private sector is believed to use&nbsp;resources more efficiently. Therefore it can be argued&nbsp;that efficiency level will depend on whether the work&nbsp;is contracted out to the private sector or simply this&nbsp;task is assigned to the public enterprises.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that a widespread restoration&nbsp;program will have important economic implications on&nbsp;the overall outlook of Australian economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 105</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9121</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In 2009 there were huge fires in Australia which destroyed&nbsp;much property and countryside.

It occurs when society is using its&nbsp;scarce resources to produce the highest possible amount&nbsp;of goods and services. When economists use the term&nbsp;efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when&nbsp;right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce&nbsp;right products. In other words allocative efficiency&nbsp;occurs when the value that consumers place on a good&nbsp;or service (price) equals the cost of the resources (marginal&nbsp;cost) used up in production. The technical condition&nbsp;required for allocative efficiency is that price&nbsp;= marginal cost. When this happens economic welfare&nbsp;measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus is&nbsp;maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/82866529c565e04177c4a77f5d56ee58" alt="" width="244" height="185"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS,&nbsp;producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium&nbsp;in the market implies P = MC, hence, generating maximum&nbsp;possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus&nbsp;with the given supply and demand curves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/3b23f725376d39270ebebab631465e8e" alt="" width="297" height="206"></p>
<p>P &gt; MC indicates that fewer resources have been allocated&nbsp;than what are required to achieve perfect allocation.&nbsp;To prove this, consider if only 100,000 units were&nbsp;produced, the price would exceed its marginal cost. In&nbsp;money terms, price might be $15, while MC is only $5.&nbsp;This suggests that society would be under-allocating&nbsp;resources to the production; more of it should be produced.&nbsp;Each additional unit up to 200,000 would increase&nbsp;both consumer and producer surplus indicated by&nbsp;triangle A, hence would improve allocative efficiency.&nbsp;But when P = MC, the benefit of producing this product&nbsp;and alternative products with the available resources&nbsp;are equal, i.e. allocative efficiency is achieved.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production&nbsp;and can be applied both to the short run and long&nbsp;run. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize&nbsp;the wastage of resources i.e. when they produce&nbsp;a product using the least possible resources or generating&nbsp;the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below&nbsp;shows this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/97ad62650f03c373bdd35f2f37a59b70" alt="" width="301" height="213"></p>
<p>In the figure above AC<sub>3</sub> indicates productive efficiency. This means that the lowest possible cost techniques of&nbsp;production are being used to produce different level of&nbsp;output. All other curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per&nbsp;unit cost hence represent productive inefficiency. The&nbsp;firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when&nbsp;production occurs at the lowest point indicated by point&nbsp;z on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the&nbsp;term technical efficiency for this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an optimal allocation of resources productive efficiency&nbsp;is a necessary but insufficient condition. For&nbsp;instance, there is little point in producing items at lowest&nbsp;cost if they are not the products most valued by&nbsp;consumers. Thus allocative efficiency is also required.&nbsp;Finally it can be stated that any point on the PPC is&nbsp;necessarily productively efficient however a point on&nbsp;PPC is possibly efficient in terms of allocation of resources.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 106</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9120</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Success of Supermarkets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In some countries supermarkets dominate food shopping. In the UK 75% of the food bought for home use&nbsp;comes from supermarkets. A third of that comes from one supermarket, Tesco. Tesco makes billions of&nbsp;pounds profit, one third of which goes to the government in taxes. It employs 110000 people in the UK&nbsp;and many more in developing countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the past, UK shoppers queued to buy expensive food from many small shops with limited choice and&nbsp;restricted opening times. Now, in supermarkets, they have the benefit of a wide choice, reasonable prices,&nbsp;international dishes, organic produce, fair trade items, clear labels of the contents of the products and, because&nbsp;of intense competition between the supermarkets, some open 24 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, the media complain that supermarkets are not competitive but monopolies. They say their profits&nbsp;are too high, they have caused small shops to close and forced suppliers in developing countries to accept&nbsp;low prices and to pay low wages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It must be remembered that supermarkets grew because they gave the customer what they wanted and aimed&nbsp;at certain types of shoppers. One supermarket, which started as a small shop, insisted on selling only high&nbsp;quality products while another offered customers low prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Supermarkets also adapted to changing market trends. One began to supply products with its own brand&nbsp;name which were sold more cheaply because there were no advertising costs. A further brilliant idea in&nbsp;expanding their business was the introduction of a store loyalty card. Shoppers with a loyalty card are given&nbsp;discounts which encourages them to continue to shop in the same supermarket.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most successful supermarkets expanded their businesses by buying large sites to build huge stores. (They&nbsp;are criticised for such building, especially if it destroys parts of the countryside or environment.) They&nbsp;expanded into non-food products to fill these stores, making it possible for consumers to buy many household&nbsp;items from clothes to kitchen utensils to electrical goods in the same shop. Supermarkets have also&nbsp;recently introduced on line shopping and home deliveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many small shops have closed. There are bound to be casualties in retailing. How can the blame for that&nbsp;be the fault of the supermarket? Their size should not be a concern. It is, after all, the consumer who decides&nbsp;where to shop and what to buy.</p>

<li>With the growing trend of large supermarkets the market structure of food retailing in the UK has evidently changed from the past when shoppers queued to buy expensive food from many small shops with limited choice and restricted opening times. The fact that 75% of the food bought for home use comes from supermarkets and a third of that comes from one supermarket, suggests that the food retailing is now an oligopolistic market or a monopoly in legal terms. This size of market share of larger supermarkets reflects high concentration ratio and a greater degree of interdependence. There is, therefore, intense competition between the rival supermarkets that has led to the competitive marketing strategies such as branding, advertisement and various sales boosting measures.<br><br></li>
<li>The term consumer sovereignty entails that the ultimate purchaser of products determines what, in fact, is produced. The article mentions that supermarkets gave consumers what they wanted e.g. selling organic and fair trade products in response to consumers' preferences. This particular response of supermarkets seems to support the idea that the consumer is sovereign. However, other actions of supermarkets do not support it. For instance it was the supermarkets which decided to expand and introduce new products. Other measures such as introducing own product brands, store cards and controlling suppliers are purely sellers' decisions. The aim of such actions is to increase market share and restrict competition, therefore, do not support the idea of consumer sovereignty.<br><br></li>
<li>The traditional theory of the firm tends to make a standard assumption that businesses possess the information, market power and motivation to set a price and output that maximises profits in the short or long run. This assumption is now criticized by behavioural economists who believe that modern corporations are complex organizations made up of various groups or stakeholders. Each of these groups is likely to have different objectives or goals at different points in time. The dominant group at any moment in time can give greater emphasis to their own objectives.<br><br>So if firms are likely to move away from pure profit maximizing behavior, what are the alternatives? The reality is that there are numerous different objectives. For instance, many firms operate for satisficing profit. Satisficing behaviour involves the owners setting minimum acceptable levels of achievement in terms of business revenue and profit.<br><br>It is argued that in manager-controlled businesses, annual salaries and other perks might be more closely correlated with total sales revenue rather than profits. Thus managers focus on sales revenue maximization rather than profit. Many firms aim for growth maximization in the size because manager may obtain higher salaries and greater power in a larger firm.<br><br></li>
<li>Large supermarkets controlling food retail market is certainly a cause of concern for various reasons. The fact that the food retail market becoming more imperfectly competitive entails that there is a possibility of firms adopting anticompetitive measures in order to maximize industry's profit. In such situations the consumers will have to pay higher prices for food than competitive prices thus resulting in substantially higher profits at the expense of consumer welfare. The article also mentions the anti-competitive behaviour of supermarkets regarding control over suppliers. This means that the new firms will find it difficult to establish as most of the suppliers will be bound to sell their output to those already controlling them. Closure of some competitors will also reduce the degree of competition in the market making these firms even bigger and economically more powerful. On top of everything destruction of environment is evident&nbsp;from their expansion plans which involve buying of large sites to build huge stores thus resulting in a destruction of countryside and damages to environment.<br><br>On the other hand the establishment of large supermarkets has benefited shoppers in many different ways. For instance, large supermarkets offer variety thus giving much wider choice to buyers. They have also introduced trends such as 24 hours shopping and delivery at home thus making household shopping more convenient than ever. Furthermore, branding and ensuring quality also benefit the shoppers in terms of less price and better value for their money. <br>Although large retail markets have benefited the shoppers in various different ways yet one cannot completely rule out the potential dangers of a few giant sellers controlling food retail market. Therefore it requires authorities to introduce laws and regulations in order to protect the buyers from possible exploitation.</li>

However, governments may not be as&nbsp;efficient as desired. In dealing with an inflationary or&nbsp;recessionary situation, there are factors that undermine&nbsp;government measure. There are also time lags. I shall&nbsp;deal with the problem of a downturn (recession) in the&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>The essence of the Keynesian model is that a country&nbsp;will come out of a recession with sufficient injections&nbsp;of demand into the economy. An injection of money&nbsp;through multiplier effect leads to a multiple increase in&nbsp;national income. Prices will rise and employment will be&nbsp;increasing in order to meet the rising demand. Eventually&nbsp;the country comes out of recession.</p>
<p>The government can maintain a high level of aggregate&nbsp;demand through expansionary fiscal policy, and monetary&nbsp;policy or else government can use some direct&nbsp;controls.</p>
<p>An expansionary or inflationary fiscal policy will&nbsp;involve raising government expenditure and/or lowering&nbsp;taxes this will have the effect of either increasing the&nbsp;budget deficit or reducing the budget surplus. It is where&nbsp;the government alters the balance between government&nbsp;expenditure (G) and taxation (t), and thereby alters the&nbsp;balance between injections and withdrawals. In this way&nbsp;it controls aggregate demand. Faced with a recession, it&nbsp;should raise G and/or lower T. In other words, the&nbsp;government should run a budget deficit rather than a&nbsp;balanced budget. There will then be a multiplier effect&nbsp;as shown by the sequence below:</p>
<p>↑ G &nbsp;or ↓ T→J &gt; W→Y↑ ⇒ ↑W until J = W.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;eventual rise in aggregate demand and hence output&nbsp;would rise. &nbsp;In the case of fiscal measures, the government may lower&nbsp;taxes in order to reduce the fall in disposable income.&nbsp;For unemployed, the government as part of welfare&nbsp;policy gives unemployment handouts. Both these measures&nbsp;at least help to keep demand from falling further.</p>
<p>On the expenditure side, the government maintains all&nbsp;public projects and obligations. The government may&nbsp;even embark on new public projects for the purpose of&nbsp;providing jobs in order to keep aggregate demand strong.</p>
<p>On the monetary side, various quantitative and qualitative&nbsp;tools can be used in order to increase the money&nbsp;supply and lower interest rate. This will boost consumer expenditure and business investments The central&nbsp;bank can lower its lending rate, buy up government&nbsp;securities and relax regulations on reserve ratios and&nbsp;special deposits. All controls on mortgage, deferred&nbsp;payments and hire purchases can be relaxed in order to&nbsp;stimulate demand.&nbsp;<br>In case of direct controls compulsory savings contributions&nbsp;by employees and employers can be reduced, the&nbsp;government can allow a lower age for compulsory pension&nbsp;funds withdrawals. The consumption of certain&nbsp;goods and services can be made compulsory. Examples&nbsp;are estate, cars and machinery maintenance must be clone&nbsp;regularly.</p>
<p>However getting out of a recession may not be that&nbsp;simple. A recession prevails because of negative expectations.&nbsp;Consumers and producers believe that the situation&nbsp;in near future can get even worse. Demand therefore&nbsp;falls further, leading to more stocks accumulation&nbsp;and more retrenchment. Thus they would save even&nbsp;more to last out the bad times. The increase in money&nbsp;supply brought about by the government's expansionary&nbsp;policy is, therefore, simply leaked away. <br>Leakages may also come in the form of imports and&nbsp;capital outflows. The former is unlikely but the latter&nbsp;happens because the rich seeks their fortune in other&nbsp;countries where economics are booming.</p>
<p>In order to bring its economy out of a recession. the&nbsp;government has to convince people that conditions are&nbsp;favourable for investment and consumption. The government&nbsp;would have to cap all leakages. This can be&nbsp;done by reassuring the public that the economy is picking&nbsp;up. Publishing economic indicators would convince&nbsp;the business class of rising demand. The government&nbsp;may also have to ban the outflow of capital.</p>
<p>Another problem is that production may not be able to&nbsp;expand, if the infrastructure of the economy has deteriorated&nbsp;or if there are still labour management problems.&nbsp;The government would have to remove all such&nbsp;'bottle-necks' by intervening directly into the markets.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more serious problem facing the government&nbsp;is financing a budget deficit. How is a government&nbsp;going to spend more than it collects? It will have to&nbsp;borrow, which would be difficult domestically (Incomes&nbsp;have already fallen). If it borrows externally, it has been&nbsp;argued that the recession has been postponed to a later&nbsp;elate. This is because the government will have to pay&nbsp;back even more in the future. The increases in taxes and&nbsp;reduction in expenditure in the future may bring back&nbsp;the recession.</p>
<p>Thus the government has to adopt a variety of different&nbsp;quantitative and qualitative measures in order to pull&nbsp;the economy out of recession.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 108</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9111</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In some countries there has been fear of economic&nbsp;recession in recent years.

But the long run economic growth&nbsp;has not always been steady; it is frequently interrupted&nbsp;by periods of economic instability. On various times&nbsp;growth has given way to recession and depression, that&nbsp;is, to declines in employment and real output. These&nbsp;fluctuations in economic activities are associated with&nbsp;business cycles.</p>
<p>Recurrent ups and downs over a period of years in the&nbsp;level of economic activity are attributed to business cycles&nbsp;as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2e6acd141b62524efebaaaac867f910a" alt="" width="393" height="215"></p>
<p>Real GDP measures the total production of goods and&nbsp;services for the whole economy over a year and is an&nbsp;indicator of the level of economic activities. Real growth&nbsp;is measured by the annual rate of change of real GDP.</p>
<p>Although the phases of business fluctuations are&nbsp;described by a series of commonly used terms, no two&nbsp;cycles are the same. Starting from a lower turning point,&nbsp;a cycle goes through a phase of recovery (expansion),&nbsp;reaches an upper turning point, and then enters a period&nbsp;of recession. Cycles differ from one another in the&nbsp;severity of their troughs and peaks, and in the speed&nbsp;with which one phase follows another. Sometimes the&nbsp;entire rising half of the cycle is loosely referred to as&nbsp;a boom and the entire falling half is called a slump.</p>
<p>Common usage defines a recession as a fall in real GDP&nbsp;for two quarters in succession. This downturn is marked&nbsp;by the widespread contraction of business in many&nbsp;sectors of the economy. Demand falls off, and as a&nbsp;result, production and employment also fall. As&nbsp;employment falls, so do personal incomes. Profits drop,&nbsp;and some firms encounter financial difficulties. Business&nbsp;prospects are poor. Confidence is low therefore investment&nbsp;remains low. The effects on capital goods industry&nbsp;may thus be severe. Firms, finding their stocks of goods&nbsp;rising, cut back on production. Where cuts in production are very large then aggregate demand actually falls&nbsp;and there is a multiplied fall in national income. But&nbsp;because many prices are downwardly inflexible, the price&nbsp;level is likely to fall only if the recession is severe and&nbsp;prolonged. In historical discussion, a recession that is&nbsp;deep and long lasting is often called depression.</p>
<p>Lower economic activities are expected to result in decline&nbsp;in both the government tax revenue and the level of&nbsp;imports. Hence. the budget deficit of the government is&nbsp;likely to rise but the trade balance is expected to improve&nbsp;because decreasing incomes result in declining&nbsp;imports.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 109</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9108</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>The demand for money refers to the amount of wealth&nbsp;everyone in the economy wishes to hold in the form of&nbsp;money balances. In the Keynesian analysis of the rate&nbsp;of interest, it is not based purely on the demand for new&nbsp;capital goods. In fact, Keynes argued that there are three&nbsp;distinct motives for preferring to hold wealth in the form&nbsp;of money as opposed to holding either non-money&nbsp;financial assets or physical assets.<br><strong><br></strong>The transactions demand for money <br>Individuals need to hold money in order to meet daily&nbsp;transactions such as buying petrol, paying for groceries&nbsp;or purchasing a newspaper. Everyone will hold a certain&nbsp;amount of money since they are normally paid weekly&nbsp;or monthly whereas their expenditure is spread over the&nbsp;whole period. The average amount held for transactions&nbsp;purposes depends upon the level of money income the&nbsp;price level, the time of the year and the frequency of&nbsp;pay days. In terms of money income the higher the&nbsp;money income, the more likely the individual is to&nbsp;purchase more goods and services, and therefore require&nbsp;extra transactions balances. If the price level increases&nbsp;the demand for money for transactions purposes will be&nbsp;higher. In the case of the frequency of pay days, the&nbsp;more frequent, the lower the transactions demand for&nbsp;money. <br><strong><br></strong>The precautionary demand for money <br>The demand for money is also based on the desire to&nbsp;provide for the unexpected. The precautionary demand&nbsp;for money allows the individual to cover unforeseen&nbsp;events, such as the car breaking down, a lengthy period&nbsp;off work through illness, or an unexpected redundancy.&nbsp;It is likely to be the case that as the rate of interest&nbsp;increases, the precautionary demand for money will fall&nbsp;as individuals place their money in interest-bearing&nbsp;assets, i.e. the cost of 'holding' money has increased.<br><br>Money balances held for these two purposes is called&nbsp;active balances (L<sub>1</sub>) i.e. money to be used as a medium&nbsp;of exchange. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/16024e39964c7e5ae7b8da50836e1933" alt="" width="329" height="235"><br><strong><br></strong>The speculative demand for money <br>Speculative demand for money is based on the expectation&nbsp;of making a speculative gain or avoiding a loss.&nbsp;Money balances held for this purpose are called idle&nbsp;balances (L<sub>2</sub>). Keynes outlined the speculative demand&nbsp;for money in terms of the desire to hold money or fixed&nbsp;income bonds. It is important to note that the price of&nbsp;bonds and the rate of interest are inversely related. When&nbsp;the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly high by&nbsp;individuals they will assume that the next move is in a&nbsp;downward direction. As stated, when the rate of interest&nbsp;falls the price of bonds increases and so there are capital&nbsp;gains to be made. This being so when the rate of interest&nbsp;is high there will be a substantial demand for bonds and&nbsp;hence a low speculative demand to hold money. If,&nbsp;however, the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly&nbsp;low then individuals will assume that the next move is&nbsp;upwards, resulting in a fall in bond prices and, therefore,&nbsp;a capital loss for those who own bonds. If this is the&nbsp;case, the demand for bonds is likely to be low and those&nbsp;owning bonds will be looking to sell them before the&nbsp;price falls. In this situation the speculative demand for&nbsp;money will be high as shown in the graph below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/42d335fb7ae06939ce4ad57ea652c4d1" alt="" width="375" height="234"><br><br>The total demand for money LP is plotted against the&nbsp;rate of interest (r), This is found by the horizontal&nbsp;addition of curves L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/913c545a47565de99174309d52bac6b5" alt="" width="436" height="231"><br><br>Any factor other than a change in interest rates, that&nbsp;causes the demand for money to rise will shift the LP&nbsp;curve to the right. For example, a rise in national income&nbsp;or price level will cause L<sub>1</sub> to increase, and thus LP will&nbsp;shift to the right and vice versa. A change in interest rate&nbsp;causes movement along the demand for money curve&nbsp;upward or downward.</li>
<li>The transaction demand for money varies directly with&nbsp;the money income. Thus the employee moving to another&nbsp;job because it pays more will increase his cash balances&nbsp;because more money income will lead to higher consumption&nbsp;and hence higher demand for money for transactions&nbsp;purpose. The precautionary demand for money, like the&nbsp;transactions motive, causes the demand for money to vary&nbsp;positively with the rise in money income.<br><br>The frequency with which people are paid also affects&nbsp;demand for money. The less frequently they are paid,&nbsp;the greater the level of money balances they will tend&nbsp;to hold. Since the new job will pay monthly, unlike old&nbsp;job which was paid weekly, therefore it is expected to&nbsp;result in a rise in cash balances held for transactions&nbsp;purpose. For example, if the individual earned £ 100 per&nbsp;week and his expenditure were spread evenly over the&nbsp;week and he spent all the £100 by the end of the week,&nbsp;would have roughly £50 (in the bank or in cash) on&nbsp;average: that is, midway between pay days. Now if he&nbsp;is being paid £500 per month he will have roughly £250&nbsp;on average: that is, mid-month. Thus he will have a&nbsp;much higher demand for transactions purpose.<br><br>However the increased use of credit cards in recent years&nbsp;has reduced both the transactions and precautionary&nbsp;demands. Paying once a month for goods requires less&nbsp;money on average than paying separately for each item&nbsp;purchased. Also the possession of a credit card reduces&nbsp;or even eliminates the need to hold precautionary balances&nbsp;for many people.<br><br>At high rates of interest, people may choose to spend&nbsp;less and save more of their income. The higher rate of&nbsp;interest might encourage some minor reduction in transactions&nbsp;demand on a temporary basis. The effect is likely&nbsp;to be bigger on the precautionary demand: a higher&nbsp;interest rate may encourage people to risk tying up their&nbsp;money. If precautionary demand is for unexpected&nbsp;expenditure there will be no change, assuming expectations&nbsp;are the same.<br>The effects on transaction and precautionary demand&nbsp;for money is shown in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/07583ec9977a999e9e833f5e5ae47110" alt="" width="350" height="250"><br><br>A rise in money income and increase in the interval with&nbsp;which the employee is paid is expected to shift transactions&nbsp;and precautionary demand for money curve (L<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;rightward. However there is minimal effect of rise in the&nbsp;rate of interest on these two types of demand for money.<br><br>So far as the speculative demand for money is concerned&nbsp;it mainly depends on the rate of interest. People&nbsp;who possess wealth have to decide the best form in&nbsp;which to hold wealth, for instance, cash or financial and&nbsp;physical assets. Assets can be compared according to&nbsp;the liquidity and possibility of earning income. Cash is&nbsp;totally liquid to the holder but it earns no interest. Stocks&nbsp;and shares, on the other hand, are not very liquid but&nbsp;they have the potential of earning quite a high income&nbsp;for the holder. There is therefore an opportunity cost&nbsp;to a household if it holds £300 in cash. It could instead&nbsp;buy shares, and receive dividends and possibly capital&nbsp;gains, hence the price of holding money is the benefits&nbsp;foregone from holding another type of asset. The higher&nbsp;the interest rate the higher the opportunity cost of&nbsp;holding cash. Therefore if the rate of interest is high, to&nbsp;take advantage of the high rate of return people buy&nbsp;bonds and securities instead of holding on to their money.&nbsp;Hence cash holding for speculative motive is going to&nbsp;decrease. Similarly if the rate of interest is low people&nbsp;hold larger cash balances for speculative motive because&nbsp;the opportunity of holding cash is low. Thus at high&nbsp;rate the employ's cash balances for speculative motive&nbsp;is expected to be lower as compared to the cash holding&nbsp;at low rate of interest.<br><br>To further explain the changes in speculative cash balances&nbsp;let's assume that the only alternative to holding&nbsp;money is to hold bonds. Since price of bonds is inversely&nbsp;related to the rate of interest, therefore it is&nbsp;possible to make a capital gain by buying bonds when&nbsp;their prices are low and selling them when they are higher.&nbsp;Hence the employee will buy bonds when interest rates&nbsp;are high hoping that interest rates will fall and therefore&nbsp;bond prices will rise. Bonds will be bought with money.&nbsp;So a high demand for bonds means a low speculative&nbsp;demand for money.</li>

<p>Analyse whether the above is what marginal revenue product&nbsp;theory predicts will happen when a labour market becomes&nbsp;less competitive and large investment takes place.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive&nbsp;labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate&nbsp;is determined by the demand for and supply of labour. Many&nbsp;firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type&nbsp;of labour characterize this type of market. Also, there are&nbsp;numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently&nbsp;supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility&nbsp;and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both&nbsp;firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing&nbsp;horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal&nbsp;revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal&nbsp;revenue product MRPL, is the increase in revenue due&nbsp;to employing one more unit of labour. MRP<sub>L</sub> is determined&nbsp;by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied&nbsp;by the MR i.e. MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is&nbsp;no union; workers compete individually for available jobs.&nbsp;The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward,&nbsp;indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage&nbsp;rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must&nbsp;bid these workers away from other industries. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6c0fd64cc88ada34505453ae07070153" alt="" width="454" height="210"><br><br>In the figure above both equilibrium wage rate and level of&nbsp;employment are determined by the intersection of the market&nbsp;demand and supply curves as depicted in the left part of the&nbsp;graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this&nbsp;type of labor up to the point at which its marginal revenue&nbsp;product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is equal to marginal cost of labour (MC<sub>L</sub>)&nbsp;shown in the right part of the graph.</p>
<p>Although economic theory of wage determination is primarily&nbsp;concerned with a perfectly competitive market, however,&nbsp;the theory could be extended to allow various market&nbsp;imperfections, which exist in real world. For instance. there&nbsp;may be a single buyer of labour-a 'monopsonist' - where a&nbsp;large factory is the main source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, then the wage rate, (AC<sub>L</sub>) is no longer&nbsp;reperesented by a horizontal straight line. Instead the wage&nbsp;rate increases as more labour is employed. Hence, monopsonist&nbsp;will be facing upward sloping market supply curve&nbsp;and in order to recruit additional workersit has to offer a&nbsp;higher wage rate. In such a case, the size of an employer's&nbsp;demand for labour will affect the wage rate This is illustrated&nbsp;in the figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a0eac825d5685c5a1db9095f9c92c73d" alt="" width="321" height="191"><br><br>The marginal cost curve for labour (MC<sub>L</sub>) being above the&nbsp;average cost curve for labour (AC<sub>L</sub>) can be explained by the&nbsp;use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £ 100, 50 workers&nbsp;may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to&nbsp;employ one more worker he or is forced to ofter £ 101, the&nbsp;increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now&nbsp;£ 101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid&nbsp;to the 51 st worker plus £ 1 paid to each of the 50 original&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ&nbsp;where the MC<sub>L</sub> is equal to the MRP<sub>L</sub>, i.e. point A, hence&nbsp;L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate. however, is&nbsp;given by the average cost curve S (AC<sub>L</sub>) and this will be W<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;The overall wage bill to the monopsonist will, therefore, be&nbsp;OW<sub>1</sub>BL<sub>1</sub>. In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony market&nbsp;the wage and numbers being employed would have been&nbsp;W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>respectively.</p>
<p>In telecommunications, the decrease in demand for labour is&nbsp;unlikely to be caused by a decrease in demand for the product.&nbsp;In fact the job losses appear to be the fall out of large&nbsp;investment in capital which might have caused factor&nbsp;substitution in favour of capital.</p>
<p>It appears that the technology in communication is such that&nbsp;labor and capital are substitutable. The firms might have&nbsp;estimated that they can produce some specific amount of&nbsp;output using a relatively small amount of labor and a relatively&nbsp;large amount of capital. The effect on the demand for&nbsp;labor will be the net result of two opposed effects: the&nbsp;substitution effect and the output effect.</p>
<p>The decline in the price of machinery or improvement in&nbsp;technology prompts the firms to substitute machinery for&nbsp;labor. This allows the firm to produce its output at lower&nbsp;cost. So, at the fixed wage rate, smaller quantities of labor&nbsp;are now employed. This substitution effect decreases the&nbsp;demand for labor. In case when firms make large investment&nbsp;as a result of a decrease in the price of machinery, the costs&nbsp;of production might also decline. With lower costs. the firm&nbsp;finds it profitable to produce and sell a greater output. The&nbsp;greater output increases the demand for all resources, including&nbsp;labor. So this output effect increases the demand for&nbsp;labor.</p>
<p>The substitution and output effects are both present when&nbsp;the price of an input changes, but they work in opposite&nbsp;directions. For a decline in the price of capital, the substitution&nbsp;effect decreases the demand for labor and the output&nbsp;effect increases it. The net change in labor demand depends&nbsp;on the relative sizes of the two effects.</p>
<p>Large investment in response to some technological improvements&nbsp;which increase the quality of capital, have the same&nbsp;effect. The better the quality of capital, the greater the&nbsp;productivity of labor used with it and the greater the likelihood&nbsp;of higher wages for those remained employed.</p>
<p>In conclusion we can say that the outcome of large investment&nbsp;on employment of labour and wage rate depends on&nbsp;the net result of substitution and output effect.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 111</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9086</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have monopoly powers and&nbsp;are mining a natural resource.

In practice a monopoly&nbsp;situation can arise when a firm has a dominant position&nbsp;in the market in terms of its market share. BHP Billiton&nbsp;and Rio Tinto have monopoly powers in mining natural&nbsp;resources which might be a cause of concern for many&nbsp;governments of the countries in which they operate.</p>
<p>The classic case against monopoly is that its conduct&nbsp;and performance is undesirable when compared with that&nbsp;of firms in a competitive industry. This can be anlaysed&nbsp;with the help of the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/79c74b7d94e8707e1ba1d7e5c84e4295" alt="" width="447" height="378"><br><br>Figure above compares the profit-maximising position&nbsp;for an industry under monopoly with that under perfect&nbsp;competition. The monopolist will produce MQ at a price&nbsp;of MPd. This is where MC = MR. If the same industry&nbsp;were under perfect competition, it would produce at&nbsp;PCQ and PCPb. This is where industry supply under&nbsp;perfect competition equals industry demand. Thus&nbsp;monopoly produces a lower output and charges a higher&nbsp;price. In doing so the monopolist captures consumer&nbsp;surplus and turns it into abnormal profit. This analysis&nbsp;is based on the assumption that the industry has the&nbsp;same AC and MC curves whether under perfect competition&nbsp;or run as a monopoly. A more detailed analysis&nbsp;of the graph shows that in perfect competition, output&nbsp;is where P = MC that could be argued to be allocatively&nbsp;efficient. Clearly, the monopolist is producing below this&nbsp;level (at only MQ where P &gt; MC). the monopolist can&nbsp;be argued to be producing at less than optimal output&nbsp;and resulting in a welfare loss shown by the triangle x.&nbsp;Hence consumers would be prepared to pay more for&nbsp;additional units than they cost to produce.</p>
<p>Moreover, under monopoly barriers to entry allow profits&nbsp;to remain supernormal even in the long run. The&nbsp;monopolist is not forced to operate at the bottom of the&nbsp;AC curve. The monopolist, however, sheltered by&nbsp;barriers to entry, can still make large profits even if it&nbsp;is not using the most efficient technique.</p>
<p>These abnormal profits of monopolists may be considered&nbsp;as unfair by many but the scale of this problem&nbsp;obviously depends on the size of the monopoly and the&nbsp;degree of its power. The monopoly profits of the village&nbsp;store may seem of little consequence when compared to&nbsp;the profits of a giant national or international company.</p>
<p>Apart from simple monopoly drawbacks multinational&nbsp;monopolies such as BHP Billiton tend to use their&nbsp;economic power to influence government policies in&nbsp;directions unfavorable to the host nations. They are able&nbsp;to extract sizable economic and political concessions from&nbsp;the governments of host countries in the form of excessive&nbsp;protection, tax, rebates, investment allowances, and&nbsp;the cheap provision of factory sites and essential social&nbsp;services. As a result, the private profits of these giant&nbsp;multinational monopolies exceed social benefits.</p>
<p>These firms are also blamed to damage host economies&nbsp;by suppressing domestic entrepreneur- and using their&nbsp;superior knowledge, worldwide contacts, advertising&nbsp;skills, and a range of essential support services to drive&nbsp;out local competitors and inhibit the emergence of smallscale&nbsp;local enterprises.</p>
<p>The rate of extraction of minerals might be another major&nbsp;source of concern for the host governments. In many&nbsp;parts of the world multinational companies are extracting&nbsp;finite resources at such a rapid rate that it questions&nbsp;the long term sustainability of economic prosperity of&nbsp;the host nations.</p>
<p><br>Thus monopolies, operating at such a large scale, is a&nbsp;matter of concern for the governments of the host countries.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 112</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9083</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In 2007 BHP Billiton, a large mining group, made a bid to&nbsp;take over Rio Tinto, the world's third largest mining group.&nbsp;Such a takeover would create the largest producer of copper&nbsp;and aluminium in the world.</p>

From an economist&nbsp;point of view costs is considered in terms of opportunity&nbsp;cost i.e. the best alternative forgone. In the short&nbsp;run total cost is divided into total fixed costs and total&nbsp;variable costs. But in the long run no such distinction&nbsp;exists owing to the varying nature of all different costs.&nbsp;The analysis of cost structure becomes more meaningful&nbsp;with the calculation of average cost. Average cost simply&nbsp;measures cost per unit of output. In the real world&nbsp;per unit cost is an important tool that businesses use&nbsp;in their decision making. Average cost can be measured&nbsp;as:</p>
<p>AC = (Total &nbsp;Cost)/(output)</p>
<p>Total cost (TC) increases as a firm increases its scale of&nbsp;production, but the rate of increase in TC varies which&nbsp;makes AC to first fall and then to rise both in the short&nbsp;and long run.</p>
<p>Expensive investment in acquiring other firms is a long&nbsp;run decision. Thus it must result in expansion of scale&nbsp;of production. The impact of changes in cost structure&nbsp;due to the new investment can be explained on a firm's&nbsp;long run average cost curve. A long run average cost&nbsp;curve (LRAC) shows how per unit cost varies with&nbsp;output on the assumption that the least cost method of&nbsp;production will be chosen for each level of output. lf&nbsp;the firm experiences economies of scale its LRAC curve&nbsp;will fall but if diseconomies of scale predominate, the&nbsp;LRAC curve will rise. If the firm experiences neither&nbsp;economies nor diseconomies of scale, the LRAC curve&nbsp;will be horizontal as shown in the figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b5226b2cdca27cb7a6ffa8cf7f474708" alt="" width="459" height="245"><br><br>ln the figure above, initially an expansion of output over&nbsp;time leads to a reduction in the unit costs. These cost&nbsp;saving benefits are referred to as economies of scale.&nbsp;They occur because the firm's output is rising proportionately&nbsp;faster than the inputs; hence the firm is&nbsp;benefiting from economies of scale. These benefits come&nbsp;in a variety of ways known as technical, marketing,&nbsp;financial, managerial and risk bearing economies.</p>
<p>Firstly the firm gains from technical economies. For&nbsp;instance, as a firm grows in size it may be able to take&nbsp;advantage of increased specialisation. If the firm&nbsp;produces only a small output it may not be possible to&nbsp;employ a worker solely on one process but as the level&nbsp;of production increases workers may be able to&nbsp;specialise, leading to a lowering of the firm's costs.</p>
<p>Firm also gains on marketing its products. For instance,&nbsp;when a firm buys its raw materials in bulk it may obtain&nbsp;preferential terms in the form of a discount, thus reducing&nbsp;the cost of each unit. A large firm may employ&nbsp;specialist buyers whose sole responsibility it is to&nbsp;purchase raw materials at the cheapest price. Administration,&nbsp;advertising, and packaging costs may also be&nbsp;lower for larger companies since they can spread the&nbsp;cost over larger orders. For example, the packaging costs&nbsp;per item for 1 million units is likely to be substantially&nbsp;lower than if 100 items were packaged.</p>
<p>On the financial front larger firms may be able to obtain&nbsp;finance on favourable terms, obtaining loans from financial&nbsp;institutions at lower rates of interest. Banks will be&nbsp;more willing to give loan on preferential terms to a large,&nbsp;well-known company, which can offer more collateral as&nbsp;security for the loan, than it will to a smaller company.</p>
<p>Apart from this large firms normally produce more than&nbsp;one product and are, therefore, in a position to take&nbsp;advantage of economies of scope. Economies of scope&nbsp;refer to the reduction in average total cost (ATC) made&nbsp;possible by a firm increasing the number of different goods it produces. The reason is that the firm is able&nbsp;to take advantage of skilled staff and technology which&nbsp;can be shared by the different goods produced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As seen in Figure above, at a certain level of output the&nbsp;firm's average costs may increase in the long run with&nbsp;the firm experiencing diseconomies of scale. These&nbsp;diseconomies of scale also come in a variety of ways.&nbsp;For instance, as a firm grows in size it will possibly&nbsp;have a larger management team and, unlike a small firm,&nbsp;it will find it difficult to make decisions quickly. This&nbsp;can often be the case where companies have merged and&nbsp;there are two sets of management with different ideas.&nbsp;It may be difficult to coordinate planning, marketing,&nbsp;production and so on, with a resulting increase in the&nbsp;company's cost per unit.</p>
<p><br>Moreover, the workforce may feel remote and alienated&nbsp;from the management. They may find their jobs boring&nbsp;and repetitive, particularly if mass production methods&nbsp;are used, and this may result in low morale and poor&nbsp;motivation. There may be a feeling on the part of the&nbsp;workforce that they are not part of the firm and this&nbsp;may lead to a deterioration in the quality of work&nbsp;undertaken. A 'them and us' situation may also develop&nbsp;between the management and the workforce, possibly&nbsp;resulting in an increase in the number of industrial&nbsp;disputes.</p>
<p>Thus an increase in the scale of production will increase&nbsp;total costs but will not always reduce company's per&nbsp;unit costs.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 113</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9081</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Resources wasted on bottled water</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In developed countries drinking bottled water has become fashionable: the practice of carrying a small bottle&nbsp;of water is very common. However, it costs much more than water from a tap but often cannot be&nbsp;distinguished from such tap water. Some brands contain the same chemicals as tap water which people&nbsp;think they have paid to avoid.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is now a campaign to stop selling bottled water in restaurants and supply only tap water. A spokesman&nbsp;said 'in the UK, in 2006, 3 billion litres of bottled water were sold. They were advertised as 'pure as a&nbsp;mountain stream' or 'cleansed for 2 million years beneath a Siberian glacier'. Buying such water is a vanity.&nbsp;It is flown around the world to the UK from Norway, France, Japan and Fiji. It is bottled in glass that is&nbsp;mostly thrown away and is very heavy to transport. or in plastic that never decomposes. From a restaurant's&nbsp;point of view selling water is almost free money. The profit mark-up is higher than on wine. The New York&nbsp;Ritz-Carlton hotel even has a water list alongside the wine list.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A UK government minister said 'it is morally unacceptable to spend millions of pounds on imported bottled&nbsp;water when we have pure cheap drinking water and when one of the crises facing other countries is the supply&nbsp;of water'.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By contrast in developing countries there is often no tap water 40% of the world's population lack basic&nbsp;sanitation and I billion people do not have safe drinking water.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It would, therefore, be better for everyone and a better use of resources if the developed world stopped&nbsp;spending money on bottled water, drank the safe tap water instead and used the money to improve water&nbsp;supplies in developing countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Environmentalists believe that the packaging, transportation and disposal of bottled water products creates&nbsp;unnecessary carbon dioxide emissions. It has been proposed that the government should introduce taxes to&nbsp;pay for the damage to the environment, either directly on the sale of each bottle of water or on the disposal&nbsp;of the plastic bottle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A spokesperson for the bottled water industry said that critics were forgetting that the industry generated&nbsp;income and that an estimated 20000 jobs depended on the sales of bottled water. In 2007, annual sales in&nbsp;the UK were worth £2 billion.</p>

<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>A rational consumer weighs up the costs and benefits of each additional unit of a good purchased. We can use marginal utility analysis to show how a rational person decides what combination of goods to buy in order to maximize satisfaction. The rule for rational consumer behaviour is known as the equimarginal principle. This states that a consumer will get the highest utility from given level of income when the utility from the last $1 spent on each good is the same.<br><strong><br></strong>Algebraically, this is when:<strong><br></strong>MU<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>c</sub>/P<sub>c</sub>...... = MU<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>n<br></sub>Where a, b, c .... n are the various goods consumed<sub> <br></sub>What we are describing here is the way in which consumers will achieve the best 'value for money' from their purchases.<sub> <br></sub></li>
<li>Utility of a good or service is the satisfaction or pleasure one gets from consuming it. Utility is a subjective term and is therefore difficult to quantify. But the rational consumer buys an additional unit of a certain product when he feels that the value of money paid for it is less or at least the same as the perceived benefits from consuming it. It could be deduced from the article that consumers believe they should buy bottled water because it is fashionable and a current necessity. This suggests that consumers believe that bottled water is better and gives them more satisfaction. This would not make such a purchase an irrational one. They are following their beliefs. However, there is no evidence in the article of maximising satisfaction as there is no real comparison of the satisfaction that the consumers derive from the bottled water against the tap water. Also there is no comparison with the relative prices of the two. Hence there is insufficient information in the article to prove whether consumers act rationally.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Restriction on the sales of bottled water could have a number of effects on the U.K. economy. As stated by a spokesman that 20,000 jobs depended on sales of bottled water and annual sales were worth £2 billion. Thus restriction of sales is likely to bring a substantial decrease in employment and income first in the water bottled industry and then in related industries such as restaurants, which will adversely affect the overall state of the U.K. economy.<br>The U.K. trade balance is likely to improve as the import of bottled water from Norway, France, Japan and Fiji is going to decline. There might be an increase in government tax revenue however it depends on the price elasticity of demand for imported water. There may also be fewer external costs because packaging, transportation and disposal of bottled water involve in carbon dioxide emissions. But that too depends on the success of the measures the U.K. government adopts to restrict bottled water.</li>
<li>The article provides far too many emotive statements than the facts which could not be used to justify government regulation of the water bottled industry. The statements about vanity are subject to morality. The implication that fashionable goods are necessarily wasteful is an opinion. The statements about free money and the notion that the money saved would all go to developing countries are emotive and cannot be used to justify the proposed restrictive measures. Similarly the emphasis on current environmental issues might appeal to the economic managers but only if facts about environmental hazards are convincingly used which have not been given in the article.<br><br>In addition to this one can notify quite a few expressions used in the article suggesting a value judgment&nbsp;rather than a positive analysis. For instance phrases such as 'morally unacceptable' and 'environmentalists believe that bottled water creates unnecessary emissions' and that 'it would be 'better for everyone and a better use of resources' are all value judgment not supported by any quantifiable facts and, therefore, do not provide sufficient economic reasons to impose restrictions.<br><br>However, there are few less emotive and more factual statements such as relatively high cost of bottled water, the level of imports and the excessive profits made by the restaurants serving bottled water. But no statistical evidence is used to prove the point.<br><br>The economic mangers are trained to weigh up any quantifiable costs and benefits of proposed restrictions before making a final decision. But the article seems to be more a wish of an individual not supported by adequate economic reasoning and factual data. The article, therefore, does not provide sufficient factual evidence to justify government regulation of the water bottled industry.</li>

The equilibrium level of national income (NY) is where planned aggregate expenditure (AE) equals total output or real national income. The term AE denotes the total spending on goods and services produced in an economy. It consists of four elements:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Consumer spending (C)<br>•&nbsp; Investment expenditure (I)<br>•&nbsp; government spending (G)<br>•&nbsp; Net expenditure on exports and imports ( X - M),</p>
<p>and is usually represented by means of the following&nbsp;expression: AE = C + I + G + (X - M)</p>
<p>Determination of national income equilibrium can be illustrated through simple Keynesian analysis and is shown as follows:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/64560dec7056853f9d0f6cee0015b2d7" alt="" width="381" height="225"></p>
<p>In the graph above all points along the 45* line are equidistant from both axes therefore they represent expenditure exactly equal to income (Y = E). The AE function intersects the 45* line at point e. Thus we have OY equilibrium level of real NY and there would be no further tendency for NY to change. Hence the equilibrium level of national income occurs where AE equals total output.</p>
<p>Any changes in equilibrium level of NY are the result of changes in planned expenditure (AE). For instance a rise in the amount of AE at each level of NY will increase equilibrium level of NY and a fall in AE will&nbsp;lower equilibrium national income as shown in the graph above.</p>
<p>Changes in planned expenditure are the consequences of changes in all or any of the components of planned expenditure. For instance, if domestic consumers collectively alter their purchases of the nation's real output at each level of income, the entire AE curve shifts. Factors such as changes in real consumer wealth, future expectations, interest rate and credit availability may alter consumer spending. Planned expenditure curve shifts upward when consumers plan to buy more at each possible price level or shifts downward when consumers plan to buy less at each possible price level as depicted in the figure above.</p>
<p>Similarly a decline in the amount of new capital goods desired by the firms, shifts AE curve downward whereas, an increase in the desired amount of investment goods will shift the AE curve upwards bringing about a corresponding change in equilibrium level of NY. The level of planned investment changes due to changes in interest rate, business confidence, government policy and technology.</p>
<p>Also an increase in government purchases of goods and services at each price level will increase AE as long as tax collections and interest rates do not change. In contrast, a reduction in government spending, such as a cut back in order for military hardware, will reduce AE.</p>
<p>The final determinant of AE is net export spending. When foreign consumers increase their purchases of the nation's&nbsp;commodities, the nation's AE curve shifts upward also a fall in imports implies an increase in expenditure on domestic expenditure. The factors, which alter net exports, are primarily national income abroad and exchange rates.</p>
<p>Hence it can be concluded that private investment is not&nbsp;the only determinant of NY however it can be argued&nbsp;that in today's modern economies private investment&nbsp;has an essentially significant role play in determining&nbsp;NY.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of our analysis is that an&nbsp;increase in AE increases equilibrium national income by&nbsp;a multiple of the initial increase in planned expenditure&nbsp;through what is known as multiplier effect. We define&nbsp;multiplier as the ratio of the change in NY to the change&nbsp;in AE. The extent of change in NY can be measured by the following:</p>
<p>K = (change in NY)/(change in injection ) &nbsp;or &nbsp;K = 1/(MPS + MPT + MPM)</p>
<p>To elaborate we assume that the economy is open with government sector and there are unemployed resources. The MPS, MPT and MPM are 0.3, 0.1 and 0.1 respectively&nbsp;and that the firms increase their level of planned investment by $100 million. By applying the formula&nbsp;we can calculate the value of K in this economy and then the resulting change in NY.</p>
<p>2.5 = 1/(0.3 + 0.1 + 0.1) hence, effect on NY is 2.5 times of change in investment i.e. $100 x 2.5 = 250.</p>
<p>So what causes the multiplier effect? The answer is that, any increase in injection into the economy will produce a stream of new incomes through additional spending. For example, if firms to invest more, this will lead to more people being employed and hence more incomes being paid to households. Households will then spend part of this increased income on domestically produced goods (the remainder will be withdrawn). This increased consumption will encourage firms to produce more goods to meet the demand. Firms will thus employ more people and other factors of production. This leads to even more incomes being paid out to households. Consumption will thus increase yet again, and so the process continues.</p>
<p>Since multiplier is not infinite, therefore, an increase in injections would not cause national income to go on rising forever. Each time people receive extra income they will save some of it, pay some of it in taxes and spend some of it on imports. Eventually, as income goes on rising, all the extra injections will have leaked away into the three withdrawals. At that point the multiplier process will have ceased; a new equilibrium Y<sub>2</sub> will have been reached.</p>
<p>In our analysis of simple Keynesian theory we are assuming that prices are constant i.e. there is no inflation and hence any increase in income is matched by extra production. So, it is the extra output that this spending generates that we are concerned with. However, the extent to which rise in investment causes a change in real NY depends on the level of employment in the economy. For instance, if the economy is already operating at full employment and no extra resources available to produce output to match with the rising demand for both capital goods and consumer goods then increase in AE results in an increase in price level alone with no change in real NY. Also the multiplier effect becomes weaker with an increase in the rising values of MPS, MPT and MPM.</p>
<p>Finally it can be stated that private investment, although very important, is one of the four major determinants of national income and also the extent to which changes in private investment affects NY is subject to certain conditions.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 115</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9070</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the factors influencing the level of investment&nbsp;in an economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Investment is an important component of national income.&nbsp;It can be undertaken by either the private or the&nbsp;public sectors, and can involve the purchase of new&nbsp;plant and machinery, the building of new houses, factories&nbsp;or schools and the construction of roads and&nbsp;reservoirs. Net additions to stocks of raw materials, semifinished&nbsp;and finished goods are also classed as investment.&nbsp;Note that investment is not the buying and selling&nbsp;of stocks and shares or the placing of money in a bank&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between net investment&nbsp;and replacement investment. The former increases capital&nbsp;stock and the latter simply maintains capital stock.&nbsp;The two together constitute gross investment.&nbsp;The decision taken by private firms to invest is likely&nbsp;to be based on different criteria to those of the public&nbsp;sector. Profit is an important factor in private sector&nbsp;investment, whereas public sector investment can be a&nbsp;political or social decision.</p>
<p>When a private firm purchases a new machine, the expectation&nbsp;is that the yield from the investment will be&nbsp;greater than the cost of buying machine. The expected&nbsp;yield is difficult to calculate since it will occur over a&nbsp;number of years. Also, a given sum of money received&nbsp;next year will be worth less than the same sum received&nbsp;now. Therefore, it is usual to discount these yields to&nbsp;their present value and to express the return over the&nbsp;initial cost as a rate. This rate will be referred to as the&nbsp;marginal efficiency capital (MEC). Thus if the MEC is&nbsp;greater than the real rate of interest the investment should&nbsp;precede. The relationship between MEC and rate of&nbsp;interest is illustrated in the figure below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/2aacae17fe95047add20692a6bedaad2" alt="" width="419" height="249"><br><br>By investing, a firm can build up a stock of capital&nbsp;goods and, as with labour, capital is subject to the law&nbsp;of diminishing returns so the MEC will fall. So long as&nbsp;the MEC is greater than the rate of interest, the investment&nbsp;is worthwhile. In figure above, investment should&nbsp;cease once k<sub>1</sub> is reached at an interest rate r<sub>1.&nbsp;</sub>A fall in&nbsp;the rate of interest to r<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>will lead to a rise in the capital&nbsp;stock from k<sub>1</sub> to k<sub>2</sub>. The increase in capital stock,&nbsp;k<sub>2</sub> - k<sub>1</sub>,<sub>&nbsp;</sub>will require new investment to take place.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;size of the capital stock, therefore, varies with the rate&nbsp;of interest.</p>
<p>ln our explanation above, the rate of interest was assumed&nbsp;to be the rate at which firms have to borrow&nbsp;money. However, a large part of investment by firms is&nbsp;financed from retained profit. This does not alter the&nbsp;relationship between the rate of interest and investment.&nbsp;Thus, the higher the rate of interest on savings, the higher&nbsp;the opportunity cost of investment and hence the lower&nbsp;will be the amount of planned investment in the&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>Although rate of interest is the main factor, influencing&nbsp;investment but several other factors can also lead to a&nbsp;change in investment. The other factors include the firm's&nbsp;expectations of the future economic climate, and business&nbsp;confidence mostly influenced by a change in technology,&nbsp;a change in cost of capital, a change in government&nbsp;or its policies, and more importantly the rumors&nbsp;of an increase in the rate of interest.</p>
<p>In the preceding analysis we assumed that investment&nbsp;was autonomous. This is an assumption, which we now&nbsp;relax, with investment being partly induced. This means&nbsp;that investment is related to national income.</p>
<p>For instance, when consumer demand increases, this can&nbsp;have an effect on investment. The rate of change of&nbsp;national income will thus bring about changes in the&nbsp;level of net investment through what is called the accelerator&nbsp;principle.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 116</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9065</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In some countries the rate of unemployment has remained&nbsp;low for several years.</p>

In addition to these governments&nbsp;also aim at achieving high degree of efficiency in the use&nbsp;of nation's scarce resources and a fairly acceptable level&nbsp;of distribution of income and wealth. Though not all&nbsp;governments will share these objectives, yet it is also&nbsp;true that there will be trade-offs and potential conflicts&nbsp;between the objectives, and different governments will&nbsp;attach differing priorities to them. The following are the&nbsp;standard government objectives.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low unemployment</strong> <br>It is important to keep unemployment levels as&nbsp;low as possible. High unemployment is expensive&nbsp;for the government and, therefore, for the taxpayer.&nbsp;For every unemployed person, there are two costs&nbsp;to the government. First, the unemployed workers&nbsp;will be entitled to benefit. Secondly, there is the&nbsp;less obvious cost of the loss of tax revenues, both&nbsp;from direct and indirect taxes, which the workers&nbsp;would have paid in work. Then there is the cost to&nbsp;the whole economy as unemployment involves a&nbsp;loss of potential output and hence lower living&nbsp;standard in general. Young unemployed workers may&nbsp;inflict other external costs on the society, crime&nbsp;for example.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Price stability</strong> <br>Control of inflation is important because if inflation&nbsp;gets out of control, the economy stops growing.&nbsp;The authorities are forced to raise interest rates&nbsp;to counter inflation. At higher interest rate consumers&nbsp;stop borrowing to spend and firms also reduce&nbsp;borrowing to invest. Exports become less competitive&nbsp;and the economy may well drop into a recession.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>High but sustainable economic growth</strong> <br>Economic growth is a measure of rate of change of&nbsp;real GDP over a period of time. High rate of growth&nbsp;can be achieved by bringing unemployed resources&nbsp;at work or alternatively, by improving productivity&nbsp;of existing resources. Governments seek to achieve&nbsp;high but sustainable growth rate mainly because it&nbsp;leads to improved living standards and economic&nbsp;stability.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Balance of payments in equilibrium</strong> <br>BOP is a summary of all economic transactions of&nbsp;a country with other nations over one year time&nbsp;period. A persistent BOP deficit initially results in&nbsp;a decline of a nation's foreign currency reserves and&nbsp;a run on its exchange rate. Ultimately, it necessitates&nbsp;borrowing and the country &nbsp;accumulates foreign&nbsp;debts, which have to be repaid with interest&nbsp;in future. The ideal situation represents a position&nbsp;where, at least over a number of years, the nation&nbsp;spends and invests abroad no more than other&nbsp;nations spend or invest in it.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Equity</strong><br>Left to market forces, owners of inputs, who are&nbsp;paid for their services, will receive significantly larger&nbsp;share of the cake of national income and better life&nbsp;chan ces than their retired, unemployed, disabled and&nbsp;underprivileged counterparts. Governments seek to&nbsp;redistribute income through progressive taxation and&nbsp;various transfer payments.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> <br>Any situation in which the unrestrained market system&nbsp;causes too few or too many resources to be&nbsp;allocated to a specific economic activity can be&nbsp;stated as an example of inefficiency such as,&nbsp;spillover effects (externalities) of many economic&nbsp;activities or market forces unable to provide public&nbsp;goods. Governments seek to eliminate inefficiencies&nbsp;to maximize output from scarce resources. <br><br>The nature of these policy objectives is such that&nbsp;they conflict with each other. There exist potential&nbsp;conflicts not only in macro economic objectives but&nbsp;also between macro and micro economic objectives.&nbsp;There are, therefore, possible trade-offs between&nbsp;the key policy objectives and it is rare for any&nbsp;government to be able to meet all its objectives at&nbsp;the same time. Therefore, the government of the&nbsp;present day has to choose from these objectives&nbsp;and try to achieve them on priority basis. The order&nbsp;of priority depends on the current economic situation&nbsp;and the political ends of the government in&nbsp;office. <br><br>The proposed objective in the question is reduction&nbsp;in unemployment. Present political governments,&nbsp;in order to remain politically popular, usually give&nbsp;priority to high growth and low unemployment in&nbsp;pair. But the problem arises when reduction in unemployment&nbsp;prove to be inflationary and worsen&nbsp;balance of payments. The situation becomes more&nbsp;complex when high growth and low unemployment&nbsp;result in net social costs, concentration of market&nbsp;power or possibly widening gap between rich and&nbsp;poor. <br><br>In theory, at least, the choice depends on the current&nbsp;state of the economy. For example, in times of&nbsp;economic recession the priority objectives should&nbsp;be the highest possible growth and lowest unemployment&nbsp;but with maintaining low rate of inflation,&nbsp;sacrificing minimum on balance of payments&nbsp;and keeping environmental hazards to the lowest&nbsp;possible. On the other hand, in times when inflation&nbsp;accelerates, BOP deteriorates and more environmental&nbsp;damages are made, then corrections of&nbsp;these variables, again by sacrificing minimum of&nbsp;growth rate and employment, ought to be the priority&nbsp;of the government. <br>In conclusion, reduction in unemployment should&nbsp;not always be the aim of government. In fact, the&nbsp;authorities may seek to achieve other objectives in&nbsp;different economic situations. But all governments&nbsp;ultimately desire these same objectives in their quest&nbsp;for economic stability.</li>

Unemployment can be expressed&nbsp;as a number or a percentage. Unemployment rate is the&nbsp;percentage of the work force that is unemployed. The&nbsp;work force can be defined as those who are employed&nbsp;and unemployed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The causes of unemployment fall into two broad categories:&nbsp;Equilibrium unemployment (NRU) and disequilibrium&nbsp;unemployment (real wage unemployment). <br>Real wage unemployment or classical unemployment is&nbsp;where trade unions use their monopoly power to derive&nbsp;wages above the market clearing level resulting in an&nbsp;excess supply of labour. Governments introducing minimum&nbsp;wage legislation could also cause it.</p>
<p>Even when there is no general disequilibrium in the&nbsp;economy at the current wage levels, there will still be&nbsp;some unemployment. This is also known as the natural&nbsp;rate of unemployment. For various reasons not all vacancies&nbsp;will be filled. The problem is one of the mismatching.&nbsp;There are various types of equilibrium unemployment.</p>
<p>Frictional unemployment is transitional unemployment&nbsp;due to people moving between jobs. For example, newly&nbsp;redundant workers or workers entering the labour market, for instance, university graduates may take time to&nbsp;find appropriate jobs at wage rates they are prepared&nbsp;to accept. Thus, many are unemployed for a short time&nbsp;whilst involved in job search. Imperfect information in&nbsp;the labour market may make frictional unemployment&nbsp;worse if the jobless are unaware of the available employment&nbsp;opportunities.</p>
<p>Structural unemployment arises from changes in the&nbsp;pattern of demand or supply in the economy. People&nbsp;made redundant in one part of the economy due to a&nbsp;long run decline in demand in particular industries cannot&nbsp;immediately take up jobs in other parts or other&nbsp;industries. Hence, structural unemployment exists where&nbsp;there is a mismatch between their skills and the requirements&nbsp;of the new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for&nbsp;certain types of labour fluctuates with the seasons of&nbsp;the year. For instance, employment in fruit picking and&nbsp;holiday catering is seasonal in character. The difficulty&nbsp;is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are&nbsp;not substitutable.</p>
<p>Keynesian unemployment is referred to as demand&nbsp;deficient or cyclical unemployment. The term cyclical&nbsp;unemployment entails the alternate booms and slumps&nbsp;in the level of economic activity due to the fluctuations&nbsp;in aggregate demand. Unemployment increases when&nbsp;aggregate demand is too small, there being a deficiency&nbsp;of demand for goods and services. Since labour is a&nbsp;derived demand, the lack of demand for goods and services&nbsp;will also lead to a deficiency of demand for labour.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 118</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9050</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The economic theory of wages assumes first that there is a&nbsp;perfect market and secondly that the market will reach a&nbsp;stable equilibrium. It therefore has little relevance to a&nbsp;commercial world full of change and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Discuss whether you agree with this opinion.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive&nbsp;labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate&nbsp;is determined by the demand for and supply of labour. Many&nbsp;firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type&nbsp;of labour characterize this type of market. Also, there are&nbsp;numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently&nbsp;supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility&nbsp;and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both&nbsp;firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by&nbsp;summing horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal&nbsp;revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The&nbsp;marginal revenue product, MRP<sub>L</sub>, is the increase in revenue&nbsp;due to employing one more unit of labour. MRP<sub>L</sub> is determined&nbsp;by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour)&nbsp;multiplied by the MR i.e. MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market we assume there is&nbsp;no union; workers compete individually for available jobs.&nbsp;The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward,&nbsp;indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage&nbsp;rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must&nbsp;bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8340d8ef97600a2484b4d839a9418d37" alt="" width="402" height="178"></p>
<p>In the figure above, both equilibrium wage rate and level of&nbsp;employment are determined by the intersection of the market&nbsp;demand and supply curves as depicted in the left panel&nbsp;of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to&nbsp;hire this type of labor up to the point at which its marginal&nbsp;revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is equal to marginal cost of labour&nbsp;(MC<sub>L</sub>) shown in the right panel of the graph. At a wage rate&nbsp;above W there is an excess quantity of workers supplied and&nbsp;at a wage rate below W there exists a shortage of workers.&nbsp;A mismatch between QD and QS forces the wage rate to&nbsp;equilibrium position.</p>
<p>The theory further assumes that changes in market forces&nbsp;will eventually restore a stable equilibrium at a new wage&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>Although economic theory of wage determination assumes a&nbsp;perfectly competitive labour market and commodity market&nbsp;with a stable equilibrium, however, the theory could be&nbsp;extended to allow various market imperfections, which exist&nbsp;in real world. For instance, there may be a single buyer of&nbsp;labour -a 'monopsonist'- where a large factory is the main&nbsp;source of employment in a locality. If this is the case, then&nbsp;the wage rate (AC<sub>L</sub>) is no longer reperesented by a horizontal&nbsp;straight line and hence there is no stable equilibrium in&nbsp;the labour market. Instead the wage rate increases as more&nbsp;labour is employed. Hence, monopsonist faces an upward&nbsp;sloping market supply curve and in order to recruit additional&nbsp;workers the monopsonist must offer a higher wage rate. In such a case, the size of an employer's demand for&nbsp;labour will affect the wage rate as illustrated in the figure&nbsp;below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1e233b1cce21fcf452da0c85ee62c960" alt="" width="358" height="214"></p>
<p>The marginal cost curve for labour (MC<sub>L</sub>) being above the&nbsp;average cost curve for labour (AC<sub>L</sub>) can be explained by the&nbsp;use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £100, 50 workers&nbsp;may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to&nbsp;employ one more worker he is forced to offer £ 101, the&nbsp;increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now &nbsp;£101 but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid&nbsp;to the 51 st worker plus £ 1 paid to each of the 50 original&nbsp;workers.</p>
<p>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ&nbsp;where the MC<sub>L</sub> is equal to the MRP<sub>L</sub>,&nbsp;i.e. point A, hence&nbsp;L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate, however, is&nbsp;given by the average cost curve S (AC<sub>L</sub>) and this will be W<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;The overall wage bill to the monopsonist will, therefore, be&nbsp;OW<sub>1</sub>BL<sub>1</sub>. In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony market&nbsp;the wage and numbers being employed would have been&nbsp;W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>respectively.</p>
<p>The analysis of economic theory of wage determination could&nbsp;be further extended to allow the presence of trade unions. Trade unions seek to increase the wage rate of their members&nbsp;by either restricting the supply of labour or by direct negotiation.&nbsp;Collective bargaining involves wage negotiation&nbsp;between trade unions, acting on behalf of their members, and&nbsp;the employers. Successful bargaining could raise the wage&nbsp;rate, for instance, from Wm to Wu, as shown in the figure&nbsp;below. Suppose a strong industrial union is formed by the&nbsp;workers. In other words the union is a monopolistic seller&nbsp;of labur supply and can influence wage rates, but it faces a&nbsp;monopsonistic employer of labour who can also affect wages&nbsp;by altering its employment. The result is bilateral monopoly.&nbsp;This situation is shown in the fig. below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e1cb51c5181aca8bf0d48ccc0b824bf7" alt="" width="370" height="262"></p>
<p>The monopsonist will seek the below-competitive-equilibrium&nbsp;wage rate such as Wm and the union will press for&nbsp;some above-competitive-equilibrium wage rate such as Wu.&nbsp;The outcome is indeterminate since economic theory does&nbsp;not explain what the resulting wage rate is. In fact we should&nbsp;expect the wage outcome to lie somewhere between Wm and&nbsp;Wu. All we can predict is that the party with the most&nbsp;bargaining strategy will be able to get its opponent to agree&nbsp;to a wage close to the one it seeks.</p>
<p>The bargaining strength of trade unions when dealing with&nbsp;employers depends on a number of factors. For instance, a&nbsp;trade union enjoys better bargaining position when it is not&nbsp;easy for employer to substitute labour with capital or the&nbsp;elasticity of demand for the product that the firm produces&nbsp;is relatively low. Also, the low proportion of labour costs&nbsp;to the total costs, majority of the workers belonging to the&nbsp;union and most importantly suitable political and economic&nbsp;climate all add to their bargaining strength. On the other hand&nbsp;high price elasticity of demand for the product, possibility&nbsp;of labour substitution with capital, high proportion of labour&nbsp;costs to total cost , low profits and a period of high unemployment&nbsp;will weaken their power.</p>
<p>To sum up, the conclusion drawn on the basis of economic&nbsp;theory of wage determination is that it has more than little&nbsp;relevance to the real dynamic commercial world. In fact the&nbsp;theory needs to be modified to allow various market imperfections&nbsp;such as monopsony and trade unions, but the extent&nbsp;to which changes have to be made is subject to the collective&nbsp;bargaining strength of trade unions and the monopsonist&nbsp;employer.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 119</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9041</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In India the post is delivered partly by private courier firms&nbsp;and partly by the government-owned India Post.

It occurs when society is using its&nbsp;scarce resources to produce the highest possible amount&nbsp;of goods and services. Economic efficiency entails&nbsp;allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when&nbsp;right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce&nbsp;right products. In other words allocative efficiency&nbsp;occurs when the value that consumers place on a good&nbsp;or service (price) equals the cost of the resources (marginal&nbsp;cost) used up in production. The technical condition&nbsp;required for allocative efficiency is that price =&nbsp;marginal cost. When this happens economic welfare&nbsp;measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus&nbsp;is maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f82d2e7111a0dc25c46c72cbfa99244c" alt="" width="306" height="227"></p>
<p>Situations where either P &gt; MC or PMC indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve perfect allocation whereas P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have been allocated for the production of particular products.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production&nbsp;and can be applied both to the short run and longrun. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize&nbsp;the wastage of resources in their production process&nbsp;and is achieved when the output is produced at&nbsp;minimum average total cost (ATC).</p>
<p>For an optimal allocation of resources productive efficiency&nbsp;is a necessary but insufficient condition. For&nbsp;instance there is little point in producing items at lowest&nbsp;cost if they are not the products most valued by&nbsp;consumers. Thus allocative efficiency is also required.&nbsp;Finally it can be stated that any point lying on the PPC&nbsp;is productively efficient however any point on PPC is&nbsp;possibly efficient in terms of allocation of resources.</p>
<p>A failure of the free market and the price mechanism to&nbsp;deliver an allocatively efficient allocation of scarce resources&nbsp;is normally regarded as justification for some&nbsp;form of government involvement in the economy. This&nbsp;involvement is designed to correct market failure and&nbsp;achieve an improvement in economic and social welfare.&nbsp;Hence the quest for efficiency provides rationales for&nbsp;increasing government control of inefficient organizations.&nbsp;Government can intervene by introducing competition&nbsp;policy or alternatively public ownership or economic&nbsp;regulation of privately owned firms can be used.</p>
<p>A simple efficiency analysis of a perfectly competitive&nbsp;market and a monopoly is useful in determining the role&nbsp;of government. This is illustrated in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2de48cb67108d7fa989beb70b1d9f202" alt="" width="401" height="250"></p>
<p>A perfectly competitive firm produces qo output and&nbsp;would sell this at op. The resulting consumer surplus&nbsp;would be the sum of areas 1, 4 and 5. When the industry&nbsp;is monopolized, price rises to pm and consumer surplus&nbsp;falls to area 5. Area 4 is surplus that is transferred from&nbsp;consumers to monopolist due to rise in price whereas&nbsp;area 1 and 2 are lost altogether and represent deadweight&nbsp;loss resulting from monopoly and account for its&nbsp;allocative inefficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, survival of a firm in the long run under perfect&nbsp;competition requires that it uses the most efficient combination of inputs and techniques. The monopolist&nbsp;however, sheltered by barriers to entry, can still make&nbsp;large profits even if it is not using the least cost combination&nbsp;of inputs.</p>
<p>The analysis above clearly illustrates that perfect competition&nbsp;is efficient and that monopoly, in general is&nbsp;not. However it is important to emphasize that perfect&nbsp;competition is a theoretical ideal and is not even closely resembled in most real world markets. Hence there are&nbsp;many circumstances in which there is room for government&nbsp;intervention in order to increase the efficiency of market outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clearest case is of natural monopoly - an industry in which scale effects are so dominant that there is room&nbsp;for at most one firm to operate at the minimum efficient&nbsp;scale. They are found mainly in public utilities, such as&nbsp;electricity transmission, cable television and local telephone services. It is argued that such industries must be controlled or regulated by government to reduce inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Whether the government owns or merely regulates such organizations the pricing policy is determined by the&nbsp;government. The firms are typically required to follow&nbsp;a pricing policy that conflicts with their goal of profit maximization. When government dictates that the dominant&nbsp;organizations set prices equal to marginal cost. In&nbsp;principle atleast marginal cost pricing induces the allocatively efficient level of output. However, it is&nbsp;difficult to regulate the firms as marginal cost cannot be&nbsp;measured with precision. Also a natural monopoly, when producing the allocatively efficient level of output, may&nbsp;be operating on the downward sloping portion of its&nbsp;ATC curve. Consequently price will be less than average total cost leading to productive inefficiency. Similarly&nbsp;if the firm operates where firms ATC curve is below its MC curve marginal cost pricing will lead to productive inefficiency as price is higher than per unit cost.</p>
<p>Alternatively, as part of competition policy, government&nbsp;can prevent the merger of companies that would potentially lead to one large organization that is likely to dominate the market or else government can remove any artificial barriers that have allowed certain firms to&nbsp;dominate the market.</p>
<p>However the critics argue that government intervention does not always improve efficiency. They believe that the pursuit of self interest, limited information and tendency to look for quick fixes among politicians can result in a further loss of allocative and productive efficiency. Even with good intentions governments seldom get their policy application correct. They can tax, control and&nbsp;regulate but the eventual outcome may be a deepening of the market failure or even worse a new failure may arise.</p>
<p>In conclusion a well thought-out government involvement may improve allocative efficiency in certain industries but it is difficult to calculate with precision. But government involvement is less likely to improve productive&nbsp;efficiency, particularly in industries where unprofitable services are provided.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 120</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9031</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In India the post is delivered partly by private courier firms&nbsp;and partly by the government-owned India Post.

The free market works through&nbsp;price signals. Day to day, the free market mechanism&nbsp;remains a tremendously powerful device for determining&nbsp;how resources are allocated among competing ends.</p>
<p>However the government may choose to increase its&nbsp;control over private firms largely on the grounds of&nbsp;wanting to change the allocation of resources and achieve&nbsp;what they perceive to be an improvement in economic&nbsp;and social welfare.</p>
<p>The main reasons for increasing control by the government&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; To correct for market failure.<br>•&nbsp; To achieve a more equitable distribution of income&nbsp;and wealth.<br>•&nbsp; To improve the performance of the economy.</p>
<p>Market failure is when free market forces fail to allocate&nbsp;scarce resources efficiently. It often results from&nbsp;consumers suffering from a lack of information about&nbsp;the costs and benefits of the products available in the&nbsp;market place. Government action can have a role in&nbsp;improving information to help consumers and producers&nbsp;value the 'true' cost and/or benefit of a good or service.&nbsp;For instance, compulsory labelling on cigarette packages&nbsp;with health warnings to reduce smoking or improved&nbsp;nutritional information on foods to counter the risks of&nbsp;growing obesity.</p>
<p>These controls are designed to change the "perceived"&nbsp;costs and benefits of consumption for the consumer.&nbsp;They don't have any direct effect on market prices, but&nbsp;they seek to influence "demand" and therefore output&nbsp;and consumption in the long run.</p>
<p>Some industries may require a more direct control&nbsp;because these industries may create substantial external&nbsp;benefits and costs. For instance, an unprofitable railway&nbsp;line may ease congestion on roads or a coal-fired power&nbsp;stations may pollute the atmosphere and cause acid rain.&nbsp;If these industries are controlled by government, the&nbsp;decision making will take account of externalities and&nbsp;hence improve social efficiency. Also some industries&nbsp;require extensive planning and coordination to avoid&nbsp;wasteful usage of scares resources. For instance&nbsp;decisions in the coal, electricity, gas and oil require&nbsp;coordination in order to optimize the use of these&nbsp;exhaustible resources. Government control of these&nbsp;industries will ensure that effective coordination is maintained&nbsp;and the decisions are made in public interest.</p>
<p>Government control is desirable when market power is&nbsp;concentrated in a small number of firms. In these situations&nbsp;markets are not operating efficiently because firms&nbsp;abuse their market power. For instance, the dominant&nbsp;firm or group of firms, well aware of their market power,&nbsp;might charge prices that are considerably higher than the&nbsp;marginal cost of production. This leads to an allocatively&nbsp;inefficient use ofresources. Price is also unlikely to equal&nbsp;minimum average cost, which leads to productive inefficiency.&nbsp;Furthermore, dominant firm may also exploit&nbsp;consumers by offering poor quality product or alternatively&nbsp;may use bundling in which case consumers must&nbsp;buy other products that are associated with their main&nbsp;product. Government can use standards and regulation&nbsp;or financial intervention in the form of price controls.&nbsp;In some cases government may decide that market&nbsp;efficiency is best achieved if the product is produced by&nbsp;state-owned firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reason of equity certain loss making services could&nbsp;be provided. For instance it could be argued that rural&nbsp;bus services should be kept operating at cross-subsidised&nbsp;prices and that certain needy people should be charged&nbsp;lower prices. This is easier to achieve when the industry&nbsp;is controlled by government. Also at times government&nbsp;may wish to control ailing industries not only to protect&nbsp;jobs in those industries but also in other related industries&nbsp;and in the local community.</p>
<p>Certain other industries&nbsp;such as weapons manufacturing are controlled by&nbsp;governments to ensure that they operate in the interest&nbsp;of the country.</p>
<p>Lastly, government may wish to hold certain key industries&nbsp;under control in order to make it easier to manage&nbsp;the economy. For instance, governments could attempt&nbsp;to restrain wages and keep the price increase small as&nbsp;a way of controlling inflation.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 121</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9019</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how a knowledge of its long-run average costs&nbsp;might be useful to a profit-maximising firm.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The long run is defined as a time period during which&nbsp;full adjustment can be made to any change in the economic&nbsp;environment i.e. in the long run all factors of&nbsp;production are variable and as a result the firm can alter&nbsp;its plant size. Consequently, there may be many short&nbsp;run cost curves, indicating different plant sizes, but only&nbsp;one long run curve as a firm develops over the years.&nbsp;Long run average cost curve (LRAC) shows the lowest&nbsp;cost of producing any output when all factors are variable.&nbsp;The LRAC curve sometimes is called an envelop&nbsp;because it encloses a series of short run average cost&nbsp;curves by being tangent to them as shown in the graph&nbsp;below.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/977614d6be88ac7dc2841c1916565b25" alt="" width="621" height="288"><br><br>Each short-run curve shows how costs vary if output&nbsp;changes, with the fixed factor held constant.</p>
<p>The LRAC curve is made up of all the points of&nbsp;tangency of the given number of SRAC curves from&nbsp;which the LRAC curve is derived.</p>
<p>It is often assumed that as a firm expands, it will&nbsp;initially experience various types of economies of scale&nbsp;and thus faces a downward sloping LRAC curve. For&nbsp;instance, the firm can introduce more division of labour&nbsp;and specialization as it increases its size. A large firm&nbsp;buys raw material in bulk it may obtain it on preferential&nbsp;terms. In addition, larger firms may be able to obtain&nbsp;finance on favourable terms, thus reducing the cost of&nbsp;each unit.</p>
<p>After a point when such economies have been achieved,&nbsp;LRAC curve will flatten out. Further expansion results&nbsp;in firm being so large that it will start experiencing&nbsp;diseconomies of scale and hence faces a rising LRAC.&nbsp;At this stage, production and financial economies will&nbsp;begin to be offset by the managerial problems of running&nbsp;a giant organization. The effect of this is to give a saucer&nbsp;shaped curve as shown in the figure above.</p>
<p>In the graph above the firm's long run per unit cost of&nbsp;production is at a minimum when output is OQ. This&nbsp;is known as the optimum size of the firm i.e. the most&nbsp;efficient size.</p>
<p>To clarify this suppose there are many choices of plant&nbsp;sizes, each of which has a short run average cost curve.&nbsp;Also, the firm wants to produce output Q<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;If it builds&nbsp;a small plant, the SRAC<sub>1</sub> is relevant, so that the average&nbsp;cost of production is Od as opposed to Oa on the medium&nbsp;sized plant (indicated by SRAC). Hence, a small plant&nbsp;is a better choice than a medium sized plant. Now&nbsp;consider the case when firm wants to produce Q<sub>2</sub> ouput.&nbsp;The medium sized plant (indicated by SRAC<sub>2</sub>) is more&nbsp;cost effective than a relatively smaller plant (indicated&nbsp;by SRAC<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p>Thus, the knowledge of LRAC might be useful to a&nbsp;profit-maximizing firm in terms of choosing the most&nbsp;efficient plant size. In addition, LRAC indicates the&nbsp;minimum efficient scale (MES), which is the lowest level&nbsp;of output at which a firm can minimize LRAC and by&nbsp;reaching MES the firm can become more efficient than&nbsp;other small firms. Most importantly, the firm knows&nbsp;the optimum size and can retain its scale to avoid&nbsp;diseconomies of scale.</p>
<p>Thus it can be stated that knowledge of LRAC helps&nbsp;firm to decide about the scale at which it must operate&nbsp;in order to maximize profit.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 122</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9017</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Economic analysis of resource allocation assumes consumers&nbsp;are rational.

Throughout the economy, millions of consumers are&nbsp;making decisions of what to purchase. For instance, by&nbsp;changing their preferences from good A to good B they are sending the signal to the producers of these goods. As the&nbsp;demand for good B increases and that of good A declines the&nbsp;prices of these goods will change and other things being equal, the profit obtained from the two products will change. Profit&nbsp;is the key motivator for producers and therefore, they will&nbsp;reallocate resources to those goods and services which will&nbsp;yield the most profit.</p>
<p>The consumers have an important role to play in the market for it has been their change in taste and preferences, which ultimately results in a change in what is produced. Hence, according to economic theory, consumers indicate their wishes, through changes in demand, and community's productive resources are allocated accordingly. So right amount of resources is allocated to produce the right products.</p>
<p>As consumers if we had unlimited income, we could consume as much as we wanted. We would not have to be careful with our money. In the real world, however, given the problem of scarcity, we have to make choices about what to buy. For instance, you may have to choose between the new books you feel you ought to buy and going to a rock concert, between a new pair of jeans and a meal out, and so on. It is here that economic theory assumes that consumers behave 'rationally'. We define rational choices as the weighing-up of the costs and benefits of our actions. As far as consumption is concerned, rational action involves considering the relative costs and benefits to us of the alternatives we could spend our money on. We do this in order to gain the maximum satisfaction possible from our limited incomes.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may act 'irrationally'. We may purchase goods impetuously or out of habit, with little thought to their price or quality. In general, however, it is a reasonably accurate assumption that people behave rationally. In other words, consumers learn over time the sort of products they like and therefore, they can probably make out a 'rational' shopping list for themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the major aim of advertising is to sell the product. This can be achieved not only by informing the consumer of the product's existence and availability, but also by deliberately trying to persuade consumers to purchase the goods. Consumers need information about product characteristics and prices to make rational decisions. Advertising can be a low-cost means of providing that information.</p>
<p>The assertion in the question actually implies that much advertising is designed to manipulate or persuade consumers, that is, to alter their preferences in favor of the advertiser's product. For instance, a television commercial indicating that a popular personality drinks a particular brand of soft drink and therefore that you should conveys little or no information to consumers about price or quality. Therefore,&nbsp;it encourages irrational consumption and influences allocation of resources. To counter this view economists argue that consumers buy what they desire for or at least what they are made to think they crave for through advertisement. As long as they buy commodities which they feel will satisfy their craving they act rationally.</p>
<p>In particular, with major items of expenditure such as a house, a car, a carpet or a foreign holiday, we are likely to take much more care. Take the case of a foreign holiday: you will probably spend quite a long time browsing through brochures comparing the relative merits of various holiday packages against their relative costs, looking for a holiday that gives good value for money. This is a rational behaviour.</p>
<p>But it may not turn out to be nearly as good as the brochure led you to believe. This is a problem of ignorance. You probably nevertheless behaved rationally in the first place, believing that you were getting value for money. We, therefore, must not confuse irrationality and ignorance. The assumption that consumers behave rationally does not mean&nbsp;that they have perfect information.</p>
<p>Also, the term 'rational' simply refers to behaviour that is&nbsp;consistent with consumers' own particular goals, i.e. behaviour directed to getting the most out of their limited income. People may well disapprove of the things that others buy - their clothes, their records, their cigarettes, but that is making a judgement about their goals: their taste and morality. Economic theory does not make judgement about what people's goal should be instead we use them to analyse the implications of people behaving rationally in pursuit of these goals.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be concluded that advertisement does not mean a decrease in rationality and hence misallocation of resources. In fact, advertisement through better information make informed choices more likely.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 123</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9016</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>At a time when there has been rapid economic growth in some parts of the world, there are many countries&nbsp;in Africa in which severe poverty and infectious diseases are still widespread.</p>

<p>Economic growth in the last 50 years has occurred at the same time as a widening gap both between rich&nbsp;and poor people in a country and between rich and poor countries.

<li>In general, economic growth is the increase in an economy's level of real output (GDP) over time.&nbsp;Economists often distinguish between actual and potential growth. Actual economic growth is achieved&nbsp;by simply utilizing existing spare capacity therefore, is more short term in nature. In contrast,&nbsp;potential growth is achieved by enlarging productive capacity, which is a long-run process. A distinction&nbsp;therefore needs to be drawn between a shorter-term recovery phase based on existing resources&nbsp;and a long-term shift in a nation's potential output.</li>
<li>Developed world is the economically advanced countries whereas developing countries are characterized&nbsp;by low levels of living, high rates of population growth, low income per capita and general&nbsp;economic and technological dependence on developed economies.<br><br>Both developed and developing countries are somewhat dependent on each other in terms of achieving&nbsp;growth. There is, therefore, a two-way link, which is supposed to help both types of economies.&nbsp;Developed countries attract much needed resources such as financial, human and other natural resources&nbsp;from developing countries to maintain their growth momentum. Hence, use of resources by&nbsp;the developed nations generates valuable incomes for developing nations while causing rise in production&nbsp;and growth in developed countries. <br><br>On the other hand, developed countries give aid to developing nations that can help finance investment&nbsp;projects and improve inflow of foreign exchange. Thus, aid enables these nations to import&nbsp;expensive foreign capital from developed nation considered necessary for economic growth. Usually&nbsp;a large part of aid come in the form of technical assistance to ensure that the capital is efficiently&nbsp;used and necessary infrastructure is developed to stimulate growth in developing countries. Hence,&nbsp;aid encourages development and as a result products may be available for developed nations to&nbsp;import. <br>Finally, it can be asserted that development and growth achieved through aid in developing countries,&nbsp;increases the volume of global trade and benefits all due to the world multiplier effect.</li>
<li>The figure portrays income distribution in percentages of both population and income. The data in&nbsp;absolute values would have reflected a more vivid picture. Furthermore, the proper criterion of&nbsp;poverty has not been established in the text. Economists are skeptical about the implied criterion&nbsp;of less than $2 a day as defining poverty. It is subject to value judgment and thus debatable. Moreover,&nbsp;the source of data has not been mentioned that undermines its validity. Also, the statement includes&nbsp;the word 'still' that suggests comparison with some past data but no comparative figures have been&nbsp;quoted in the text in order to substantiate the word.<br><br>Thus, it can be stated that there is no real proof from the chart to enable the conclusion in the&nbsp;information to be drawn. However, the statement might be true as the percentage distribution on the&nbsp;chart does confirm the expected uneven distribution of income prevailing in the world but the accuracy&nbsp;of the percentages is questionable.</li>
<li>There is indecisive evidence in the text to arrive at the conclusion that there is weakness in the&nbsp;argument that economic growth is a solution to poverty. Recent empirical data suggests that with&nbsp;appropriate policies, the poor can participate in growth and when they do so, rapid declines in&nbsp;poverty are consistent with economic growth. For instance, China has experienced the highest growth&nbsp;rate in the world and also the most dramatic reduction in poverty. Also, many of today's developed&nbsp;nations, once plagued with widespread poverty, have been able to reduce poverty by achieving high&nbsp;growth rate. In addition, many developing nations have been able to reduce poverty, which would&nbsp;have been much higher had these countries not grown rapidly. Although, poverty still exists both&nbsp;in developed and in developing countries; it might have been worse without growth.<br><br>The statement is not supported by relevant data, however, the information about $2 a day give some&nbsp;weight to the argument but it might be misleading as it does riot account for differing cost of living&nbsp;in various parts of the world. Less than $2 a day in purchasing power dollars might have been a&nbsp;more acceptable measure of poverty.<br><br>Finally, it can be asserted that alone from the evidence provided in the text the conclusion drawn&nbsp;is not necessarily correct. According to many, the acceptable criterion of measuring poverty is the&nbsp;number of people who are unable to command sufficient resources to satisfy basic needs.</li>

The reality is that all governments&nbsp;intervene through policies in a bid to achieve certain&nbsp;policy objectives and improve the performance of the&nbsp;economy and hence lives of the people.<br>Policy goals are the ultimate aims, challenges and objectives&nbsp;of government. The main macro economic objectives are:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Sustained economic growth<br>•&nbsp; High employment<br>•&nbsp; Stable prices (low inflation)<br>•&nbsp; Sustainable position on the balance of payments</p>
<p>In addition to this there are two micro economic objectives:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Efficiency<br>•&nbsp; Equity</p>
<p>It is rare for any government to be able to meet all its&nbsp;objectives at the same time. The complexity of the economy&nbsp;and the limitations of economic policies make this a really&nbsp;tough task. The nature of these policy objectives is such&nbsp;that they conflict with each other. There exist potential&nbsp;conflicts not only within macro economic objectives but also&nbsp;between macro and micro economic objectives. There are,&nbsp;therefore, possible trade-offs between the key policy objectives.<br>Potential trade-offs between objectives imply that choices&nbsp;between different goals may have to be made in different&nbsp;economic phases that an economy goes through.</p>
<p>Governments are thus faced with a dilemma. If they reflate&nbsp;the economy, they will make two of the macroeconomic&nbsp;objectives better (growth and unemployment), but the other&nbsp;two worse (inflation and the current account of the balance&nbsp;of payments). If they deflate the economy, it is the other&nbsp;way round: inflation and the current account of the balance&nbsp;of payments will improve, but unemployment will rise and&nbsp;growth or even output will fall. This complexity further&nbsp;rises when growth and employment result in higher negative&nbsp;externalities, concentration of market power or possibly&nbsp;widening gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p>One such conflict between inflation and unemployment is&nbsp;illustrated by the famous Philips curve Philips analysed the&nbsp;relationship between changes in money wages (taken as an&nbsp;indicator of inflation) and unemployment. He found an inverse&nbsp;relationship, as shown in figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f05b0d9ed9e0dae49c642ef83a39beb1" alt="" width="369" height="220"><br><br>The traditional Philips curve suggests that a government can&nbsp;select its optimum combination of inflation and unemployment&nbsp;and can trade off the two. For example, if the current&nbsp;unemployment rate is 10 percent and its inflation rate is 3&nbsp;percent, a government may seek to lower unemployment to&nbsp;7 percent by increasing its expenditure whilst accepting this&nbsp;improvement may have to be bought at the cost of higher&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<p>When unemployment falls to low levels or economy achieves&nbsp;high growth rate, there is a risk that wage and price inflation&nbsp;will pick up. The demand for labour is increasing and labour&nbsp;shortages in many industries and occupations may arise. This&nbsp;puts upward pressure on pay as employers offer higher pay&nbsp;both to recruit and retain their key workers.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7c95b6ff2c1a0c524b1e24d9aa3cf95a" alt="" width="341" height="249"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8be1528e85e1e3c4df1b873b1cd54a2f" alt="" width="382" height="249"><br><br>Falling unemployment leads to an increase in AD which can&nbsp;lead to demand pull inflation if SRAS is inelastic. As the&nbsp;economy heads towards full-employment, there is a danger&nbsp;that inflation will accelerate and that economic policy will&nbsp;have to be tightened (for example a rise in taxation or an&nbsp;increase in interest rates). The diagrams above illustrate an&nbsp;outward shift of the demand for labour during an economic&nbsp;boom and an increase in AD from AD1 to AD2 when SRAS&nbsp;is inelastic.</p>
<p>Similarly sustained growth caused by rising aggregate demand&nbsp;can lead to acceleration in inflation as the economy&nbsp;uses up scarce resources and short run aggregate supply&nbsp;becomes inelastic. When SRAS is elastic, an outward shift&nbsp;of aggregate demand can easily be met by a rise in real GDP&nbsp;(there is plenty of spare capacity and supply responds&nbsp;elastically to the higher level of AD). But when SRAS&nbsp;becomes inelastic, the trade-off between growth and inflation&nbsp;worsens - an increase in AD tends to lead to higher prices&nbsp;rather than increased output and employment.</p>
<p>A potential conflict exists between economic growth and trade&nbsp;balance. When aggregate demand is high and domestic producers&nbsp;are unable to meet all of this demand, the demand&nbsp;for imported goods and services will increase leading to an&nbsp;increase in the trade deficit. This trade-off is evident when&nbsp;the main source of rising AD is a high level of consumer&nbsp;spending. Analysis of Pakistani economy, in recent years,&nbsp;shows that the size of the trade deficit is largely cyclical.&nbsp;The strong growth of GDP and consumer demand has led&nbsp;to a large increase in the trade deficit in goods and services.&nbsp;This suggests that if the government wants to reduce the &nbsp;trade deficit, then it must accept that consumer demand (and&nbsp;GDP) eventually grow at a slower rate in order to reduce&nbsp;the imbalance between exports and imports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To counter this swelling trade deficit economists recommend&nbsp;depreciation in the exchange rate It would provide a competitive&nbsp;boost to local producers and might lead to an improvement&nbsp;in our balance of payments. However, a low&nbsp;exchange rate would also lead to an increase in the costs of&nbsp;imported goods and services risking higher "cost-push" inflation.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion we can generalize following&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>Should the highest priority be given to keeping inflation firmly&nbsp;under control? Or can the economy now operate at a higher&nbsp;level of GDP growth and lower unemployment without&nbsp;worrying too much about the inflationary consequences?</p>
<p>or alternatively:</p>
<p>Should the government be concerned about a large and rising&nbsp;trade deficit with other countries? Or can the trade deficit&nbsp;be ignored because it is the result of a high level of short&nbsp;term growth and strong consumer spending?</p>
<p>The government will have to address these questions by&nbsp;setting its priorities. Practically, the objectives are determined&nbsp;by the political ends of the government. But in theory, at&nbsp;least, it depends on the current state of the economy. In a&nbsp;situation of imbalance in macro or micro economic variables,&nbsp;such as inflationary growth or rising employment with increasing&nbsp;trade deficit or economic growth with no trickle&nbsp;down effect to reduce mass poverty, the government is&nbsp;supposed to follow a balancing act in order to minimize the&nbsp;conflicting effects of these issues. For example, in times of&nbsp;economic recession the priority objectives are high growth&nbsp;rate and increase in employment but with maintaining low&nbsp;rate of inflation , sacrificing minimum on its balance of&nbsp;payment and by keeping environmental hazards to the lowest&nbsp;possible. On the other hand in times of high growth&nbsp;when unemployment is low but inflation accelerates, BOP&nbsp;deteriorates and more environmental damages are made, then&nbsp;corrections of these variables, again by sacrificing minimum&nbsp;of growth rate and employment, ought to be the priority of&nbsp;the government.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 125</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9005</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether it is best to use all factors of production as fully as possible.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The scarcity concept stems in part from the existence of finite resources. Resources, typically called factors of production, can be defined as the inputs used in the production of those commodities that we desire. The total quantity, or stock of resources that an economy has determines what and how much the economy is capable to produce.<br>These factors of production are classified as land, labour, capital and entrepreneur. Economists use the term 'land' for all natural resources available. Thus it includes mineral deposits, water, climate vegetation etc. Labour consists of productive contributions made by individuals who work, for example, coal miners, construction workers and professional soccer players. Land and labour are combined with manufactured resources in order to produce commodities that we desire. These manufactured resources are called capital, for example, machines, building, tools etc. Entrepreneurship is associated with the founding of new businesses, or the introduction of new product techniques. But it means more than that: it encompasses taking risks, inventing new methods of making existing goods and generally experimenting with any type of new thinking that could lead to a monetary benefit.&nbsp;<br>There are differing opinions on the issue of using these resources to the fullest. The more popular notion among economists is that a nation must utilise its existing resources to the fullest to achieve maximum economic benefits i.e. production must take place close to PPC if not on the PPC. According to them it brings a number of benefits to society. These include higher living standards and greatest possible prosperity for individuals. It also helps businesses to be profitable, that generates employment and incomes through which lower rates of poverty can be achieved. It boosts the tax revenues flowing into the Treasury and also provides the government with more money to finance projects of economic welfare. <br>Economic affluency also enable countries to allocate more resources to invest in cleaner technologies. Much depends on how many resources an economy is willing to devote to environmental improvement and protection. For example, over the last thirty years, the ratio of energy consumption per unit of GDP has fallen quite significantly. The reduction in energy intensity is a reflection of improvements in production technologies and also a gradual switch towards a low carbon economy. <br>People can expect to live longer and to enjoy an array of new goods and services, including air travel, antibiotics, computers and televisions. Therefore, nations must use their existing resources to the fullest to uplift material well being of their people. <br>On the contrary, this economic prosperity does not come risk-free. Although our material progress can be measured in part by the extent of use of renewable and nonrenewable resources, yet if the economy uses its resources fully, apart from all economic gains, it can bring about short and long-term problems. <br>Production of commodities cannot be separated from its environmental impact. High levels of production and consumption can create negative externalities such as increased noise, air pollution and road congestion. Environmental damage can have a negative effect on our quality of life. For example, road transport is responsible for 25% of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions once emissions from fuel processing and vehicle manufacturing are taken into account. <br>In many parts of the world countries, in order to fully utilise their valuable finite resources, are extracting them at such a rapid rate that it questions the long-term sustainability of their economic prosperity. Renewable resources can also be depleted because of over-consumption. Examples include the destruction of rain forests,the over-exploitation of fish stocks and loss of natural habitat created through the construction of new roads, hotels, retail malls and industrial estates. Some of the main environmental threats include: the depletion of global resource base and the impact of global warming. There are plenty of examples around of the "tragedy of the commons", the permanent loss of what should be renewable resources that result from over-extraction of some of our environmental resources, for example, species extinction may lead to a loss of bio-diversity .<br>In conclusion, nations must not get excited by the idea of using all their resources to the fullest in order to gain maximum economic benefits. The analysis of the extent to which resources should be used must include the opportunity cost of using both renewable and non renewable resources at present and also in future. We need to make sure that non-renewable resources are used efficiently along with their maximum possible conservation for future generations and that alternatives are also developed to replace them in due course. Renewable resources, such as water, should be used in ways that do not endanger the resource or cause serious damage or pollution. <br>Hence a prudent evaluation of costs and benefits to the society will enable nations to set their constraints and optimize economic gains within those constraints.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 126</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9004</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why there might be rapid economic growth in a country.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The long run expansion of an economy' s productive potential is known as potential growth. Whereas the percentage annual increase in a country's real GDP is actual growth.</p>
<p>Long term potential growth is achieved by increased supply and improvement in productivity of factor inputs, increase in capital stock, improvement in technology and exploitation of new finds of natural resources.</p>
<p>Short term growth in GDP is determined by the rate of growth in aggregate demand. When aggregate demand rises in an economy it uses up the existing capacity, thus, manages to increase its GDP by reducing unemployment.</p>
<p>An increase in aggregate demand is the result of higher consumer spending, increased capital investment, a rise in government spending on goods and services and increase in net export (X-M).</p>
<p>Both these effects can be illustrated on a production possibility diagram.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2e1758d004bf21d33515da784b918a71" alt="" width="281" height="212"></p>
<p>The PPC itself shows potential out put, therefore, potential growth, then, is illustrated by a shift outward of the curve, for example, curve 1 to curve 2. Actual growth is represented by a movement towards PPC, for example, point a to point b.</p>
<p>Countries at different stages of economic cycles are likely to register different growth rates . For example, a country going through lean periods will register no or low rate of economic growth, but in different times when the level of economic activities picks up, the same country achieves higher growth rate. In addition, some countries, with effective planning, manage to utilise their natural resources effectively, thus achieve higher growth, others may not be able to use their natural resources as effectively and manage to grow at lower rates.</p>
<p>Increases in the amount of capital goods are called investment. For growth to occur the level of investment has to be greater than the amount of depreciation, i.e. the amount by which machines wear out or become obsolete during the year. The higher the level of investment above depreciation the greater the potential output of the economy in the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources to enable investment have to come from somewhere. The only way that workers can be freed from making cars to build car factories is by an increase in savings by households . i.e. by the postponement of any decision to buy goods today in favour of future consumption. The analysis above gives the traditional PPC model of economic growth. In the diagram below, a country starting with high levels of current consumption will have few resources available for investment. Its PPC will increase only slowly, if at all. A country succeeding in restricting consumption today will have an expanded PPC in the future, and can move to a point of higher consumption.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/76e798948ca35e9ec1d450b2e0678e18" alt="" width="340" height="229"></p>
<p>In the diagram two countnes starting with the same PPC, achieve two very different growth paths. The first country, by consuming less and therefore saving more, has a high degree of investment and moves from A to B. The second country initially consumes more, at C, but this allows a much smaller expansion of the PPC, resulting in less of both consumption and investment in the future at D.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests that a country with high rate of savings achieves a high rate of growth in GDP.</p>
<p>In some countries high growth rate is the result of governments taking up investments themselves, having enforced savings through taxation. An alternative to forced savings is to borrow the necessary funds from other governments or from official aid agencies, paying back the interest from future growth. <br>Economic growth will depend to some extent upon the stability of the economy e.g. fiscal balance, and reasonably predictable levels of inflation.<br>Macroeconomic stability reduces the risks of investment and might therefore be seen as a necessary condition for growth. Fiscal balance ensures that there is less risk of inflation, because there will be less risk of governments printing money. This may also stabilise the exchange rate and allow interest rates to be set at a reasonably low level. Countries with macro economic stability are likely to achieve higher growth rate than the countries with macro economic imbalance. Stability is also an important factor in the amount of foreign direct investment a country may be able to attract. Differences in FDI that countries are able to attract also result in differences in growth rates.</p>
<p>Some countries have achieved high growth rate by abolishing restrictions (tariffs and quotas) on trade. Governments in the same countries also targeted research and development and the education and skills of their workers, thus achieving higher growth rate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, sources of high growth rates in some countries not only depend on the will of the governments and people but also on the level of effectiveness of the measures adopted by their governments.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 127</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9003</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The Chairman of a national bank stated 'It is important to rely on a range of qualitative and quantitative data to assess the economic health of the nation.'</p>

Economists have developed various measures based on a variety of data for this purpose. The most important indicator is the general quality of life of people in a country. The World Bank defines quality of life as:</p>
<p>"a better quality of life generally calls for higher incomes --- but it involves much more. It encompasses as ends in themselves better education, higher standard of health and nutrition, less poverty, a cleaner environment, more equality of opportunity, greater individual freedom, and a richer cultural life."</p>
<p>Real GNP per capita is the traditional benchmark in assessing quality of life. Levels and rates of growth of "real" per capita GNP (monetary growth of GNP per capita minus the rate of inflation) are normally used to measure the overall economic well-being of a population i.e. how much of goods and services is available to the average citizen for consumption and investment.</p>
<p>But it has obvious limitations as a guide to the welfare of the population.</p>
<p>GNP per capita figures hide significant regional variations in output and employment. Within each region there are also areas of relative prosperity contrasting with unemployment and deep-rooted social and economic deprivation. The figures on their own do not show the distribution of income and the uneven spread of financial wealth. Incomes and earnings may be very unequally distributed among the population and rising national prosperity can still be accompanied by rising relative poverty.</p>
<p>Rising national output might have been accompanied by an increase in pollution and other negative externalities which have a negative effect on economic welfare. The data on GNP does not indicate the existence of these negative effects. As a quantitative measure output figures miss out on the quality of goods and services produced. Also, rising national output might have been achieved at the expense of leisure time if workers are working longer hours, again not indicated by GNP figures. We also need to analyse the balance between consumption and investment. If an economy devotes too many resources to satisfy the short run needs ＆ wants of consumers, there may be insufficient resources for investment needed for long term economic well being. Higher GNP might improve living standards today but lead to an over-exploitation of finite economic resources thereby limiting future prospects.</p>
<p>GNP per head figures might understate the true living standards because of the existence and growth of the black economy. The black economy includes economic activity that goes unrecorded. The non-monetised sectors of the economy include output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed products. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies.</p>
<p>GNP is not a complete measure of economic welfare; nor is it meant to be. It is a measure of output or income, and should be seen in that context. <br>So economists have developed several alternatives that take other factors into account and give a more complete picture of the level of human well-being.</p>
<p>One of those is measure of economic welfare (MEW). This starts with GNP and NNP. To this was added an allowance for leisure, for various non-marketed goods and services such as housework and underground activities, for the services of various public amenities such as parks and roads, and for private durable goods such as furniture and jewellery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various items were subtracted. These included regrettables' such as expenditure on defence and commuting to work, and various 'bads' such as pollution. Also various intermediate items such as the benefits of education were subtracted.</p>
<p>The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies around the world.</p>
<p>The most well-known measure of quality of life is the Human Development Index (HDI) that has been developed under the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
<p>The Human Development Index (HDI) is the average of three indicators:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight)</p>
<p>The closer the HDI is to 1, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators.</p>
<p>The advantage of using HDI is that it highlights the fact that people's welfare is influenced not only by the goods and services available to them but also by their ability to lead a long and healthy life and to acquire knowledge, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative factors.</p>
<p>As mentioned above income is an integral part of determining quality of life but not the only factor, we also need to consider the data on some important economic variables which determine the over all outlook of an economy.</p>
<p>A healthy economy is also characterized by general macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic stability reduces the risks of investment and might therefore be seen as a necessary condition for growth. So, economic growth will depend to some extent upon the stability of the economy e.g. fiscal balance, and reasonably predictable levels of inflation. Fiscal balance ensures that there is less risk of inflation. This may also stabilise the exchange rate and allow interest rates to be set at a reasonably low level. Sustained growth rate ensures unemployment to be kept under control. Stability is also an important factor in the amount of foreign direct investment a country may be able to attract. On the other hand macroeconomic instability may lead to volatile fluctuations in the level of economic activities and undermine the process of uplifting economic welfare, therefore, considered unhealthy. For example, high growth rate with even higher rate of inflation and growing trade balance is a sign of instability or considered unhealthy. Alternatively no or low growth rate might lead to growing unemployment and poverty, hence results in higher crime rate and unrest among masses.</p>
<p>Apart from macroeconomic stability health of an economy can also be judged by the data on efficient working of markets. Efficient markets improve welfare of individual consumers. In markets where high degree of competition exists right products are produced and they are produced in right quantities. Thus consumers, not only be perfectly informed, but also be sovereign. Inefficient allocation might result in growing negative externalities such as pollution and existence of monopolies and oligopolies. High negative externalities is the result of allocating more resources than the socially optimum level. Monopolies and oligopolies undermine consumer sovereignty and result in under allocation of resources. Similarly, wide and persistent income differentials indicate inefficient labour markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The existence of an efficient financial sector is important for the efficient working of commodity markets as they provide necessary finances to individual businesses to make use of investment opportunities as they arise.</p>
<p>Overall health of an economy can be judged by taking several factors into account. An assessment can be developed based on a combination of both quantitative and qualitative factors for this purpose.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 128</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9001</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The World Bank has given a loan to support the Ugandan government's road development programme.

<p>Usually these types of programmes are designed to consolidate the basis with which the economic activities of private sector can be integrated in future.</p>
<p>An increase in government expenditure on large road building programme will create a full multiplied rise in employment and national income. The reason is that all the money gets spent and thus all of it goes to boosting aggregate demand.</p>
<p>According to economic theory , any change in autonomous expenditure results in a proportionately larger change in national income. This is known as the multiplier effect. In an open economy with government the size of multiplier is determined by the reciprocal of marginal propensity to leakages.</p>
<p>Algebrically: &nbsp;K=1/MPL<br>Where MPL = MPS+ MPT + MPM <br>Alternatively: &nbsp;K = △Y/△J</p>
<p>Where MPS, MPT and MPM represent marginal propensity to save, marginal propensity to tax and marginal propensity to imports. The sum of these is MPL. It is the proportion of an increase in NY that is withdrawn from the circular flow. The higher the amount of withdrawals the lower is the multiplier effect.</p>
<p>To get an idea how a larger increase in income results from a given increase in government expenditure. We can follow the progress of the increased injection around the circular flow of money. If say, government spends $10 billion on constructing new road networks it needs to employ thousands of engineers, technicians and workers and also needs to buy machinery and raw material.</p>
<p>In doing so, other firms will need to increase their out put of investment goods and, to do so, will take on more labour. The new employees will now have wages, profits will have increased, and total income will have risen by the $10 billion. If we assume MPC of fourfifths and MPL of one-fifth, we know households will spend $8 billion and the remaining $1 billion will be withdrawn as savings, imports and taxes. The addition to consumption further increases aggregate demand. This time, the firms producing consumer goods find sales rising and stocks falling. They will increase output, take on more labour, pay more in wages and earn more profits. If we continue to calculate increase in expenditure occurring as a result of this expansion in the economy we will be able to calculate final change in NY. The effect is shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/04fa14673da2f4c86fd8cd6a6d413ece" alt="" width="332" height="223"></p>
<p>Once, roads construction completes trns mumpner effect will not stop here. New road facilities will enable producers to reach markets which were out of their reach. Hence, to increase output they hire more workers and pay more incomes which will have a multiple increase in NY. Raw material can be transported speedily from far off areas to factories locating at considerable distance. Thus incomes of the people of newly connected areas will rise which when they spent result in multiple rise in incomes and employment.</p>
<p>A well established and organised road and transport sector is essential for efficient working of markets. As, with the availability of roads, speedy and timely transportation is made possible, therefore, shortages and surpluses in commodities and labour markets are quickly removed.</p>
<p>In countries where regional disparity exists, construction of roads helps reduce income differentials among different areas and leads to a reduction in income disparity.</p>
<p>The extra spending by the government on road construction is usually financed from borrowing, expecting that it will boost economic activity in future and hence, will result in higher tax revenue, that government can use to repay its debts. But if the government is unable to receive its targeted revenue in future, excessive borrowing can prove to be an extra fiscal burden and can be highly inflationary.</p>
<p>Thus road construction is important in many ways for the development of a country but it needs to be planned carefully so as to extend its benefits to majority.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 129</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：9000</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether demand schedules and budget line diagrams are similar in the way they represent the effect of</p>

<br>We can now plot the demand schedule on a graph to see how quantity demanded of chocolates relates to variation in price. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/45e87959bff13287d6a98bfa41d6b471" alt="" width="354" height="232"><br>The negative slope of the demand curve indicates the inverse relationship between QD and P i.e. QD rises as price falls and vice versa. <br>A budget line, on the other hand, reveals all combinations of two products that are obtainable, given the individual's income and the prices of the two products. For example, an individual may have $100 to spend on two products per week. Assuming the individual spends all of $100 with the price of product X $20 and that of product Y $10. Thus the equation for the budget line is: $100 = $20X + $10Y. This can be produced diagrammatically as in the figure below. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/25b45bf39514013c01c799331af64eba" alt="" width="322" height="206"><br>The individual can be at point a purchasing 10 units of Y but unable to buy any of product X, or the point f purchasing 5 units of X but none of product Y. Alternatively the consumer could be at any point between a and f on the budget line. Points above the budget line are unobtainable and the slope of the budget line depends on the relative prices of the two products. <br><br>From the above descriptions of demand schedule and budget line we can make out that both portray two different aspects of consumption of a good, therefore several differences can be identified in their effect of a rise in price of a good. <br><br>Firstly, the demand schedule reflects consumers' willingness and ability to buy only one product at different prices, therefore, the demand curve for a particular product is drawn against various prices measured on y-axis and the quantity demanded on x-axis. In contrast to this, a budget line is drawn to show the various quantities of the two products which the consumer can obtain from the given money income and prices of the products. Therefore, a budget line, unlike demand curve, does not indicate the quantities that the consumer would buy rather it simply reflects the ability of the consumer to buy both the products; thus we measure the quantities of two products on each of the two axis. Secondly, the effect of a rise in price of a good, ceteris paribus, is shown by an upward movement along the demand curve while the effect of rise in price of one of the two products with the money income remaining constant, causes a pivotal inward shift in the budget line that signifies that the consumer can obtain a smaller quantity of the good at the new price. This is illustrated in the graphs below:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ec146ef56ca93b3ec253d166b002bf36" alt="" width="449" height="236"><br>Figure (i) illustrates the effect of a rise in price of a product in terms of upward movement along the demand curve. Thus it clearly shows Q<sub>1</sub> the new quantity bought at a higher price P<sub>1</sub>. On the contrary, the effect of the rise in price of the same product is shown by a pivotal leftward shift in the budget line on x-axis. Thus it shows that less of X can be purchased at the new price but, unlike demand curve, does not point out the actual quantity bought.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The effect of a rise in consumer's income is likely to shift both the demand curve and the budget line parallel. However the direction of shift in the demand curve is subject to the consumers' view of the product. In case of a normal good, for instance, the demand curve is likely to shift parallel outward because a rise in income induces consumer to buy more of a normal good at each and every price. However, if the product is generally considered inferior then the demand curve will shift leftward that is opposite to the shift in the budget line. This is because inferior goods are associated with a negative income effect. These effects are shown in the graphs below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/48173038b51c1137bb85199e235677a8" alt="" width="440" height="225"><br><br>In graph 1 a rise in income can bring shift in the demand curve in either direction. If, for instance, the good in question is viewed as normal then the demand curve will shift to D<sub>1</sub>. However, in case the good in question is considered inferior then the demand curve will shift to D<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand the budget line will always shift outward because it simply reflects the quantities that the consumer can purchase with the given prices of the two goods at the new income level.<br><br>The two curves, however, are similar in a way that both on their own cannot point out the new quantity that the consumer will buy at the new income level. In case of demand curve we need to know the supply curve in order to exactly indicate the quantity consumer will buy after a rise in income. Similarly we cannot use the budget line alone to indicate the quantity that the consumer will buy at the new income level unless we incorporate the preference curve to our analysis.</li>

For example, construction of a 500 km motor way connecting two major cities requires extensive analysis of the rout in terms of acquiring land, an analysis of land composition, commercial viability of connecting different towns and&nbsp;cities and above all, the permission from concerning authorities. All this consume considerable amount of finances, time and efforts before the actual launch of the project can be made. Private sector is not often willing to spend so much just to find out whether a project is commercially viable. Even when project is estimated as a commercial success, the time that it may take to complete and even longer to recover all the investment made, makes it less attractive for private sector. The longer the time it takes to recover investment and earn some return from the project the riskier the investment. Therefore, private sector usually does not engage themselves in these kinds of projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projects such as roads and communication are known as social and economic infrastructure. They facilitate and integrate economic activities. For example, investment by a farmer in a new tractor may increase the total output of vegetables he can produce, but without adequate transport facilities to get this extra product to commercial markets, his investment may not add anything to national food production.</p>
<p>Governments usually have the capacity to plan such projects which would not have high short term gains but are important for uplifting economic prosperity in future. The finances, technical and support staff required can be arranged by the government. Uncertainties can be reduced by the effective control on planning process.</p>
<p>Moreover, governments usually carry out an even more extensive cost-benefit analysis. It includes external cost and benefits to assess the viability of a project on the basis of social efficiency. Usually such projects have more external benefits. Therefore, their MSC &lt; MC and if left on market forces they are bound to be under produced. External benefits may include development of new industrial estates due to the availability of better and faster means of transportation. It may reduce congestion or demand pressure on other transport providers such as railways etc. Such projects are usually integrated into government's regional policy to uplift economically deprived areas and distribute income fairly.</p>
<p>In conclusion, government may consider road building as essential part of development of infrastructure in the economy for achieving wide spread economic prosperity in future. Since private sector conducts limited CBA including only private gains and private cost, therefore, such projects may be considered risky and unprofitable, but from the society's point of view, they are considered desirable for generating net social welfare.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 131</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8998</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In 2005 London Energy stated that as a company it invested millions of pounds in improving efficiency to reduce costs.

Nevertheless it is still constrained by its demand curve. A rise in price will lower the quantity demanded. In order for a firm to maintain its monopoly position there must be barriers to the entry of new firms. Barriers can be of various forms, such as economies of scale, high capital cost, high sunk cost, legal and various marketing barriers.</p>
<p>As with firms in other market structure, a monopolist will maximize profit where MR = MC. In figure below profit is maximized at the price pm and output OQm.</p>
<p>As the degree of competition in an industry improves a monopoly changes into oligopoly or in monopolistic competition the demand curve for individual firms becomes flatter (elastic). Firm's power to set price for its product is weakened. In perfectly competitive market the demand curve of an individual firm becomes perfectly elastic and all firms become price takers.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a513b30a1094f9fe16974fd3a414cf97" alt="" width="369" height="262"><br><br>If there are constant long-run marginal costs the sole seller will face the entire downward-sloping demand curve. The monopolist therefore produces at Q<sub>m</sub> and charges a price P<sub>m</sub> (MC = MR). Now we assume that the&nbsp;degree of competition improves and market becomes perfectly competitive also the costs stay the same then the equilibrium price will be P<sub>c</sub> and the equilibrium quantity supplied and demanded will be Q<sub>c</sub>. But in imperfectly competitive market price set will be below Pm and above P<sub>c</sub> as the demand curve of an individual firm becomes flatter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see, then, that a monopolist charges a higher price and produces less than an industry in a competitive situation. Resources are misallocated in such a situation - too few resources are being used in the monopolist's industry and too many are used elsewhere. As we have pointed out before, this difference between monopoly and competition arises not because of differences in costs but rather because of differences in the demand curves facing the individual firms.</p>
<p>We can extend our analysis further to point out difference in consumer surplus and dead weight loss. In figure above the area of consumer surplus is YTP<sub>c</sub> in the case of the perfectly competitive industry. Whereas consumer surplus in a monopoly situation is P<sub>m</sub>SVP<sub>c</sub>. The area under the demand curve shrinks to YSP<sub>m</sub>. The monopolist gains the area p<sub>c</sub>VSp<sub>m</sub> at the expense of consumers; this area is defined as producer surplus. The triangular area STY is part of consumer surplus in a competitive market. But in monopoly neither consumers nor the monopolist obtain this as a surplus: it is lost to both parties. Because of this it is called the deadweight welfare loss arising from monopolies.</p>
<p>In our analysis the assumption was that increase in competition does not change the cost structure. Of course, if monopolization results in higher marginal cost, then the cost to society is even greater. However, if monopoly results in cost savings, then the cost to society is less.</p>
<p>With increase in competition there are at least two additional costs saved in terms of resource misallocation that may occur when monopolies exist. One involves the resources used by individuals in order to obtain and maintain monopoly. Society also ends up expending resources in preventing monopolies or trying to break them up.</p>
<p>The other cost involves possible inefficiencies within the monopoly firm. In principle, a monopolist cannot be completely minimizing the costs of production and that monopolist will not necessarily go out of business in the long run. The notion that costs are not minimized by effective management is called X-inefficiency.</p>
<p>On the contrary, monopolist may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale due to larger plant, centralised administration and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication (e.g. a monopoly gas company would eliminate the need for several sets of rival gas pipes under each street). If this results then MC curve can be substantially below that of the same industry under competitive market i.e. the monopoly will produce a higher output at a lower price. In figure below the&nbsp;monopoly produces Q<sub>1.</sub>Comparing this with price p<sub>2</sub> and output Q<sub>2</sub> when market is perfectly competitive competitive (QD = QS). Price will be even higher than this and output lower than this in imperfectly competitive market (MC = MR).<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a2c1967e6bb1177eb515d9565e79e10a" alt="" width="416" height="285"><br><br>This results only if the monopolist's MC curve is below point x. Even if monopolist were to follow P = MC rule. It would still charge a lower price p<sub>3</sub> and produce higher output Q<sub>3</sub>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A monopolist can use part of its supernormal profits for research and development and investment. It thus has a greater ability to become efficient than has the small firm with limited funds. Also a perfectly contestable monopoly is as efficient as any firm in a competitive environment and earns only normal profits.<br>Finally, society benefits from increasing competition if it leads to cost saving but when competition results in increasing costs then monopoly is preferred.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 132</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8997</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The use of cars causes market failure.

When economists use the term efficiency they actually mean allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>An economy is said to achieve allocative efficiency when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. In other words allocative efficiency occurs when the consumer valuation equals the cost of the resources (marginal cost) used up in production of a product. Thus the condition required for allocative efficiency is price = marginal cost. When this happens economic welfare measured in terms of consumer and producer surplus is maximized. The graph below illustrates allocative efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/5d6898450182020e7a52f4faaf79b5d3" alt="" width="283" height="200"></p>
<p>The optimum allocation of resources is where QD = QS, producing an output oq at price op. So the equilibrium in the market implies P = MC, hence generating maximum possible amounts of consumer and producer surplus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2b661015a6b50c47d505e5ee026b7ac3" alt="" width="319" height="208"></p>
<p>At the level of output of 100,000 cars, P &gt;MC. It indicates that fewer resources have been allocated than what are required to achieve perfect allocation i.e. P = MC. Thus each additional car up to 200,000 would increase both consumer and producer surplus indicated by triangle A, hence would improve allocative efficiency. On the other hand P &lt; MC signifies that too many resources have been allocated for the production of cars. In the graph above the production of 300,000 cars would represent an over allocation of resources. Hence the shaded triangle B represents welfare loss in terms of consumer and producer surplus from the alternative product. Therefore net gains can be realized until production can be reduced to 200,000 cars.</p>
<p>Hence resources are being efficiently allocated to any product when its output is such that its price equals marginal cost.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. Productive efficiency exists when producers minimize the wastage of resources i.e. when they produce a product using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/00d1b830edabeca845689a99feb5921f" alt="" width="304" height="200"></p>
<p>In the figure above AC<sub>3</sub> indicates productive efficiency. This means that the lowest possible cost techniques of&nbsp;production are being used to produce different level of&nbsp;output. All curves above AC<sub>3</sub> indicate higher per unit cost hence represent productive inefficiency. The firm is said to be producing at the optimum level when production occurs at the lowest point indicated by point z on the lowest average cost curve. Economists use the term technical efficiency for this point.</p>
<p>Market forces do all the good things that we have discussed; yet there are many situations in which these forces do not produce the best outcomes. In these cases we say that markets have failed.</p>
<p>Market failure exists when the competitive outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. The result is a loss of economic and social welfare. This is usually because the benefits that the free-market confers on individuals or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits to the society as a whole.</p>
<p>The first of these situations occurs when firms facing downward sloping demand curves - whether a monopoly or firms in an imperfect market - will maximize profits at an output where price exceeds marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. This is shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c42a61c291b4941f58580ac051b63651" alt="" width="331" height="186"></p>
<p>Under perfect competition the price is determined by market demand and supply forces, hence Pp is the market price and the industry will sell Qp output. The industry is said to achieve allocative efficiency because P = MC. On the other hand a monopolist, for instance, will produce where MC = MR. Thus it produces QM output and will sell this at Pm price. Clearly the monopolist produces where MC&lt; P, hence monopoly results in a loss of consumer and producer surplus shown by the triangular area 3 + 5. Also lack of competition reduces welfare of consumers because they have a little choice available. So, overall society will be worse off.</p>
<p>Besides imperfect markets, the existence of externalities also causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer benefits on others that are not involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem created by externalities is that market forces will lead to either too little or too much production. With a positive externality, a competitive free market will produce too little of the good and with a negative externality it produces too much of the good. Thus the presence of externalities, even when all markets are perfectly competitive, leads to allocatively inefficient outcomes.</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto the other party. The other party loses because they do not have the same information. More generally, whenever either party to a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency. <br>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how good or bad a particular product is for them: either they do not have the right information or they simply lack some relevant information. The problem is that their existence will cause market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of the product being produced or consumed.</p>
<p>A distinct type of market failure exists in case of public goods. The issue here is not over and under allocation but whether resources are allocated at all. A good must possess three distinguishing characteristics to qualify as public goods. It must be non-excludable, non-rival and non-rejectable. These features give rise to the free rider problem; people receiving benefits from a good without contributing to its cost. Thus it develops a situation in which everyone believes that others will take on the burden of paying for goods such as national defense and streetlights. People may wish for the provision of such goods, but the demand may never be registered in the market. Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive to supply them. Because these goods cannot be priced and sold, it would be unprofitable for a private enterprise to allocate resources to them. So we have these goods which yield substantial benefits but to which the market would fail to allocate resources.</p>
<p>The role of the government is to intervene in markets that are not seen to be allocating resources in the most efficient manner. Government policy and methods of intervention can be summarized under four broad headings: regulation, financial intervention, direct provision and improving information. The method chosen will depend to a large extent on its effectiveness under the given circumstances.</p>
<p>As explained above, production of cars results in market failure when prices of cars are lower than the opportunity cost of resources used in their production (MC). While the use of private cars can be treated as market failure in that they possibly generate both positive and negative externalities. Positive externalities include less crowded public transport with greater comfort for the users. In addition government generates revenue from taxing the car users which could be used to good effect for the whole society. Negative externalities include pollution from the smoke emission. Also too many cars on roads can cause road congestion and increase the possibility of accidents. In both cases market failures exist because too little or too many resources are allocated through market forces.</p>
<p>Governments are more&nbsp;likely to use financial intervention and regulations in case of over allocation of resources in production and externalities arising from the use of cars. Financial intervention means the use of indirect tax and subsidy to achieve optimum allocation of resources while the use of regulations entails laws regulating the production and consumption of a good. In general the results of cost benefit analysis in many countries suggests that negative externalities arising from the use of cars heavily outweighs positive externalities therefore they are a case of over allocation. Thus, unlike other positive externalities where subsidies have been used, it has never been suggested that subsidies ought to be used to increase the positive externalities from private car use. Rather any subsidies given are used to make alternative public transport more attractive.</p>
<p>Therefore economic theory suggests that governments need to tax firstly to reduce the production of cars to achieve allocative efficiency; although taxing production might not result in productive efficiency, and secondly to decrease negative externalities in their use. In many economies indirect taxes such as VAT and excise duties are used to raise the prices of cars in order to achieve efficient allocation of resources and higher road tax coupled with stricter regulations are being increasingly introduced in order to achieve socially optimal usage level of cars. These measures are particularly designed to increase the opportunity cost of consumption and thereby reduce consumer demand towards a socially optimal level.</p>
<p>In conclusion it can be said that the economic theory supports the view that production and use of cars can result in market forces to fail in achieving efficient allocation of scarce resources and therefore governments have a role in affecting their production and use to socially optimum level.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 133</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8996</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>Emerging economics and the way out of a recession</strong></p>
<p>During the recession of 2009 several economists forecast that some emerging (fast developing) economies would perform better than the developed economies. One indicator of this, they said, was the strength of the exchange rate of the currency of some emerging economies against the US dollar. For example, between November 2008 and July 2009, the Brazilian currency rose 11.4% against the dollar and the Indonesian currency rose 10.2%. Another indicator was the forecast growth rate in GDP as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b22d62af02ae6a946c26b9b2a1a670e4" alt="" width="472" height="377"></p>
<p>Emerging economies are often dependent on exports to achieve an increase in GDP. Some economists suggested that it would be better for their economic growth if these countries were to concentrate on domestic demand rather than exports.</p>
<p>China, in particular, they said could lead the world out of the recession if it relied increasingly on domestic demand. Indeed, the Chinese government encouraged a shift from export-led industries to programmes aimed at improving the Chinese infrastructure in order to create jobs and thus increase consumption of Chinese goods. Banks were encouraged to make borrowing easier in order to create more credit for consumers and businesses. The government started a massive fiscal stimulus and increased its forecast of GDP to a growth rate of 8.3% in 2009 and 10.9% for 2010 (previous forecast figures were 6.0% and 7.0% as in Table 1)</p>
<p>However, other economists do not accept that there should be an emphasis on domestic demand. They argue that trading links are the strongest evidence of the emerging economies' ability to grow. They state 'no emerging market that adopted an export-led growth model has subsequently needed to break away from it - including China'. China's exports as a percentage of GDP are 32% compared with only 13% for the US. Smaller Asian countries are even more dependent on exports; Singapore's ratio of exports to GDP is 234%, Hong Kong's is 169%. It will be difficult for economies such as these to increase domestic demand and reduce their dependence on export-led growth.</p>

<li>Identify the two policy approaches suggested by economists in the article and discuss whether there is a conflict between them.</li>

<li>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in one year time period. The term 'gross' indicates that depreciation of capital is still to be accounted for and the term 'domestic output' includes goods and services produced by citizen-supplied and foreign-supplied resources within a particular nation's geographical boundaries.<br><br></li>
<li>The phrase 'to make borrowing easy' suggests that the Chinese government urges its commercial banks to extend credit at lower interest rate with relatively lenient and flexible conditions. Easy credit policy is likely to bring an upsurge in the domestic demand and therefore would increase national income by a larger proportion through the multiplier effect. Overall the Chinese government seems to redirect its growth policy by incorporating the growing domestic demand.<br><br></li>
<li>A significant appreciation in exchange rate of many emerging economies, against the US$ within a span of nine months supports the view. This is because it suggests that their exports might have risen and therefore signifies improvement in these economies. However, this particular view is based on the data of only two of many emerging economies. Moreover there are no comparative figures given on the exchange rate of other developed countries. It can also be argued that this rising exchange rate could erode economic improvement if any, by making it difficult for emerging economies to sell their exports. <br><br>Besides exchange rate, the forecast figures of growth rate in GDP of select few emerging and developed economies reflect improvement in both types of economies. The developed economies are showing a turnaround in their GDP growth from negative to positive. In case of emerging economies only Hong Kong is expected to register negative growth but that too is lower than 2008. Others such as India and China are likely to increase an already positive growth rate while the rest, unlike 2008, are expected to register a positive growth in their GDP in 2009. <br><br>However, these figures are only of selected countries and for only two years. Also the fact that these figures are not actual rather they are based on projections undermines the view that there has been an improvement in economic situation. <br><br>Thus we conclude that the evidence provided in the article is insufficient to establish the view that the economic situation has improved in the emerging economies.<br><br></li>
<li>The two policy approaches refer to the two distinct growth models namely consumption-led growth and export-led growth. They can be viewed as different approaches with a common goal of economic growth. Growth is defined as the percentage annual increase in national output. The major determinants of growth in the short run are variations in the growth of aggregate demand. <br><br>AD is the total spending on goods and services made within the country. This spending consists of four elements: consumer spending (C), investment expenditure (I), government spending (G), and the expenditure by foreign residents on the country's goods and services (X). From these four must be subtracted any expenditure that goes on imports (M). Hence AD = C + I + G + X - M and a rise in AD will create shortages. This will tend to stimulate the firms to increase output, thus reducing slack in the economy. <br><br>Export-led growth is the result of a faster growth in exports than other components of national expenditure while consumption-led growth is the result of a proportionately larger increase in domestic consumption than other components of national expenditure. In both cases the result is increase in injections leading to an increase in national expenditure (AD) and hence national income by multiplier effect, therefore there is no conflict. <br><br>However, a potential conflict can be identified between the two in terms of their consequences. Firstly, export oriented growth is likely increase inflow of money leading to an improvement in balance of payment. On the contrary consumption-led growth is likely to increase incomes in general and therefore results in higher level of imports causing an outflow of money. Since a greater outflow of money deteriorates BOP, therefore, it needs to be offset by further export growth. Secondly export-led growth policy can be expansionary without necessarily inducing inflationary pressures. On the other hand, domestic-demand-led policy can result in expansion but with inflation, and the resulting lower real wages of the previously employed workers may induce further wage-price inflation as workers may try to recover their previous real wage rates. <br><br>Thus it can be concluded that both approaches target economic growth as their goal but the conflict between the two exists in their means and possible consequences.</li>

In the short run total cost is divided into total fixed costs and total variable costs. But in the long run no such distinction is made owing to varying nature of all different costs. The analysis of cost structure becomes more meaningful with their averages. The average cost concept is simply one in which we are measuring cost per unit of output. In real world this concept of averages is an important means for business decision making. Average cost is measured as follows:</p>
<p>AC = (Total Costs)/(output)</p>
<p>TC increases as a firm expands the size of its output. But the rate at which TC increases, known as MC, varies, which makes AC of the firm to fall and then to rise both in the short run and long run.</p>
<p>When it comes to making long run production decisions the firm has much more flexibility. It does not have to operate with plant and equipment of a fixed size. It can expand the whole scale of operations by making new investment. Since there are no fixed factors in the long run, there are no long run fixed costs. For example, the firm may invest in more land or install new machines. Its interest bill along with the cost of other inputs goes up as it expands its output. All costs, then, in the long run are variable costs.</p>
<p>According to economists investment means physical investment both in purchase of fixed capital in the form of machinery and buildings, and also in the form of purchase of raw materials which are working or circulating capital. Investment in working capital is a short run decision therefore, will change per unit cost in the short run. SRAC may rise or fall depends on the degree of utilization of existing capacity and therefore, is subject to diminishing return.</p>
<p>When new and expensive investment is physical capital it implies that it is a long run decision. Therefore, it must result in expansion of production unit and hence output. We can explain the effects of changes in cost structure due to this new investment on a firm's long run average cost curve.</p>
<p>A long run average cost curve (LRAC) shows how average cost varies with output on the assumption that the least cost method of production will be chosen for each output. If the firm experiences economies of scale its LRAC curve will fall as new investment expands the scale of production. If diseconomies of scale predominate, the LRAC curve will rise. Alternatively, if the firm experiences neither economies nor diseconomies of scale, the LRAC curve will be horizontal as shown in the figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8922588ade59f13dea124ce91f4b3580" alt="" width="382" height="199"><br><br>When new investment results in an increase in the scale of production, it lowers cost per unit of output.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why firms experience economies of scale. The firm can introduce more division of labour and specialization as it increases its size. If firms make new investment to link certain processes it reduces costs per unit of output. When new investment is in research and development the firm may achieve product innovation or process innovation. Product innovation is often associated with many small-scale and subtle changes to the characteristics and performance of a particular product. Process innovations involve changes to the way in which production takes place, be it on the factory floor, in backroom administration, business logistics or innovative behaviour in managing employees in the workplace. The effects can be both on a firm's cost structure as well as on the balance of factor inputs used in production (i.e. labour and capital). <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b3eace3f26f8fe6d96d5db94e7863c8a" alt="" width="306" height="225"><br><br>Cost reducing innovations have the effect of causing an outward shift in market supply and they also provide the scope for businesses to enjoy higher profit margins with a given level of demand. Process innovation should lead to a more efficient use of scarce resources reflected in gains in productive efficiency.<br>The diagram above uses standard costs and revenue curves to show the effect of driving down production costs from SRAC1 to LRAC - leading to lower prices and a higher level of output.</p>
<p>When new investment results in expansion in the existing plant or installation of new plants, substantial plant level economies of scale are possible, for example, a variety of technical and managerial economies. These economies are available up to a certain size of plant, followed by a flattening of the LRAC curve as the scope for further scale economies becomes exhausted. With &nbsp;increasing size the firm also gains various firm-level cost saving benefits, for example, large firms may be able to use their market power both to buy supplies at lower prices and also to market their products on better terms. They can often borrow from banks and other financial institutions at a lower rate of interest and on better terms. Also larger firms can spread their risks by diversifying their output, their markets, their sources of supply and finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the effects of new and expensive investment can be analysed on both firm's SRAC and LRAC. It leads to an increase in firm's total cost, but the firm is more interested to know the effects on per unit cost (AC) for further decision making.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 135</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8994</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'Developing countries have a low standard of living, yet many have much wealth in natural resources which multinational companies would like to exploit.'</p>

The base-line measure of the standard of living is real GDP or real GDP per capita. This is the value of total output divided by the population. Other things being equal, a sustained increase in real GDP increases a nation's standard of living providing that output rises faster than the total population.</p>
<p>However it must be remembered that real GDP and hence real GDP per capita on its own is both an inaccurate and insufficient indicator of true living standards. Thus, economic statistics may not bear much relation to how well off we are for the following reasons.</p>
<p>Official data on a nation's GDP tends to understate the true growth of real national income per capita over time due to the expansion of the shadow (or underground) economy and also the value of unpaid work done by millions of volunteers and people caring for their family members. On the other hand GDP per head overstates living standard when an increase in real GDP might have been achieved at the expense of leisure time if workers are working longer hours which can cause stress and damage family life - two social indicators that potentially create some negative externalities for society as a whole. Also rising output might have been accompanied by an increase in air and noise pollution and other negative effect on our social welfare. Much spending in an economy is on defense, or to recover the damage from externalities e.g. cleaning up the effects of pollution, managing the huge and growing volume of waste; driving long distances to and from work. This spending adds directly to our GDP but does not really add to our material welfare. Moreover improvements in life expectancy have a huge impact on people's living standards but don't always show through in the GDP accounts. Surely it must be factored into any overall assessment of living standards and the quality of life.</p>
<p>A more widely used and accepted indicator of living standard is the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is the average of three indices based on three different variables:</p>
<p><strong>•&nbsp; </strong>Life expectancy at birth <br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Education - a weighted average of adult literacy (twothirds) and average years of schooling (one third)<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Real GNP per capita - measured in US dollars, at purchasing power parity exchange rates.</p>
<p>Clearly, this index gives us a better way of estimating standards of living than just GDP taken on its own. However, it is still far from perfect because it does not include factors such as income distribution, ownership of durables, gender inequalities, and inequalities by region or by ethnic group.</p>
<p>Improvement in living standard requires expansion of a country's national output. For most developing countries, especially the countries with low levels of living, growth was jump-started by the induction of multinational organization (MNCs). A multinational corporation (MNC) is a business organisation which has its headquarters in one country but has operations in a range of different countries. There are numerous examples of such organisations, car manufacturers like Ford, Toyota and technology companies like Dell, Microsoft etc.</p>
<p>The essence of MNCs is that they bring inward investment to develop and exploit natural resources of developing countries. It can be argued that MNCs bring with them new ideas and new techniques that can help to improve the quality of production and help boost the quality of human capital in the host country. In some cases, production in a host country may be primarily aimed at the export market. However, in other cases, the inward investment might have been made to gain access to the host country market to circumvent trade barriers. As a result, MNCs pay large sums in taxes to the host government which can be used to finance projects of economic welfare. In addition to the investment in a country in production, a company might also invest in additional infrastructure facilities like road, rail, port and communications facilities. This can uplift the material welfare of the whole country. Thus investment by MNCs is likely to provide a boost to the host economy. Though the effects of the investment might be less dramatic but nevertheless, it can be something that is seen as essential for helping a country escape from poverty.</p>
<p>However, these firms, by their very nature, are large organisations. Their size means they often have considerable power and influence and as a result have come in for some criticism of their actions. It is argued that many jobs might go to skilled workers from other countries rather than to domestic workers. Also how many new jobs are created depends on the type of investment. Investment into capital-intensive production facilities might not bring as many jobs to an area as hoped. Moreover developing countries usually have less rigorous regulatory authorities that monitor the environmental impact of MNC activities. This can cause long-term problems. Furthermore, MNCs' profits usually go back to the headquarters of the MNC rather than staying in the host country. The benefits, therefore, might not be as great.</p>
<p>Finally, the size and power of multinationals can be used, it is argued, to exploit weak or corrupt governments to get better deals for the MNC. For instance, they are often blamed for excessive extraction of natural resources with little regard to the environment of the host country. This means mining all the ores and minerals that the land offered. Cutting down the rainforest for timber or burning it to free land for agriculture. Cutting hills and mountains for transport and communication. Of course the export of these natural resources brings revenue for developing countries to finance development. But the depletion of natural resources and negative impact on environment undermine sustainable growth and future living standard. The graph below helps to understand this situation.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a61ddc2729e6647064eb4eac06bf49c4" alt="" width="392" height="218"></p>
<p>In the case of natural resources a profit maximizing MNC would extract Oq<sub>2</sub> amount where MPB = MPC.</p>
<p>However social optimum level of output is Oq<sub>1</sub>. Hence private optimum level exceeds social optimum level of extraction, therefore results in a net cost on society and thus reduces the welfare by the shaded triangle.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to achieving high and sustainable economic growth and hence improvement in quality of life in general is to invest in human capital. Investment in human capital is any expenditure undertaken to improve the education, skills and health which increase productivity. For developing countries, to remove economic backwardness and instill the capacities and motivations to progress, it is necessary to improve the knowledge, skills and health of the people. In fact, without an improvement in the quality of human factor the nation cannot make the efficient use of natural resources and physical capital. Thus government expenditure on programmes which increase basic literacy, education and health help enhance economic growth and hence living standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all their drawbacks MNCs are still thought to provide a relatively quick solution to the problem of low level of living in developing countries. However, government spending on education and health is a far better approach to achieving sustainable growth and hence improvement in quality of life.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 136</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8992</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what is meant by liquidity preference and discuss how it might be affected by an increase in unemployment.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The demand for money refers to the amount of wealth everyone in the economy wishes to hold in the form of money balances. In the Keynesian analysis of the rate of interest, demand for money is not based purely on the demand for new capital goods. In fact, Keynes argued that there are three distinct motives for preferring to hold wealth in the form of money as opposed to holding either non-money financial assets or physical assets.</p>
<p>Individuals need to hold money in order to meet daily transactions such as buying petrol, paying for groceries or purchasing a newspaper. Money balances held for this purpose is called transaction demand for money. Everyone will hold a certain amount of money since they are normally paid weekly or monthly whereas their expenditure is spread over the whole period. The average amount held for transactions purposes depends upon the level of money income, the price level, the time of the year and the frequency of paydays. In terms of money income, the higher the money income, the more likely the individual is to purchase more goods and services, and therefore require extra transactions balances. If the price level increases the demand for money for transactions purposes will be higher. In the case of the frequency of pay days, the more frequent, the lower the transactions demand for money.</p>
<p>The demand for money is also based on the desire to provide for the unexpected. The precautionary demand for money allows the individual to cover unforeseen events, such as the car breaking down, a lengthy period off work through illness, or an unexpected redundancy. It is likely to be the case that as the rate of interest increases, the precautionary demand for money will fall as individuals place their money in interest-bearing assets, i.e. the cost of 'holding' money has increased.</p>
<p>Money balances held for these two purposes is called active balances (L<sub>1</sub>) i.e. money to be used as a medium of exchange.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9ef89b4d49d9f0974688fda56a0773de" alt="" width="337" height="232"><br><br>Speculative demand for money is based on the expectation of making a speculative gain or avoiding a loss. Money balances held for this purpose are called idle balances (L<sub>2</sub>). Keynes outlined the speculative demand for money in terms of the desire to hold money or fixed income bonds. It is important to note that the price of bonds and the rate of interest are inversely related. When the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly high by individuals they will assume that the next move is in a downward direction. As stated, when the rate of interest falls the price of bonds increases and so there are capital gains to be made. This being so, when the rate of interest is high there will be a substantial demand for bonds and hence a low speculative demand to hold money. If, however, the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly low then individuals will assume that the next move is upwards, resulting in a fall in bond prices and, therefore, a capital loss for those who own bonds. If this is the case, the demand for bonds is likely to be low and those owning bonds will be looking to sell them before the price falls. In this situation the speculative demand for money will be high as shown in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1ad88190f7602cb1dd97d7b50df374ff" alt="" width="363" height="219"><br><br>The total demand for money LP is plotted against the rate of interest (r). This is found by the horizontal addition of curves L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/71ce6583a61b2240e0a4c6d02037b4df" alt="" width="432" height="231"></p>
<p>A change in interest rate causes movement along the demand for money curve upward or downward.</p>
<p>Any factor other than a change in interest rates, that causes the demand for money to change will shift the LP curve to the rightward or leftward. For example, a rise in national income or price level will cause L<sub>1</sub> to increase, and thus LP will shift to the right and vice versa.</p>
<p>An increase in unemployment is likely to decrease output and national income subsequently resulting in a fall in transaction demand for money as unemployed would be forced to cut back their spending. This possible reduction in consumer spending would affect firms' receipts and their liquidity hence it is expected to result in a fall in demand for money.</p>
<p>However, there may be offsetting changes in the economy which would prevent demand for money from falling. Government acting in terms of providing increasing unemployment benefit can lead to a stable demand for money or else credit availability in terms of greater use of credit cards can also compensate for a fall in incomes resulting from unemployment. Besides this some unemployment, e.g. seasonal, could be already accounted for in the determinants of liquidity preference hence would not affect liquidity preference.</p>
<p>Thus a rise in unemployment is expected to affect liquidity preference only in the absence of compensating factors.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 137</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8991</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the causes of unemployment.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Unemployment is defined as people who are out of work but, have actively looked for a job over the previous four weeks and who are available to work within the next two weeks. Unemployment can be expressed as a number or a percentage. Unemployment rate is the percentage of the work force that is unemployed. The work force can be defined as those who are employed and unemployed.</p>
<p>The causes of unemployment fall into two broad categories: Equilibrium unemployment (NRU) and disequilibrium unemployment (real wage unemployment). <br>Real wage unemployment or classical unemployment is where trade unions use their monopoly power to derive wages above the market clearing level, resulting in an excess supply of labour. Governments introducing minimum wage legislation could also cause it.</p>
<p>Even when there is no general disequilibrium in the economy at the current wage levels, there will still be some unemployment. This is also known as the natural rate of unemployment. For various reasons not all vacancies will be filled. The problem is one of the mismatching. There are various types of equilibrium unemployment.</p>
<p>Frictional unemployment is transitional unemployment due to people moving between jobs: For example, newly redundant workers or workers entering the labour market for instance, university graduates, may take time to find appropriate jobs at wage rates they are prepared to accept. Thus, many are unemployed for a short time whilst involved in job search. Imperfect information in the labour market may make frictional unemployment worse if the jobless are unaware of the available employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand or supply in the economy. People made redundant in one part of the economy due to a long run decline in demand in particular industries cannot immediately take up jobs in other parts or other industries. Hence, structural unemployment exists where there is a mismatch between their skills and the requirements of the new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for certain types of labour fluctuates with the seasons of the year. For instance, employment in fruit picking and holiday catering is seasonal in character. The difficulty is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are not substitutable.</p>
<p>Keynesian unemployment is referred to as demand deficient or cyclical unemployment. The term cyclical unemployment entails the alternate booms and slumps in the level of economic activity due to the fluctuations in aggregate demand. Unemployment increases when aggregate demand is too small, there being a deficiency of demand for goods and services. Since labour is a derived demand, the lack of demand for goods and services will also lead to a deficiency of demand for labour.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 138</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8989</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'We do not ask consumers what they want.

<p>Explain how, according to utility theory, consumers allocate their expenditure between different products as prices change.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Economists use the term utility for satisfaction that people derive from the consumption of goods and services. Total utility and marginal utility are two important measures of utility. Total utility is the total satisfaction a consumer gets from the consumption of all the units of a good consumed within a given time period. Whereas, marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from consuming one extra unit of a good within a given time period. It is measured by: TU<sub>n</sub> - TU<sub>n-1</sub> = MU</p>
<p>According to the principle of diminishing marginal utility, as more units of a good are consumed, an additional unit will provide less additional satisfaction than previous unit. For example, the second cup of coffee in the morning gives us less additional satisfaction than the first cup. The third cup gives even less satisfaction. The relationship between TU and MU is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e16bd2a14d82ea7a0030709e7810cf70" alt="" width="421" height="205"></p>
<p>The MU curve slopes downward, simply illustrating the principle of diminishing marginal utility. The TU curve starts at the origin. When MU is positive and diminishing, TU increases at a decreasing rate. TU reaches a peak when marginal utility is zero.</p>
<p>Marginal utility can be derived from the TU curve. It is the slope of the line joining two adjacent quantities on the curve. For example, the marginal utility of the third cup of coffee is the slope of the line joining points a and b. The slope of such a line is given by the formula: <br>MU = ΔTU/Δ units&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can use marginal utility analysis to show how a rational consumer decides what combination of goods to buy from the given incomes. Thus, it is not just a question of choosing between two obvious substitutes like carrots and peas, but about allocating our incomes between all the goods and services we might like to consume or for instance, if we have, say, an income of $1000 per month, what is the optimum bundle of goods and services for us to spend it on?</p>
<p>According to the equimarginal principle a rational consumer will get the highest utility from a given level of income when the utility from last $ spent on each good is the same. Algebraically, this is when:</p>
<p>MU<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>b</sub>/P<sub>b&nbsp;</sub>= MU<sub>c</sub>/P<sub>c&nbsp;</sub>= ......MU<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>n<br></sub></p>
<p>Where a , b, c ...... n are the various goods consumed.</p>
<p>What we are describing here is the way in which consumer will achieve the best value for money from their purchases.</p>
<p>The analysis assumes the following:</p>
<p>Satisfaction can be measured in utils. A util is an imaginary unit of satisfaction from the consumption of a good. Consumer is rational, and therefore wants to maximize satisfaction also his taste and preferences are constant. Consumer has a fixed income, and he will be spending on two normal goods X and Y, whereas prices of the two products are $2 and $1 respectively and are constant.</p>
<p>We also assume that satisfaction from the last unit of X consumed is three times as much as from the last unit of Y. We are in fact saying: <br>MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y</sub> &nbsp;is 3/1 &nbsp;and &nbsp; P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y</sub> &nbsp;is &nbsp;2/1<br>hence,&nbsp;MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y<br></sub></p>
<p>With the current bundle of X and Y consumer does not maximize satisfaction from the given income. Therefore, he must alter his purchase of the two commodities so that the Mu ratio is equal to the price ratio of these two commodities. For example, consumer must increase the purchase of good X relative to that of good Y. As he buys more of X, according to the principal of diminishing marginal utility, MUx falls. Likewise, as he buys less of Y MUy increases. The consumer will stop making adjustment when the MU ratio is the same as the price ratio.<sub> <br></sub></p>
<p>MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y</sub>=&nbsp;P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y</sub> &nbsp;i.e. &nbsp;2/1=2/1</p>
<p>At this point his TU will be maximized from a given amount of income spent on the two goods. Any further changes in the quantities of these two commodities will only reduce his TU.</p>
<p>Once attained, the ratio can be disturbed by the changes in prices of any of the two commodities or both. Say, for example, if Py increases from $1 to $2. Now the consumer will have to readjust his purchase of the two commodities to equate the two ratios. Let's consider the following situation.</p>
<p>MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y &nbsp;</sub>is &nbsp;2/1 &nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y</sub> &nbsp;is &nbsp;2/2 &nbsp;so &nbsp; &nbsp;MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>y</sub></p>
<p>Now the consumer must rearrange his bundle of the two commodities and he must buy less of Y so MU<sub>y</sub> rises or alternatively, he can increase the purchase of good X. As he buys more of X, MU<sub>x</sub> falls. The consumer will stop adjusting these quantities when the MU ratio again is equal to the new price ratio. <br>So, by spending his income according to the equimarginal principal a rational consumer maximizes (TU) satisfaction.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 139</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8988</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>A government stated that pay increases in the coming year should be kept to a minimum.

Many firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type of labour characterize this type of market. Also, there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect&nbsp;mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing horizontally the labor dernand curves (the marginal revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product, MRPL, is the increase in revenue due to employing one more unit of labour. MRPL is determined by the MPPL(marginal physical product of labour) multiplied by the MR i.e. <br>MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR.</p>
<p>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b302dd748ba9eda24f2f33b7d1d66008" alt="" width="432" height="190"></p>
<p>In the figure above, both the equilibrium wage rate and level of employment are determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves as shown in the left part of the graph. Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this type of labor up to the point at which its MRPL is equal to marginal cost of labour (MCL) as given in the right part of the graph.</p>
<p>Although economic theory of wage determination is primarily concerned with a perfectly competitive market, however, the theory could be extended to allow various market imperfections, such as trade unions and government intervention.</p>
<p>Trade unions are made up of groups of workers who have a common interest. Their objectives can range from improving the working environment to taking up the cases of those members the unions see as being unfairly dismissed. Their most important function is to increase the wage rate of its members.</p>
<p>Trade unions influence the market through collective bargaining. It involves the direct negotiation between a trade union and the employers. Successful collective bargaining in a perfectly competitive labour market could raise the wage rate from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>, as illustrated in figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/bfaf0552dcb2f3d4a023db7e1030eacb" alt="" width="355" height="247"></p>
<p>The trade union may be unwilling to supply labour below the wage rate of W<sub>2</sub>; therefore, the supply curve becomes W<sub>2</sub>AS<sub>L</sub>, being perfectly elastic over the section W<sub>2</sub>A. At the equilibrium wage of W<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">1</span>, with no trade union involvement, L<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">1</span> workers would be employed. However, with a wage of W<sub>2</sub>, only L<sub>2</sub> are demanded and therefore L<sub>3</sub> - L<sub>2</sub> are unable to find employment. There may be individuals who are willing to work for a wage below W<sub>2</sub> but they would be prevented from doing so by the union agreement.</p>
<p>Government fixing a minimum wage to protect largely non-unionised labour from being exploited by employers will produce the similar outcome. However in a modern mixed economy the government acts as a monopsonist, paying wages below the market equilibrium levels. This brings trade union and government into conflict. This can be explained by the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/72638c6d6393b85cf05b98f2be941463" alt="" width="376" height="269"></p>
<p>The government facing a large number of employees in the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">1</span> and restrict employment L<sub>1</sub>. The entry of a trade union to the industry, which sets a minimum wage of W<sub>2</sub>, will kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal cost curve of labour. The government, acting as a monopsonist, has an incentive to hire extra workers so long as the MRPL is higher than the MCL. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub> workers.&nbsp;<br>Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually employs more workers. It is only when the union forces the wage rate above W<sub>3</sub> that employment starts to fall.</p>
<p>However, successful wage negotiation depends on a number of factors. Firstly, a trade union enjoys better bargaining position when it is not easy for employer to substitute labour with capital. Secondly the elasticity of demand for the product that the firm produces is relatively low. Thirdly, the proportion of labour costs out of the total costs is low and majority of the workers belong to the union. Lastly, the suitable political and economic climate will add to their bargaining strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, trade unions can influence the wage rate both in public and private sector whereas government can influence the wage rate only in the public sector of the economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 140</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8987</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Analyse whether an increase in the wage rate always leads to an increase in the number of hours worked by an individual.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The wage increase not only influences the number of people in the labour force, but it also affects the number of hours worked for each worker. When workers sell their services to employers, they are giving up leisure in order to gain income with which to buy goods. They can therefore be thought of as trading leisure for higher income and hence goods.</p>
<p>Economic theory suggests that the real wage is a key determinant of the number of hours. The real wage is the money wage rate adjusted for changes in the price level and it measures the quantity of goods and services that can be bought from each hour worked. An increase in the real wage on offer in a job should lead to someone supplying more hours of work over a given period of time, although there is the possibility that further increases in the going wage rate might have little effect on an individual's labour supply. Indeed, there is the possibility of a backward-bending individual labour supply curve. This is illustrated in the figure below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/311b25b52961e9e03a53945de74c6200" alt="" width="434" height="302"></p>
<p>ln the figure above, higher real wages do lead to an increase in the number of extra hours supplied, although the rate at which the individual is prepared to give up his leisure time diminishes as the real wage rises. But the labour supply curve meets the standard prediction that higher wages attract people to work longer hours. But when as real wages step upwards, eventually an individual may choose to actually work fewer hours ( ceteris paribus) thus producing a "backward bending" labour supply curve.</p>
<p>In order to understand this we consider the income and substitution effects that arise from a change in the real wage being paid to an individual worker. We start with the income effect.</p>
<p>Higher real wages increase the income that someone can earn from a job, but they also mean that a target real wage can be achieved with fewer hours of labour supply. So this income effect might persuade people to work less hours and enjoy extended leisure time.</p>
<p>The substitution effect of a higher wage rate should unambiguously give people an incentive to work extra hours because the financial rewards of working are raised, and the opportunity cost of not working (measured by the wages given up when people opt for leisure instead) has increased.</p>
<p>The relative magnitude of these two effects determines the slope of the individual supply curve. It is normally assumed that the substitution effect outweighs the income effect, especially at lower wages thus producing an upward sloping supply curve. This can be noted on the upward sloping part of supply curve in the graph above where wage increase from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub> generates a positively sloping supply curve. However if the wage rate becomes high enough for the income effect to dominate, the supply curve will begin to slope backwards. This occurs above a wage rate of W<sub>2</sub>.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 141</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8986</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In March 2009, the government of France agreed to pay 250 million Euros to the car manufacturer Renault, which employed 63 000 workers, on condition that it would not reduce the number of French jobs or factories.

<li>Car manufacturers are likely to operate in an oligopolistic market structure. Oligopoly refers to a situation where there are a few firms in the market producing a large number of brands. Each firm is of a sufficiently large size that the decision taken by one firm will affect the decisions taken by the other firms in the market. The firms are, therefore, mutually dependent. It is an industry where there is a high level of market concentration. The concentration ratio measures the extent to which a market or industry is dominated by a few leading firms. This implies that the number of firms is small enough for each firm to realize that its competitors may respond to anything that it does and that it should take such possible responses into account. Therefore, there is no single theory of how firms determine price and output under conditions of oligopoly. <br><br>In addition to this an oligopoly exhibits product branding, entry barriers, interdependent decision-making and non-price competition. All of these features can be applied to the car industry. <br><br>In deciding on pricing strategies, oligopolists face a basic dilemma between competing and cooperating. Thus there is a possibility of price competition. If a price war breaks out, oligopolists will produce and price much as a perfectly competitive industry. But price wars prove to be costly therefore they are short lived. Due to the threat of price wars and the existence of effective alternative strategies, oligopolists may engage in non-price competition. This can take a number of different forms such as product differentiation, where oligopolists can, through advertising, create a brand image for their product. The firm may offer a particular after-sales service or package the product in a particular way. <br><br>However, there is much to be gained from cooperation in the form of collusion. Collusion is an agreement on price charged and level of output produced. Thus it makes it possible for oligopolists to act as a monopoly and to achieve maximum profits for the industry. <br><br>Collusion can take different forms. It can be a formal or overt collusion, with agreement being reached between the firms as to what price to charge or what output to produce. This type of formal agreement is known as a cartel and is illegal in many countries. The other type is called tacit collusion. This is where firms behave in a cooperative way but do not have a formal agreement. The most common form of tacit collusion is price leadership where price set by one firm becomes the benchmark for other firms. <br><br>Often the price leader in an oligopolistic market is the dominant firm. In this situation the largest or the most efficient firm takes the lead in setting the price which the other firms follow, possibly because they fear that not doing so would lead to a price war. <br><br>The other form of price leadership is called barometric price leadership. The price leader may be a small firm but one which has a close knowledge of the market and the prevailing economic conditions. In this situation the barometric firm may institute a price change which the other firms in the oligopolistic market follow. <br><br>Pricing strategy in a non-collusive oligopoly is explained by the kinked demand curve. The kinked demand curve assumes that a business might face a dual demand curve for its product based on the likely reactions of other firms in the market to a change in its price. The common assumption of the theory is that firms in an oligopoly are looking to protect and maintain their market share and that rival firms are unlikely to match another's price increase but may match a price fall. The graph below illustrates this situation. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4755c875d77191c8d38a1f17c1cc8917" alt="" width="517" height="324"><br><br>If a business raises price and others leave their prices constant, then we can expect quite a large substitution effect away from this firm making demand relatively price elastic. The business would then lose market share and expect to see a fall in its total revenue. <br><br>If a business reduces price but other firms follow suit, the relative price change is much smaller and demand would be inelastic in respect of the price change. Cutting prices when demand is inelastic also leads to a fall in total revenue with little or no effect on market share. The kinked demand curve model therefore makes a prediction that a business might reach a stable profitmaximising equilibrium at price P<sub>1</sub> and output Q<sub>1</sub> and have little incentive to alter prices. <br><br>A car industry can be characterized as oligopoly because there is low concentration of firms with a high degree of interdependence. Also firms have to decide about particular pricing and output decision after taking account of possible reactions of rival firms. There is scope of competition on price and even more on factors such as branding, quality variation, after sale services and advertisement.</li>
<li>Economic theory supports the idea of governments support on various grounds such as efficiency, economies of scale and research and development. Firstly large firms may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale due to larger plant, centralised administration and specialists' staff. Their growth and expansion of output over time leads to a reduction in the unit costs. These cost saving benefits are referred to as economies of scale. They occur because the firm's output rises proportionately faster than the inputs. These benefits come in a variety of ways known as technical, marketing, financial, managerial and risk bearing economies. Thus large firms will be better placed in terms of cost structure than the small firms. <br><br>Large firms are also viewed as improving welfare by avoiding unnecessary duplication of resources. For instance, a large gas company would eliminate the need for several sets of rival gas pipes under each street thus resulting in efficient allocation of resources. Particularly if this results in an MC curve substantially below that of the same industry with relatively small firms, then the large firm will produce a higher output at a lower price as illustrated by the graph below. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5da61eae8201f83278b4eb0836a6d400" alt="" width="400" height="257"><br><br>In figure above the large firm produces Q<sub>1</sub> at a price of P<sub>2.</sub> Comparing this with price P<sub>2</sub> and output Q<sub>2</sub> when market is shared by relatively smaller firms operating in a perfectly competitive market. Price will be even higher and output lower than what the larger firm produces. This is possible only when the large firm's MC curve is below point x. <br><br>Moreover, the large firm can use part of its supernormal profits for research and development and investment. It thus has a greater ability to become dynamically efficient than has the small firm with limited funds. Also, in a perfectly contestable market even the largest firm earns only normal profits and operates most efficiently. <br><br>Finally, macroeconomic theory also supports the idea of encouraging firms to grow in order to support particular regions and more importantly to stimulate growth. <br><br>However, if large firms are dominant then they usually adopt monopolistic behaviour. In practice a monopoly situation can arise when a firm has a dominant position in terms of its market share. This might be a cause of concern for government. <br><br>The classic case against the large firms is that their conduct and performance is undesirable when compared with that of small firms in a more competitive industry. This can be anlaysed with the help of the graph below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/433519126be27997d28e00e041c090c8" alt="" width="370" height="355"><br><br>Figure above compares the profit-maximising position for a dominating large firm with that of small firms. The large firm will produce MQ at a price of MPd. This is where MC = MR. If the same industry were shared by relatively small firms, it would produce at PCQ and charge the price PCPb. This is where industry supply equals industry demand. Thus large firm produces a lower output and charges a higher price. In doing so the firm captures consumer surplus and turns it into abnormal profit. This analysis is based on the assumption that the industry has the same AC and MC curves in case of both large and small firms. <br><br>Moreover, large firms result in limited choice available to consumer thus depriving consumers of variety that they would have enjoyed if there were large number of relatively small firms. Also large firms usually adopt predatory pricing to restrict competition and discriminatory pricing to appropriate consumer surplus. Both these pricing strategies are thought to work against the interest of consumers. <br><br>Large firms also create different barriers to entry which allow profits to remain supernormal even in the long run. The large firm, therefore, sheltered by barriers to entry, can still make large profits even if it is not using the most efficient technique. <br><br>Furthermore, large firm's average costs may increase in the long run with the firm experiencing diseconomies of scale. These diseconomies of scale come in a variety of different ways. For instance, as a firm grows in size it will possibly have a larger management team and, unlike a small firm, it will find it difficult to make decisions quickly. This can often be the case where companies have merged and there are two sets of management with different ideas. A 'them and us' situation may also develop between the management and the workforce, possibly resulting in an increase in the number of industrial disputes. It may be difficult to coordinate planning, marketing, production and so on, with a resulting increase in the company's cost per unit. <br><br>In conclusion economic theory neither completely supports government assistance to large firms nor does it completely rule this out. Rather economic theory suggests that the support by government to large firms should depend upon the specific information about the particular organization being discussed.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">Here are two accounts of the tourist industry in Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Article 1</strong><br>The Gambia, on the west coast of Africa, is ranked 160th out of 173 on the United Nations Human&nbsp;Development Index. Over half the population live on less than one US dollar a day and survive on&nbsp;subsistence agriculture and cannot compete with subsidised American farmers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, things are changing as The Gambia expands its tourist sector, which is now a significant part&nbsp;of the national economy, accounting for 7.8 % of GDP. It employs 5000 directly and creates work for&nbsp;6000 others. Large European tour operators play a vital role in marketing, assuring quality, and providing&nbsp;flights and accommodation. Tourism has the major advantage that developed countries cannot place tariff&nbsp;barriers on tourist exports. Tourists spend on average US $40 to US $50 a day on meals, souvenirs,&nbsp;crafts and tours. One third is spent in the informal sector, where income is not recorded, providing a&nbsp;livelihood for taxi drivers, craft workers and local guides.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, there are disadvantages. Tourism is highly seasonal, and tour operators negotiate low prices&nbsp;which keep profit margins low - so low, in fact, that many hotels have closed because they could not&nbsp;cover costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Article 2</strong><br>A union official in Tanzania said that the tourism sector is expanding in Tanzania but the return to the&nbsp;country's economy is low and the benefit to the workers is about 0.5 % of the total industry's income.&nbsp;In the hotels the lowest wages are around US $50 a month, from which tax and rent have to be deducted.&nbsp;Someone who has been working 5 years or more receives no extra pay or promotion. Contracts are shortterm&nbsp;lasting for a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hotel operators oppose workers joining trade unions. Most tour operators come from outside Tanzania.&nbsp;Only 10 % of each US dollar earned by the tourist industry remains in the country, and most of that&nbsp;goes to the management not the workers. Top managers are usually foreign workers paid two or three&nbsp;times as much as a Tanzanian manager.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="text-align: left;">What evidence is there that The Gambia is a developing country?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">What does Article 1 mean when it says that tourism created work for 6000 others?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Article 2 mentions the low pay of hotel workers. Why might many hotel workers receive low pay?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Does the evidence provided enable you to conclude that tourism merely exploits resources and is of little&nbsp;benefit?</li>
</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Poor or materially backward countries are known as developing countries. The pieces&nbsp;of evidence in the article are subsistence agriculture, more than half population surviving&nbsp;on less than a dollar per day, HDI ranking is 160 out of 173, informal sector and&nbsp;the role of large European tour operators in making all necessary arrangements for&nbsp;tourists, all indicate that Gambia is a developing country. Subsistence agriculture and&nbsp;informal sector imply that Gambia is dependent on poorly organised production of&nbsp;primary products and is unable to compete with the subsidized farmers of developed&nbsp;nations. Less than a dollar per day is a widely accepted criteria of poverty and more&nbsp;than half population of Gambia falls in this category, a clear indication that Gambia&nbsp;is plagued with mass poverty. This is further confirmed by the HDI ranking of the&nbsp;country.<br><br></li>
<li>Tourism not only creates jobs in businesses directly related to the industry for example, tour managers, but part of the money spent by tourists goes to the businesses not classified as tourists businesses themselves, such as restaurants, craft workers, taxi drivers and local tour guides. Since tourism is a source of injection into the economy therefore, it will have a multiplier effect on aggregate expenditure. Money spent by tourists will create incomes for all those directly related to the tourists businesses, some of which will, in tum, be spent and thereby create more jobs and further incomes in different sectors of the economy. Hence, money spent by tourists results, not only, in an increase in incomes of tourists related businesses, but stimulates further spending elsewhere and creates more jobs.<br><br></li>
<li>Like all other developing countries Tanzania may have a large pool of unskilled unemployed workers available. This excess supply of unskilled workers in underdeveloped countries forces wages to remain low. It is mentioned in the extract that the workers in the industry are employed on contract basis, maximum for one year, The article further mentions that the industry is dependent on tourist season which normally does not last throughout the year. Employers also discourage workers to join trade unions in order to weaken their bargaining power. There is no indication of the minimum wage enforced by the authorities. But there is ample evidence in the articles that the labour market is informal and the workers' bargaining power is week. <br><br>The extract clearly indicates that the labour market is imperfect, where the wages set by the employers are low and conditions of employment favour more to employers than workers. This situation can be illustrated by the graph shown below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0340cd87b68e5d6332941763071d0c86" alt="" width="291" height="252"><br><br>The dominant employer will hire workers by equating MRP and MFC. The wage that the employer pays is Wm. This is actually below the wage that should be paid if he was paying the full value of their MRP that is Wmrp. In this situation the power of the employer is of over-riding importance and the employer can set a low wage and all other conditions of employment mainly due to their buying power.<br><br></li>
<li>For a poor and underdeveloped economy, such as Gambia, growth in tourism brings many benefits. As mentioned in article 1 that tourism accounts for a direct contribution of 7.5% to the GDP. Its indirect contribution can be even more significant. It created an estimated 11000 jobs directly or indirectly, that will also lead to a multiple increase in employment and national income. Government also benefits from higher tax revenue due to increasing economic activities. <br><br>In article 2 the share of Tanzanian economy from expanding tourism is low and to the workers is only 0.5%. The average wages are 50$ per month of which deductions have to be made for taxes and rent, which, by any standards is very low. <br><br>Both these articles present two different aspects of tourism, hence, they represent different point of views. Article 1 is more optimistic and highlights positive effects of tourism on employment generation in a poverty stricken economy. Whereas, article 2 is written by a union leader whose perspective seems to be more dominated by the notion of labour exploitation. <br><br>This perception of exploitation depends on who is being asked their opinion. Employers may have a different point of view and would see their role as more of bringing economic benefits to these countries by attracting tourists and hence generating employment for unskilled workers, who may not have alternative job opportunities. They would disagree with the views of unionists that they do not give fair share and exploit labour. On the contrary they would argue that their economic contribution to these economies is immensely significant. Similarly workers in the rural areas with no alternative jobs may feel fortunate to be employed than no employment at all. The tourists may also prefer these countries for their vacations due to lower cost. Higher wages would make these countries less attractive and therefore tourists may turn to alternative destinations. The economic managers might see growth in tourism sector as an economic opportunity. <br><br>On the other hand the unionist may not be convinced by these arguments, as their perspective is more dominated by bargaining for maximum share for workers. According to them workers are not being given a fair share out of the total earnings from tourism as stated in article 2. <br><br>Exploitation occurs when workers are not paid fairly. Fairness is a relative term, therefore depends on value judgement. Different people involved in the industry are bound to have varying opinions, therefore the meanings of exploitation purely depends on the perception of who is being asked their opinion .</li>

Government policy and methods of intervention can be summarized under four broad headings: regulation, financial intervention, direct provision and improving information. The method chosen will depend to a large extent on its effectiveness under the given circumstances.</p>
<p>The government uses a large number of methods of regulation as a means of controlling a market. Legal and other methods are used to control the quality and quantity of goods and services that are under and over produced by the market forces. For example, the government may regulate the sale of certain drugs by making them only available on prescription from a qualified doctor. Hygiene laws set standards for the production of foods. There may be controls on shop opening hours or the setting of a minimum age at which a person can buy certain products, such as alcohol, cigarettes and lottery tickets. Other forms of regulation may include the requirement for an individual to purchase an insurance policy before being legally permitted to drive a car, the age at which people are required to attend school and the payment of social insurance contributions.</p>
<p>Regulation may not only apply to the quantity and quality of goods and services sold but may also refer to prices. Examples of price controls include minimum wage legislation and rent controls.</p>
<p>Finally, the government has powers to control abuse of monopoly power through regulatory organisations such as the Competition Commission (CC) or bodies set up to investigate and regulate production and pricing policies by monopolies particularly in public utilities such as telecommunications, water, electricity and gas. The laws of competition policy act against examples of pricefixing cartels or other forms of anti-competitive behaviour by firms within markets. Regulation may be used to introduce fresh competition into a market - for example breaking up the existing monopoly power of a service provider. This is known as market liberalisation. Apart from being costly their effectiveness depends on adrninistrative control of the authorities. Administratively weak governments will not be able to achieve the desired objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial tools, such as taxes or subsidies, are also frequently used by governments to influence production, prices of commodities.</p>
<p>Financial intervention means the use of indirect tax and subsidy to achieve optimum allocation of resources. Indirect taxes such as changes in VAT and excise duties can be used to raise the price of demerit goods and products with negative externalities. This is particularly designed to increase the opportunity cost of consumption and thereby reduce consumer demand towards a socially optimal level.</p>
<p>Subsidies to consumers will lower the price of merit goods such as grants to students to reduce the internal costs of staying on in full-time education. They are designed to boost consumption and output of products with positive externalities. While a subsidy to businesses causes an increase in market supply and leads to a lower equilibrium price and higher quantity. The effectiveness of taxes and subsidies depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply.</p>
<p>In addition to providing the finance it is also possible for a government to take over the production of a good or service, either in whole or in part. State-owned industries are often referred to as nationalized industries such as the electricity, coal mining and railway industries are entirely owned and managed by the state in many countries. It is also very common to find some goods and services being produced by both the state and the private sectors. Education and health care are particularly good examples of these types of service.</p>
<p>Often market failure results from consumers suffering from a lack of information about the costs and benefits of the products available in the market place. Government action can have a role in improving information to help consumers and producers value the 'true' cost and/ or benefit of a good or service. <br>Examples might include compulsory labeling on cigarette packages with health warnings to reduce smoking or else improved nutritional information on high-fat foods to counter the risks of growing obesity.</p>
<p>These programmes are designed to change the perceived costs and benefits of consumption for the consumer. They don't have any direct effect on market prices, but they seek to influence demand and therefore the level of final output and consumption.</p>
<p>In conclusion government can use any and all of the measures discussed above in order to improve allocation of resources. The choice depends on the objective and the relative effectiveness of different measures in the given situation.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 144</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8983</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>In a two-country world, one country is more efficient&nbsp;at producing one product and the other country is more&nbsp;efficient at producing another product. Explain why&nbsp;specialisation and trade usually benefit both countries.</li>
<li>Suppose one country is more efficient at producing both&nbsp;products. Discuss whether it is the case that&nbsp;specialisation and trade will always benefit both countries.</li>
</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Adam Smith argued that trade between two countries&nbsp;would be beneficial so long as one country has absolute&nbsp;advantage in producing one product over the other. A&nbsp;country is said to have absolute advantage in the&nbsp;production of a good when it is more efficient in&nbsp;producing that good as compared to the other country.&nbsp;In other words that country can actually produce the&nbsp;good by using fewer resources or it can produce a higher&nbsp;output from the same resources than the other country.&nbsp;This advantage arises mainly due to the differences in&nbsp;factor endowments, traditions and technology.<br>The concept of absolute advantage may be illustrated&nbsp;by using a two-country two-commodity model.&nbsp;Furthermore we assume that there are no trade barriers&nbsp;and there is negligible transportation cost. We also&nbsp;assume that there is perfect mobility of resources within&nbsp;each of the two countries and the products that both&nbsp;countries produce are of similar quality.<br>In order to explain this concept let's assume that there&nbsp;are only two countries A and B and they produce only&nbsp;two goods tractors and wool. Also each country has&nbsp;two units of resources that it divides equally for production&nbsp;of these two goods. Following table shows the&nbsp;output of both countries before trade:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/614af939c9e7c4be2bdff0151ca935a3" alt="" width="347" height="186"><br><br>Clearly country A is more efficient in the production of&nbsp;tractors because it can produce 100 tractors per unit of&nbsp;resource as compared to 50 tractors per unit of resource&nbsp;in country B. Country A, therefore, is said to have an&nbsp;absolute advantage in tractors while the same principle&nbsp;suggests that country B has absolute advantage in wool.&nbsp;So the combine output of the two countries before&nbsp;specialization and trade is 150 units of tractors and 150&nbsp;units of wool. Assuming constant opportunity cost, each&nbsp;country then specializes in the production of the good&nbsp;in which it has absolute advantage, and then the total&nbsp;output will be as follows:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/90523baa65e19a0764633ba969e098ce" alt="" width="343" height="182"><br><br>Comparing the total output before and after specialization&nbsp;it can be noted that there is an increase of 50 units&nbsp;of each of the two goods which, the two countries can&nbsp;share between them and therefore would benefit from&nbsp;trade. However, for both countries to benefit from trade&nbsp;the terms of trade must be settled between their opportunity&nbsp;cost ratios. It, however, depends on the bargaining&nbsp;power of each of the two countries.</li>
<li>When a country has an absolute advantage in a product&nbsp;over the other country, the gains from trade are obvious.&nbsp;But what if one country can produce all commodities&nbsp;more efficiently than other countries? The answer&nbsp;underlies the theory of comparative advantage and is&nbsp;still accepted by economists today as a valid statement&nbsp;of the potential gains from trade.<br>The theory of comparative advantage suggests that gains&nbsp;from trade arise mainly because different nations have&nbsp;been endowed with different resources that result in&nbsp;different opportunity costs. For a nation, the opportunity&nbsp;cost is the amount of another good that must be&nbsp;sacrificed in order to produce a unit of a good.<br>So according to the theory a country is said to have&nbsp;comparative advantage in a good that it can produce at&nbsp;a lower opportunity cost than another country. Moreover&nbsp;if each country specializes in production of a good&nbsp;in which it has comparative advantage than the result is&nbsp;increased total output. Therefore both countries can&nbsp;benefit if they trade with one another at an exchange&nbsp;rate that lies between their opportunity cost ratios. An&nbsp;example will help to make this point.<br>Let's assume that there are only two countries&nbsp;involved&nbsp;in trade, say, Pakistan and Iran and each can produce&nbsp;just two products textiles and steel. Also, opportunity&nbsp;costs are constant for each product, there is perfect&nbsp;mobility of resources within each of the two countries&nbsp;and they have perfect knowledge. In addition to these&nbsp;we also assume that transport costs are zero and there&nbsp;are no restrictions on trade. Following table summarizes&nbsp;production possibilities of these two countries of two&nbsp;products before specialization and trade:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9f8292d37c958ee5e80a6bcf5543a6a2" alt="" width="297" height="142"><br><br>If it is assumed that all resources are fully employed&nbsp;then it is only possible to produce one more unit of a&nbsp;commodity if resources are reallocated from the production&nbsp;of the other commodity. In Iran, for instance, production&nbsp;of one more unit of steel requires 2 units of&nbsp;textiles to be sacrificed, thus giving an opportunity cost&nbsp;ratio 1 : 2. In case of Pakistan the production of one&nbsp;more unit of steel requires 5 units of textiles to be&nbsp;sacrificed, the opportunity cost ratio therefore is 1 : 5.&nbsp;These ratios are summarized in the following table.<br><br>
<table style="width: 626.6px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 92px;">Country</td>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 257px;">Opportunity cost of&nbsp;one unit of steel. <br>&nbsp;Steel : textiles</td>

</table>
<br>Difference in the opportunity costs means that there are&nbsp;benefits to be obtained from specialization and trade at&nbsp;an exchange rate that lies between their opportunity cost&nbsp;ratios. There is no advantage and therefore, no gain to&nbsp;be made from trade if the opportunity costs are identical.<br>The opportunity cost of producing steel is higher in&nbsp;Pakistan (5 units of textile), than in Iran (2 units of&nbsp;textile) thus Iran has a comparative advantage in steel.<br>For textiles opportunity cost is higher in Iran ( 1/2 units&nbsp;of steel) than in Pakistan ( 1/5 units of steel), hence&nbsp;Pakistan has a comparative advantage in textiles. If trade&nbsp;is possible at some relative prices between their opportunity&nbsp;costs of production, say 1 unit of steel for 3&nbsp;units of textiles, then Pakistan can obtain one unit of&nbsp;steel by sacrificing 3 units of its textiles which is less&nbsp;than its domestic opportunity cost. Similarly, Iran specializing&nbsp;in steel will be able to obtain more than 2 units&nbsp;of textiles for its one unit of steel. As a result specialization&nbsp;would result in both countries to consume higher&nbsp;quantities of goods that they import s compared to what&nbsp;they can produce by themselves.<br>Although the example leads to the clear conclusion that&nbsp;specialization and then trade will make both countries&nbsp;better off yet in the real world in some situations countries&nbsp;might prefer not to specialize and trade.<br>The theory, for instance, is based on weak assumption&nbsp;that an increase of output is followed by constant costs.&nbsp;In reality if increased output results in an increased cost&nbsp;of production, the comparative advantage will be&nbsp;reduced, and in some cases it may even disappear. Trade&nbsp;in those cases might not be possible. Similarly trade&nbsp;benefits both countries only if transportation cost is&nbsp;relatively lower than its potential benefits. If, for&nbsp;instance, transport cost is higher than the potential&nbsp;benefit from trade then possibility of trade is ruled out.<br>Also the assumption of perfect mobility of factors of&nbsp;production is considered weak because factors do not&nbsp;move freely from one industry to another and/or from&nbsp;one region to another. If, for instance, the government&nbsp;in a country anticipates that specialization and trade&nbsp;could result in high unemployment say due to the&nbsp;immobility of workers between occupations or regions&nbsp;then it may decide against specialization and trade.<br>Furthermore, some industries or sectors such as defense&nbsp;and food production may be considered strategically&nbsp;important therefore the countries might adopt the policy&nbsp;of self sufficiency even when they have a comparative&nbsp;disadvantage in those goods. In addition to this, factors&nbsp;such as rising social costs, political influences and&nbsp;obligations of trade agreements might result in a country&nbsp;to limit its trade with other countries.<br>The theory of comparative advantage remains an important&nbsp;economic concept because it is reflected in international&nbsp;relative prices that determine what goods a country&nbsp;should import and export and more importantly how&nbsp;countries benefit when they trade.

It is based on the theme that market forces of demand and supply are a very effective mechanism for coordinating decisions of millions of consumers and produces. The essence of market forces is that the price is determined where demand equals supply and thus resources are allocated in the optimal manner. That is, prices would equal marginal cost for all products, a necessary condition for allocative efficiency. Also firms keep production costs as low as possible to obtain highest profit margin hence, productive efficiency will occur. Such results, however, can only be obtained with perfect markets and perfect information.</p>
<p>Market forces do all the good things that we have discussed; yet there are many situations in which these forces do not produce the best outcomes. In these cases we say that markets have failed.</p>
<p>Market failure exists when the competitive outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. The result is a loss of economic and social welfare. This is usually because the benefits that the free-market confers on individuals or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits to the society as a whole.</p>
<p>We now examine the situations in which the market forces fail to achieve optimum allocation of scarce resources.</p>
<p>The first of these situations occurs when firms facing downward sloping demand curves - whether a monopoly or firms in an imperfect market - will maximize profits at an output where price exceeds marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. This is shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/69ac35340ba346e0d2324cbae2f85bfd" alt="" width="335" height="201"></p>
<p>Under perfect competition the price is determined by market demand and supply forces, hence Pp is the market price and the industry will sell Qp output. The industry is said to achieve allocative efficiency because P = MC. On the other hand a monopolist, for instance, will produce where MC = MR. Thus it produces Qm output and will sell this at Pm price. Clearly the monopolist produces where MC&lt; P, hence there is inefficient allocation of resources. Thus the firm with market power uses fewer resources and produces less output than the perfectly competitive industry. Also this lack of competition reduces welfare of consumers because they have a little choice available. So, overall society will be worse off.</p>
<p>When it comes to find out who wins and who loses in this particular situation we need to analyse consumer and producer surplus. Consumer surplus is the area between the price and demand curve i.e. areas 1+2+3 when the market is perfectly competitive. Producer surplus is the area between the price and MC. i.e. areas 4+5 in perfect market. In a monopoly situation the consumer surplus is only area 1 i.e. loss of surplus by the areas 2+3. Thus consumers are the losers. Monopolist's producer surplus is areas 2+4. This is clearly a larger surplus than under perfect competition because area 2 is larger than area 5, thus monopolist gains.</p>
<p>Besides this, monopoly has resulted in a loss of total surplus of areas 3+5. This is known as dead weight loss of monopoly and reduces the welfare of the whole society.</p>
<p>Besides imperfect markets, the existence of externalities also causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer benefits on others that are not involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem created by externalities is that market forces will lead to either too little or too much production. With a positive externality, a competitive free market will produce too little of the good and with a negative externality it produces too much of the good. Thus the presence of externalities, even when all markets are perfectly competitive, leads to allocatively inefficient outcomes.</p>
<p>Firms win again because the market forces fail to take account of external costs imposed on society and therefore, the producers get away without paying external costs. People who get affected by the decisions of firms are losers.</p>
<p>Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto the other party. The other party loses because they do not have the same information. More generally, whenever either party to a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency.</p>
<p>Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how good or bad a particular product is for them: either they do not have the right information or they simply lack some relevant information. The problem is that their existence will cause market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of the product being produced or consumed. In this case as well the producers usually have more information of the effects than consumers therefore consumer are usually seen to make inappropriate consumption, thus they lose.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 146</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8981</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>Income, Spending and Prices in the US<br></strong></p>

<p>Consumer spending in the US fell by 0.8% in November 2008 and by a further 1% in December. December 2008 was the sixth consecutive month in which consumers cut back on their spending. Between October and December 2008 spending fell by a record 8.9%. Consumers were in a mood to increase their savings but not to go out and spend. Generally, that's a good thing, but not when everyone does it at the same time. By January 2009, the savings rate in the US had reached the highest it had been for 14 years. This increase 5 in savings was caused by low consumer confidence and the fear of higher unemployment. <br>Declining consumer spending is a particularly troubling sign for the US economy, because spending accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP. GDP fell by 3.9% between October and December 2008, the sharpest decline in 26 years.</p>
<p>This decline in spending resulted in<br>-&nbsp;a proposed $888 billion stimulus plan from the government, including about $278 billion in tax cuts, <br>-&nbsp;companies reducing their workforce to cut costs because of falling revenue, <br>-&nbsp;the expectation that business investment, which accounts for about one-tenth of US GDP, would decline during 2009.</p>

<li>December 2008 registered a decline in personal income, consumer spending and prices. But there was a positive turn around in Jan. 2009 in all three variables. Consumer spending rose by 1% in Jan. and continued to rise in Feb. 2009, though only by 0.2%. Consumer prices also responded positively and rose in the first two months of 2009. Third and all important is personal income that registered an increase of 0.2% in Jan. However it fell by 0.2% in Feb. Over all there was some improvement in the US economy, although this was offset by a fall in personal income in Feb.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Overall the data provided on personal income and consumer spending is inconsistent. There is no obvious consistency between the two variables in terms of percentage changes which remained higher for consumer prices than those of consumer spending. There is some consistency in the direction for Nov. Dec. and jan. but the direction of change is inconsistent for the month of Feb. Even if spending is considered in the subsequent month to the income change the data is inconsistent.</li>
<li>Both consumer spending and consumer prices fell and rose consistently. Thus the two are consistent in the direction of change in the same month. However, except for Dec.2008 when both fell by 1 %, the percentage changes are different in other months.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Businesses invest only when they think it will be profitable. Higher consumer spending leading to the growing sales and expanding profits give firms both incentives and greater finances to invest. While a fall in consumer spending in general will cause a fall in demand for all goods and services. Businesses will have falling sales and hence a decline in their profits. If this decline in sales and profits are significant and the decision makers expect the trend to continue then there will be less revenue with which to invest and more importantly no incentive for businesses to invest.</li>
<li>A rise in saving could mean more funds available to lend which might allow investment to rise and economy to grow. However, if everyone saves more then consequently they spend less. Increased saving and low spending affects businesses. Less spending means less demand for goods and services and therefore lost orders for firms. Firms will cut back production and lay off workers. So the income of household will fall. This phenomenon is called paradox of thrift and is illustrated by the graph below:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/3e0489ca6a7dde4fde92a5ddbb3652bb" alt="" width="295" height="177"><br>An increase in savings at all levels of income will lead to an upward shift in the savings function. Equilibrium income will fall from OA to OB. We know from the multiplier that the resulting fall in national income will be greater than the fall in spending because this means reduced injections into the economy as people spend less. Thus extra saving and less consumption would only make matters worse by lowering income and increasing unemployment. <br><br>Rising unemployment will affect the fiscal measures of government. Government would receive less revenue from taxes and probably would have to increase spending for supporting unemployed. The data mentions that US government is proposing to reduce taxes. This might boost consumer spending but this will require government to switch expenditure from elsewhere or abandon the funding of some other important projects. Subsequently the government would have to increase taxes at some point in future.<br> <br>In conclusion if rising savings are matched by increasing investment then national income is likely to increase. However if rising savings are not offset by increase in injections then national income is likely to decrease by a higher proportion due to the multiplier effect.</li>

<p>Discuss whether an efficient allocation of resources can be obtained only if large-scale investment is undertaken by the public sector rather than the private sector.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The term efficiency in economics is to do with using scarce resources in the most effective way possible to meet the highest possible level of infinite wants. The best possible use of resources implies that two different types of efficiency are being achieved, namely productive and allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency is to do with using least possible scarce resources to produce any particular product hence it entails that production takes place at the lowest possible cost. Whereas allocative efficiency refers to the apportionment of scarce resources among firms and industries to obtain the production of the products most wanted by society.</p>
<p>Productive efficiency does not ensure efficient allocation of resources however productive efficiency must be used to provide society with the "right goods"(the goods consumers most want). There would be little merit in an economy that produced many products at very low cost that nobody particularly wanted and yielded little satisfaction.</p>
<p>ln order to locate the efficient point on an economy's production possibility curve economists recommend marginal analysis i.e. marginal benefit and marginal cost of producing each product. At the outset we need to understand that the price of a product reflects marginal benefit derived from the good whereas society's sacrifice of goods that could have been produced instead represents marginal cost. Hence it follows that in an economy efficient allocation of resources takes place when, for each good produced, its marginal cost of production is equal to the value that people place (P) on the last unit of the same product i.e. P = MC.</p>
<p>A large-scale investment on infrastructure building programme proposed by the World Bank, will have dynamic and far reaching effects on the level of economic activities in an economy. Usually these types of programmes are designed to consolidate the basis with which the economic activities can be integrated in future.</p>
<p>For instance, with the availability of roads and railway network, speedy and timely transportation is made possible therefore, shortages and surpluses in commodities and labour markets are quickly removed. Thus a well developed infrastructure is essential for efficient working of markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether large scale investment by the private sector on infrastructure can prove to be allocatively efficient depends on the level of competition in industries. If industries operate in a perfectly competitive environment where profit motivated firms produce each good or service to the point where price (marginal benefit) and marginal cost are equal, society's resources are allocated efficiently. The competitive system not only maximizes profits for individual producers but simultaneously results in a pattern of resource allocation which maximizes consumer satisfaction. The invisible hand thus organizes the private interests of producers in a way that is fully in accord with society's interest in allocating scarce resources efficiently.</p>
<p>However there are industries in which the degree of competition may be low. The clearest case is of natural monopoly - an industry in which scale effects are so dominant that there is room for at most one firm to operate at the minimum efficient scale. They are found mainly in public utilities such as electricity transmission cable television and local telephone services. One response to such industries is for government to assume ownership of the single firm and invest.</p>
<p>In these cases government appoints managers and directors who are supposed to set prices where efficient allocation of resources is achieved. Another response to this is to allow private ownership but to regulate the behaviour of monopolist.</p>
<p>But the opponents of government involvement in large scale infrastructural building programme argue that even with good intentions governments seldom get their policy application correct. The pursuit of self-interest amongst politicians and civil servants can often lead to a misallocation of resources. For example decisions about where to build new road and railway network may be decided with at least one eye to the political consequences. The pressures of a looming election or the influence exerted by special interest groups can foster an environment in which inappropriate spending decisions are made. e.g. boosting welfare spending in the run up to an election, or bringing forward major items of capital spending on infrastructural projects without the projects being subjected to a full and proper cost-benefit analysis. Often a government will choose to go ahead with a project or policy without having the full amount of information required for a proper cost-benefit analysis. The result can be inefficient allocation of resources and damaging long-term consequences.</p>
<p>Whether the government owns or merely regulates such organizations, the pricing policy is determined by the government. The firms are typically required to follow a pricing policy that conflicts with their goal of profit maximization. When government dictates that the dominant organizations set prices equal to marginal cost. In principle at least marginal cost pricing induces the allocatively efficient level of output. However, it is difficult to regulate the firms as marginal cost cannot be measured with precision.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 148</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8979</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>A World Bank report in 2007 commented on the continuing need for major spending worldwide on infrastructure on everything from roads and railways to water and electricity generation.</p>
<p>Explain the effect on national income when there is an increase in spending on infrastructure.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An increase in spending on infrastructure will act as a rise in injections into the circular flow of national income. However, this increase in injections is expected to have a more extensive effect upon total economic activity. Strictly in economic terms, the resulting increase in national income is likely to be more than the rise in injections through what is known as the multiplier effect.</p>
<p>The theory of multiplier is all important in economic analysis for it shows how a change in injections or leakages will influence national income. This can be described as the ratio of a change in equilibrium national income to the change in injections, usually denoted by "K" and stated as follows:</p>
<p>K = (ΔNY) / ΔJ &nbsp;&nbsp;or by rearranging our equation, we can say that: ΔNY = K x ΔJ</p>
<p>So for instance, if $5 billion increase in spending led to a $10 billion rise in NY then the size of K = 2.</p>
<p>The rationale underlying the multiplier effect is that the economy has continuous flows of expenditure and income through which money spent by an individual is received as income by another. It follows that an initial change in spending will cause a spending chain reaction which, although of diminishing importance at each successive step, will cumulate to a multiple change in NY.</p>
<p>To illustrate the multiplier process let's consider an example of an open economy with government. Furthermore we assume that there are unemployed resources in the country and marginal propensity to save is 0,2, marginal propensity to tax is 0.2 and marginal propensity to import is 0.1. It follows that marginal propensity to withdraw (MPW) = 0.5. MPW is the proportion of an increase in NY that is withdrawn from the circular flow.</p>
<p>Where MPW = MPS + MPT + MPM. This means that out of every $100 increase in income $50 are withdrawn in the form of saving, taxes and imports from the circular flow of NY and the remaining $50 are spent on local products. Hence marginal propensity to consume (MPC) = 0.5.</p>
<p>To get an idea how a larger increase in income results from a given increase in spending. We can follow the progress of the increased injection around the circular flow of money as shown in the table below;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1105b1d47c05a68ab5ce91696ed4d11c" alt="" width="384" height="267"></p>
<p>If say, $10 billion are spent on developing infrastructure. This will create employment for thousands of engineers, technicians and workers who are directly or indirectly involved in infrastructure building. Initially the $10 billion spending generates an equal amount of wage, rent interest and profits because spending and receiving income are two sides of the same transaction.</p>
<p>The new employees will now have wages, profits will have increased, and total income will have risen by the $10 billion. If we assume MPC = 1/2 and MPL 1/2, we know households will spend $2.5 billion and the remaining $2.5 billion will be withdrawn as savings, imports and taxes. The addition to consumption further increases aggregate demand. This time the firms producing consumer goods find sales rising and stocks falling. They will increase output, take on more labour, pay more in wages and earn more profit. If we continue to calculate increase in expenditure occurring as a result of this expansion in the economy we will be able to calculate final change in NY. The effect is shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/84cf4e4d8033fcfe481da36f87a16878" alt="" width="454" height="163"></p>
<p>An increase in spending on infrastructure will raise the level of injections from J&nbsp;to J<sub>1</sub>. Equilibrium will move from point a to point b. National income thus rises from Ye to Ye<sub>1</sub>. The multiplier is therefore:</p>
<p>K = ΔY / ΔJ</p>
<p>Hence it follows that a major spending on infrastructure will cause a spending chain through the economy. That chain of spending. although of diminishing magnitude at each successive step will cumulate to a multiple change in national income.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 149</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8978</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>Economists define money as anything that is generally&nbsp;acceptable in purchasing goods or settling debts. In a&nbsp;modem economy it consists of notes and coins and&nbsp;various kinds of bank deposits. Generally economists&nbsp;measure supply of money in narrow and broad terms.&nbsp;Narrow money consists of all the purchasing power that&nbsp;is immediately available for spending. It is, therefore,&nbsp;measured in terms of notes and coins in circulation. Broad&nbsp;money, however, adds near money to narrow money.&nbsp;Near money is anything that performs some functions&nbsp;of money - various types of bank deposits, for&nbsp;instance, used as a store of value.<br>In order to perform its functions with a great deal of&nbsp;effectiveness money must possess certain features. The&nbsp;paper currency issued by the states in modem economies&nbsp;is called fiat money because it is based on the faith&nbsp;of the public in its value. Also these notes and coins&nbsp;issued by the state are called legal tender. It implies that&nbsp;the currency issued by the state is recognized in the law&nbsp;as an acceptable medium of exchange and a medium for&nbsp;payment of debts. So this legal status of money makes&nbsp;it acceptable in general.<br>Money derives its value not only from its legal status&nbsp;but also from its scarcity i.e. value of money lies in its&nbsp;capacity to be exchanged for goods and services, now&nbsp;or in future. Therefore, general acceptability of money&nbsp;in modern economies lies in its being scarce and relatively&nbsp;stable in value.<br>Economists also consider durability as another important&nbsp;attribute of modern form of money. Durability is&nbsp;a problem that may affect paper currency. The main&nbsp;form of money in a modern society, however, is in the&nbsp;form of bank deposits that exist only as digits in&nbsp;computer. It is, therefore, considered durable as it&nbsp;suffers no physical depreciation can be transmitted&nbsp;electronically from one place to another. Even cash is&nbsp;attributed with a higher degree of portability.<br>Divisibility is another feature of modern form of money.&nbsp;It refers to the states issuing money in various denominations&nbsp;so that people spend just enough that they need&nbsp;to in order to buy a certain product.<br>Homogeneity is also a notable feature. Money in modern&nbsp;economies acts effectively because it is uniform and&nbsp;therefore, people recognize it easily. If it is not uniform&nbsp;then according to the Gresham law "bad money drives&nbsp;out good money".&nbsp;<br>Lastly, the money in the modern economies consists of&nbsp;paper currency that has only exchange value and no&nbsp;intrinsic value, therefore it is essential that the possibilities&nbsp;for fraud and counterfeit be kept to the minimum.&nbsp;Modern currency notes are issued with certain signs&nbsp;that cannot be easily replicated.</li>
<li>lt is possible to exchange goods by a direct swap. But,&nbsp;barter, as direct exchange is usually termed, is comparatively&nbsp;rare in the modern world. In today's world where&nbsp;there is a high degree of specialization, exchanges must&nbsp;take place quickly and smoothly. Hence, we have an&nbsp;instrument called money a common denominator for all&nbsp;goods and services. Since money provides a convenient&nbsp;way of exchanging goods, therefore, it allows society to&nbsp;gain the advantages of specialization and hence society&nbsp;escapes the complications of barter.<br>However people use money as a medium of exchange&nbsp;only when they are confident that it will be exchangeable&nbsp;for real goods and services, and resources when&nbsp;they spend it. A high rate of inflation persisting over a&nbsp;longer period of time erodes the value of money far too&nbsp;quickly and far too much, therefore people may switch&nbsp;to barter or else they may use other commodities as&nbsp;money in order to retain their purchasing power.<br>Money also serves as a measure of value and a unit of&nbsp;account. Society uses money as a scale to measure the&nbsp;relative worth of a wide variety of commodities, making&nbsp;possible the operation of a price system and automatically&nbsp;providing the basis for keeping accounts, calculating&nbsp;profit and loss, costing, etc. An economy can effectively&nbsp;employ money as a unit of account only when&nbsp;its purchasing power is relatively stable. A measure of&nbsp;value, which is subject to drastic shrinkage, does not&nbsp;permit buyers and sellers to establish the terms of trade&nbsp;clearly. When, for instance, the value of a unit of money&nbsp;is declining rapidly, sellers will not know what to charge,&nbsp;and buyers will not know what to pay, for goods and&nbsp;services. So the unit of account function is affected&nbsp;because it becomes more difficult to compare values&nbsp;between commodities and over time.<br>Money serves as a store of wealth, the most convenient&nbsp;way of keeping any income which is surplus to immediate&nbsp;requirements. More than that, because money is&nbsp;also the medium of exchange, wealth stored in this form&nbsp;is completely liquid: it can be converted into other goods&nbsp;immediately and without cost. The effect of high rate&nbsp;of inflation on the store of value function is to reduce&nbsp;the value of people's savings. This is particularly true&nbsp;when the real interest rate becomes negative. In such&nbsp;situations people start searching for substitute methods&nbsp;of preserving the value of their assets, such as purchasing&nbsp;gold, property or even works of art.<br>As a standard of deferred payments, money assumes&nbsp;the role of a unit in which, given stability in its value,&nbsp;loans are made and future contracts fixed. Without money,&nbsp;there would be no common basis to allow for dealing in&nbsp;debts - the work of such institutions as insurance&nbsp;companies, banks and discount-houses. By providing a&nbsp;standard for repayment, money makes borrowing and&nbsp;lending much easier. High rate of inflation also affects&nbsp;this function. Businesses, for instance, may be unwilling&nbsp;to become creditors over a long period of time when&nbsp;they fear a decline in the value of money. Borrowers&nbsp;however will be more willing to borrow because their&nbsp;debt in real terms will decline.<br>It, therefore, follows that a high rate of inflation is more&nbsp;likely to affect all its functions adversely. Money as a&nbsp;medium of exchange, however, is affected a great deal&nbsp;but that too depends on the time period over which a&nbsp;high rate of inflation persists.</li>

In addition to these governments also aim at achieving high degree of efficiency in the use of nation's scarce resources and a fairly acceptable level of distribution of income and wealth. Though not all governments will share these objectives, yet it is also true that there will be tradeoffs and potential conflicts between the objectives, and different governments will attach differing priorities to them. The following are the traditional macroeconomic aims of governments.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low unemployment<br></strong>It is important to keep unemployment levels as low as possible. High unemployment is expensive for the government and, therefore, for the taxpayer. For every unemployed person, there are two costs to the government. First, the unemployed workers will be entitled to benefit. Secondly, there is the less obvious cost of the loss of tax revenues, both from direct and indirect taxes, which the workers would have paid in work. Then there is the cost to the whole economy as unemployment involves a loss of potential output and hence lower living standard in general. Young unemployed workers may inflict other external costs on the society, crime for example.</li>
<li><strong>Price stability</strong><br>Control of inflation is important because if inflation gets out of control, the economy stops growing. The authorities are forced to raise interest rates to counter inflation. At higher interest rate consumers stop borrowing to spend and firms also reduce borrowing to invest. Exports become less competitive and the economy may well drop into a recession.</li>
<li><strong>High but sustainable economic growth</strong> <br>Economic growth is a measure of rate of change of real GDP over a period of time. High rate of growth can be achieved by bringing unemployed resources at work or alternatively, by improving productivity of existing resources. Governments seek to achieve high but sustainable growth rate mainly because it leads to improved living standards and economic stability.</li>
<li><strong>Balance of payments in equilibrium</strong> <br>BOP is a summary of all economic transactions of a country with other nations over one year time period. A persistent BOP deficit initially results in a decline of a nation's foreign currency reserves and a run on its exchange rate. Ultimately, it necessitates borrowing and the country accumulates foreign debts, which have to be repaid with interest in future. The ideal situation represents a position where, at least over a number of years, the nation spends and invests abroad no more than other nations spend or invest in it. <br><br>The proposed objectives in the question are classrooms with teachers, clinic with nurses, clean water and working toilets. All of these are significant for uplifting the quality of life in general in an economy. Empirical evidence suggests that most poor countries have not been able to invest sufficiently in their human capital, that is expenditure on health and education have been meager. Low levels of literacy, malnutrition, lack of proper medical care, and insufficient educational facilities all contribute to populations which are ill-equipped for industrialization and economic expansion. <br><br>Adequate sanitation, education and medical services yield widespread spillover benefits and government is the sole institution in a position to provide these services in required quantities. In short well educated and healthy labour force is the driving force behind rapid growth. <br><br>Governments do not necessarily have to abandon their traditional macro-economic aims in favour of the proposed aims in the question. In fact schools, medical services, clean water and adequate sanitation system is part of the infrastructure building programme and can be integrated with the traditional macro economic aims. For instance, the objectives of growth and employment can be achieved by making substantial spending on developing human capital by providing adequate educational and health infrastructure to the public. Such a programme will not only generate employment but will create a pool of literate and healthy labour force essential for sustained level of high economic growth. <br><br>However the objectives of growth and employment are potentially in conflict with the other two macro economic objectives of low inflation and a favourable balance of payment. Too much spending even on building human capital and physical infrastructure can prove to be inflationary at least in the short run. The economy might also have strain on the balance of payment as its imports are likely to rise. <br><br>In theory, at least the choice depends on the current state of the economy. For example, in times of economic recession governments must try and achieve the proposed aims in conjunction with highest possible growth and lowest unemployment but with maintaining low rate of inflation and sacrificing minimum on balance of payments. <br><br>ln conclusion, the order of priority that these objectives are given depends on the current economic situation and the government in office. But all governments in all nations ultimately desire these same objectives in their quest for the welfare of people and economic stability.</li>

<li>Price elasticity of demand (PED) is a numerical measure&nbsp;of the sensitivity of quantity demanded of a product&nbsp;following a change in its price. Economists use the&nbsp;following in order to measure the coefficient of PED.<br><br>PED = (% change in the quantity demanded of product)/(% change in the price product B)<br><br>Thus PED coefficient tells us what the proportionate&nbsp;change in the quantity demanded for a good is following&nbsp;a given change in the price of the same good. These %&nbsp;changes are calculated by dividing the change in price of&nbsp;the good by the original price and the change in quantity&nbsp;demanded of the good by the original quantity demanded.<br><br>The coefficient of PED is usually negative because the&nbsp;theory of demand states that quantity demanded is&nbsp;inversely related to the price, ceteris paribus. However,&nbsp;it is normally the convention to ignore the negative sign&nbsp;and concentrate on the value of the figure. So, demand&nbsp;is said to be price elastic (PED &gt; 1) when a given&nbsp;change in price results in a proportionately larger change&nbsp;in quantity demanded while it is price inelastic&nbsp;(PED &lt; 1) when a given change in price leads to a&nbsp;proportionately smaller change in quantity demanded.&nbsp;In case of unitary elastic demand (PED = 1) both price&nbsp;and quantity demanded change by the same proportion.<br><br>PED is important in relation to its effect on businesses'&nbsp;total revenue (TR). Total revenue is the amount that a&nbsp;firm earns from the sale of a product and is calculated&nbsp;by multiplying per unit price of a product with the total&nbsp;quantity sold (TR = P x Q).<br><br>A business trying to increase its revenue by changing&nbsp;the price may use the concept of PED. Since it is given&nbsp;that the PED of white chocolate is greater than one i.e&nbsp;elastic, therefore a decrease in its price will have a&nbsp;positive impact on TR. Consider the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e5e5386ffce88db1e4758171effe7c84" alt="" width="267" height="205"><br><br>On the elastic range of demand curve the rectangular&nbsp;area labeled as fall in revenue is the result of decrease&nbsp;in price from P to P<sub>1</sub> while the area indicating a rise in&nbsp;revenue is generated by the resulting increase in the&nbsp;quantity demanded from q to q<sub>1</sub>. Since the larger&nbsp;proportionate change in quantity demanded outweighs&nbsp;the smaller proportionate fall in price, therefore, the&nbsp;policy of lowering price results in an increase in TR&nbsp;earned by the business. Note that the shaded area is&nbsp;common both before and after the price fall.<br><br>In case of dark chocolate the value of PED= (-)0.8. It&nbsp;suggests that the demand for dark chocolate is inelastic.&nbsp;Following graph shows how TR is likely to be affected&nbsp;by changes in price when the firm faces inelastic&nbsp;demand.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/49dff890772800ebc70706379364fdff" alt="" width="287" height="219"><br><br>On the inelastic range of demand curve an increase in&nbsp;price from P to P<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>reduces quantity demanded by a&nbsp;smaller proportion than the proportionate change in its&nbsp;price. Since the rise in price outweighs the resulting fall&nbsp;in quantity, therefore, it produces a bigger effect on the&nbsp;firm's TR.<br><br>It, therefore, follows that the producers of white chocolate&nbsp;can obtain a higher total revenue by lowering the&nbsp;price while producers of dark chocolate should increase&nbsp;the price of their product in order to have a positive&nbsp;effect on their total revenue.<br><br></li>
<li>The demand for chocolate can be defined as its quantities&nbsp;that the buyers are willing and able to purchase&nbsp;at various prices in a given period of time, ceteris paribus.&nbsp;Quantity demanded of chocolate is the function of&nbsp;its price and the two are inversely related provided&nbsp;everything else is constant. Figure (a) below shows a&nbsp;fall in quantity demanded of chocolate by an upward&nbsp;movement along its demand curve.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f91fa5b9a5fd2a95d2c76ce7cd251b6e" alt="" width="384" height="169"><br><br>The graph on the left indicates that a fall in quantity&nbsp;demanded of chocolate from q to q<sub>1</sub> is affected by a rise&nbsp;in its price from OP to OP<sub>1</sub>. This rise in price can be&nbsp;viewed as a result of a leftward shift in the supply&nbsp;curve, say due to a rise in costs of producing chocolate,&nbsp;a fall in productivity of labour or an increase in indirect&nbsp;tax. Whatever might have caused this the result is higher&nbsp;price and lower quantity demanded of chocolate. Under&nbsp;these conditions there might be a possibility that the&nbsp;firms regain the quantity demanded by adopting more&nbsp;efficient production techniques or through a better&nbsp;management of their cost of production. If, for instance,&nbsp;firms adopt improved methods of production which will&nbsp;improve the overall efficiency levels say by introducing&nbsp;better technology or superior training programs they can&nbsp;then manage to improve productivity of their workers.&nbsp;Productivity rise might offset increase in their cost of&nbsp;production and therefore firms can reduce their prices&nbsp;in order to increase quantity demanded. These measures&nbsp;however involve extra spending therefore they require a&nbsp;careful appraisal of costs and potential benefits.<br><br>Demand for chocolate, however, is influenced by the&nbsp;factors other than its own price and this is indicated by&nbsp;a shift in the demand curve as shown in figure (b). Just&nbsp;like all other normal goods a fall in demand for chocolate&nbsp;is also subject to a fall in general level of money&nbsp;incomes. We can use figure (b) in order to confirm the&nbsp;effect of decreasing incomes in terms of a leftward shift&nbsp;in the demand curve. It suggests that people are&nbsp;prepared to buy fewer chocolates at each and every&nbsp;price. The general fall in incomes is usually associated&nbsp;with the economy facing recession. If that be the case&nbsp;then the firms can introduce relatively low quality chocolates&nbsp;that they can sell at relatively more affordable prices&nbsp;or else they will have to wait for the tides to turn.<br><br>Apart from the levels of incomes a change in the demographic&nbsp;features of the country might cause a fall in&nbsp;demand for chocolates. When, for instance, the proportion&nbsp;of aging population rises and those of young falls&nbsp;then overall consumption of chocolate might decrease.&nbsp;The firms in that case can introduce new brands to their&nbsp;product lines, "sugar free", for example, targeting people&nbsp;with diabetes who have a taste for chocolates but&nbsp;cannot consume regular bars due to health reasons. If&nbsp;firms find that people have a taste for chocolates but&nbsp;they have started to consume less of it because they&nbsp;have become more weight conscious then they can introduce&nbsp;lighter brands which they can advertise highlighting&nbsp;the health benefits of consuming more chocolates&nbsp;with the least impact on their weight compared to&nbsp;other substitutes.<br>If, however, firms find that a fall in demand is either due&nbsp;to a change in people's taste or their preferences then&nbsp;an effective advertisement targeting those people can&nbsp;win them back.<br><br>So, a fall in demand for chocolates can be attributed to&nbsp;a number of factors. The ability of the firms to reverse&nbsp;this trend however depends on the particular cause. A&nbsp;fall in incomes, or a fall in number of consumers due to&nbsp;the change in age composition of population or a fall in&nbsp;consumption due to medical reasons are difficult to deal&nbsp;with. Other reasons such as rising costs and changes in&nbsp;taste or preferences can be addressed through improvement&nbsp;in efficiency levels and effective advertisement.&nbsp;The choice of measures, however, depends on their&nbsp;relative costs and potential benefits.</li>

Some of them relate to the general level of economic activity. Others are the result of a failure of the labour market in an economy to work optimally.</p>
<p>Unemployment resulting due to a lack of aggregate demand for goods and services is called cyclical or involuntary unemployment. This is also known as Keynesian "demand deficient" unemployment and is associated with the transition of the economy through the business cycle. When there is an economic recession we expect to see a rising level of unemployment because of plant closures and worker lay-offs. This is due to a fall in AD demand leading to a contraction in output across many industries as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/d55e9643d3417e33ec268b88479e2411" alt="" width="272" height="186"></p>
<p>A fall in aggregate demand from AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub> results in a reduction of national income from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub> and as such there is an increase in the numbers employed. <br>Although demand deficient unemployment is usually associated with economic recessions it can also exist in the long run when the economy is constantly run below capacity. As the economy recovers from a downturn, we expect to see the problem of cyclical unemployment decline.</p>
<p>Unemployment resulting from a disequilibrium in the labour market is another form of involuntary unemployment. This is also known as real wage unemployment and is often referred to as classical unemployment. Classical real wage unemployment is a form of disequilibrium unemployment that occurs when real wages for jobs are forced above the market clearing level.</p>
<p>Traditionally, trade unions are seen as the institutions causing this type of unemployment. Some economists believe that the introduction of the national minimum wage (NMW) may create some classical unemployment in industries where average wage rates are closer to the NMW level and where international competition from low-labour cost producers is severe.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/50935302f6742507fbc5722511812352" alt="" width="353" height="209"></p>
<p>If a real wage (W<sub>2</sub>) is maintained above the equilibrium real wage (W<sub>e</sub>) then the result is an excess supply of labour equal to q<sub>1</sub> - q<sub>2</sub>. This is labeled as real wage unemployment.</p>
<p>The natural rate of unemployment is the equilibrium rate of unemployment and also called voluntary unemployment. It consists of frictional and structural unemployment.</p>
<p>Frictional unemployment is voluntary or transitional unemployment due to people moving between jobs: For example, newly redundant workers, or workers entering the labour market for the first time such as graduates and school-leavers take time to find jobs at wage rates they are prepared to accept. Many of the frictionally unemployed are out of work for a short time whilst engaged in job search.</p>
<p>Imperfect information in the labour market may lead to a rise in frictional unemployment if the jobless are unaware of the available jobs. Often this information failure is localised - for few workers scan the vacancies available across the whole economy, they tend to restrict their search for work to a local area. Besides some people may opt not to accept jobs at prevailing market wage rates if they believe the income tax and benefit system will reduce the net increase in income people can expect from taking paid work. This problem is referred to as the unemployment trap.</p>
<p>Unemployment caused by a change in the pattern of demand and methods of production is called structural unemployment. Structural change is a constant feature of a flexible economy. Hence unemployment occurs when people are made jobless because of 'capital-labour substitution' which reduces the demand for labour in an industry, or when there is a long run decline in demand which causes redundancies and worker lay-offs. In short the cause of structural unemployment is a mismatch between the existing skills of the workers and the skills required for the new job opportunities.</p>
<p>In some industries such as fruit-picking and holiday catering unemployment is seasonal in character. The difficulty is that the skills required by different seasonal jobs are not substitutable but demand for their products follows a seasonal pattern.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 153</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8973</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Indonesian Economy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Extract 1: Indonesian rupiah weakens to lowest level in almost four years.<br></strong>In 2012, the Indonesian rupiah's value against the United States (US) dollar fell to its lowest level since&nbsp;September 2009. This caused the cost of oil imports to rise, which resulted in a deficit on lndonesia's current&nbsp;account for the first time since 1997. However, recent developments might support the rupiah. In June, the&nbsp;2013 Budget reduced fuel subsidies, which caused a price rise for fuel of 44%. Although this will put upward&nbsp;pressure on inflation, it is hoped that the reduction in fuel subsidies will have a positive impact on the&nbsp;Government Budget. Also, in June, Indonesia's Central Bank raised interest rates, which should take some&nbsp;pressure off the rupiah.<strong><br></strong></p>

Nickel&nbsp;prices increased as markets prepared themselves. for a fall in global supply. It is hoped that the ban would&nbsp;mean that multinational companies would be forced to invest in factories in Indonesia so that the nickel is&nbsp;processed in Indonesia rather than just being mined and exported. This would create jobs in Indonesia and&nbsp;broaden Indonesia's manufacturing base.<strong><br></strong></p>

Inflation&nbsp;in Indonesia was stable at 8.4% in December 2013, but economic growth slowed to its lowest rate in four&nbsp;years.

<li>During the course of three years, Rupiah first appreciated from July 2009 to July 2011 then it depreciated from&nbsp;July 2011 until July 2013. Over all it has appreciated between July 2009 and July 2013.</li>
<li>A fall in the value of rupiah against the US$ must have reduced the dollar price of Indonesian exports. At the&nbsp;same time it would have increased their import price in rupiah. However, due to the inelastic nature of demand&nbsp;for exports and imports in the short run these changes might have decreased Indonesian export receipts and&nbsp;increased import bill leading to a deficit in their current account.</li>
<li>An introduction of a subsidy lowers the cost of a product and therefore causes its supply to increase. A cut&nbsp;in subsidy on fuel, therefore, would have increased the cost of fuel and hence it would have shifted its supply&nbsp;curve to the left as indicated in the figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/955a6085436cff8559a98abc81f68103" alt="" width="272" height="238"><br><br>Market price with full subsidy is OP. A 44% cut in subsidy would have caused its supply curve to shift to&nbsp;the left. This would have caused price to rise from OP to OP<sub>1</sub>. Since the demand for fuel is expected to be&nbsp;inelastic, therefore, most of the cut in subsidy would have been passed on to the consumers by increasing its&nbsp;price.</li>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Followed by a rise in interest rate, an overall decrease in consumption in the US could result in a fall in&nbsp;Indonesian exports to the US. This in turn could reduce their receipts from exports and therefore it can&nbsp;have an adverse effect on balance of payment.</li>
<li>A relatively higher interest rate in the US would result in an increase in capital flows from Indonesia to&nbsp;the US. It would, therefore, affect demand and supply of Indonesian rupiah in the foreign exchange market.&nbsp;The likely effect is illustrated on the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c37c259de051ac6ad71294408a180910" alt="" width="313" height="234"><br><br>In pursuit of better return, a higher amount of capital outflow from Indonesia to the US would increase&nbsp;the demand for dollars. At the same time it would increase the supply of rupiah as indicated by a rightward&nbsp;shift in its supply curve. However, a fall in capital inflow resulting from the relatively lower return&nbsp;being offered by Indonesia would lead to a fall in the demand for rupiah. The effect of these changes can&nbsp;be marked as depreciation of rupiah against the US$.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A fall in the value of the rupiah would reduce the price of Indonesia's exports and increase the price of&nbsp;Indonesia's imports. This might lead to an increase in net exports and hence a rise in aggregate demand. The&nbsp;effects on output and price level can be observed on the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/331101adb435bcbb78466bffa107ac59" alt="" width="395" height="258"><br><br>Since AD = C + I + G + X - M, therefore an increase in net exports (x - m) would increase AD as indicated&nbsp;by a rightward shift. This could lead to a rise in output and/or prices. The effects, however, depend on the&nbsp;slope of AS that indicates the availability of spare resources. The flatter slope of AS suggests higher availability&nbsp;of spare resources. Thus under this situation when AD rises it would bring those spare resources at work and&nbsp;therefore would lead to a relatively larger increase in output than the change in price level. Otherwise if AS&nbsp;is more steep it would bring a proportionately smaller increase in output as compared to the price level.<br>Secondly a reduction in fuel subsidy would increase the cost of fuel and therefore would increase industry's&nbsp;costs of supplying it. This would lead to a fall in aggregate supply and a fall in output together with a rise&nbsp;in prices. The magnitude of changes in output and price level, however, depends on the slope of AD. The steeper&nbsp;the AD the higher is the resulting increase in price level and therefore the lower is the fall in output.</li>

<li>A perfectly competitive market is characterized by large number of firms, complete freedom of entry and exit, product homogeneity and perfect knowledge of the good and its market by both producers and consumers. No individual firm has any influence on the market price. Firms are described as being price takers. The ruling price is determined by the forces of market demand and supply. Facing the market price each individual firm can choose any quantity it likes and can sell at the ruling price without affecting the sales of rival firms. In the short run there is no time for new firms to enter the market and thus supernormal profits can persist. In the long run, however, any supernormal profits will be competed away by the entry of new firms. <br><br>In imperfect markets such as monopolistic competition and oligopoly firms have some influence on the market price and are therefore price makers. In monopolistic competition each firm is competing with a large number of similar producers. In this situation the demand curve facing the individual firm will be downward sloping but relatively price elastic because of the presence of substitutes. At the heart of this model of competition is the fact that there are a large number of competitors using a combination of price and non-price competition to try and increase their market power. Oligopoly is defined as a market situation where the total output is concentrated in the hands of a few firms. The product may or may not be differentiated. What matters is that some or all the firms earn substantial profits over the long run because barriers to entry make it difficult or impossible for new firms to enter the market. <br><br>Unlike perfectly competitive market where a large number of firms sell homogeneous product air craft manufacturing industry comprises of only a handful of large firms and each one of them is producing highly differentiated aircrafts with distinct features. Technological breakthroughs, as a result of extensive research, have enabled these few manufacturers to gain from economies of scale and to grow large enough to influence the market. Hence each one of them is expected to enjoy substantial market share to exert influence over the price they charge, a central feature of imperfect market. Moreover, high capital cost and huge research and development expenditure prevent other firms from entering the industry. Thus the firms are likely to earn substantial profit over the long run which is contrary to the possibility of only normal profit in a perfectly competitive market. Hence, it can be concluded that airbus is operating in an imperfectly competitive market.</li>
<li>Public interest is said to be best served when markets operate under perfect competition. This is because the consumer gains from low prices, as not only are costs kept low, but also there are no long run supernormal profits to add to cost. Because of this perfect competition is said to lead to consumer sovereignty. Consumers, through the market, determine what and how much is to be produced. Firms have no power to manipulate the market. They cannot control price. The only thing they can do to increase profit is to become more efficient, and that benefits the consumer too, rt is often argued that imperfectly competitive markets lead to the loss of consumer sovereignty and thus results in a less efficient allocation of resources than perfect competition. Figure below compares the longrun equilibrium positions for two firms. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a6bc6b0f94f54391e695d194d401d2f5" alt="" width="380" height="258"><br><br>One firm is under perfect competition and thus faces a horizontal demand curve. It will produce an output of Q<sub>1</sub> at a price of P<sub>1</sub>. The other is under imperfect competition and thus faces a downward-sloping demand curve. It will produce the lower output of Q<sub>2</sub> at the higher price of P<sub>2</sub>. A crucial assumption here (s that a firm would have the same long-run average cost (LRAC) curve in both cases. Given this assumption, imperfect competition has the following disadvantages: <br>•&nbsp; Less will be sold and at a higher price.<br>•&nbsp; Firms will not be producing at the least-cost point.<br><br>By producing more, firms would move to a lower point on their LRAC curve. Thus firms under imperfect competition are said to have excess capacity. In Figure above this excess capacity is shown as Q<sub>1</sub> - Q<sub>2</sub>. In the long run firm in imperfect market will produce at an output below its minimum-cost point and charge a price higher than its MC. In other words, in imperfect competition neither productive nor allocative efficiency occurs in the long run equilibrium.&nbsp;<br><br>The firms in imperfect market are also said to be involved in wasteful competition that uses scarce resources which could be put to alternative uses in producing more goods. Expenditure on practices such as promotion and advertisement tend to raise the price paid by the consumers. Also if firms in imperfect market act collusively and jointly maximize profits, they will in effect be acting together as a monopoly. In such cases the disadvantages to society experienced under monopoly will also be experienced under imperfect market. <br><br>On the other hand it is often argued that firm will not be operating at the bottom of its LRAC curve, but the nature of the industry may allow some economies of scale to be gained. The LRAC curve would thus be lower than in the case of the larger number of smaller firms that would be necessary if the industry were to be perfectly competitive. The size of the economies of scale, if any, will obviously vary from industry to industry. Furthermore, the consumer may benefit from monopolistic competition by having a greater variety of products to choose from. Each firm may satisfy some particular reauirement of particular consumers. <br><br>The question is if imperfect compention brings the disadvantage of excess capacity but the advantage of diversity is the consumer necessarily worse off? The answer depends on the will and choice of the society at large. <br><br>Innovation is the central feature of imperfect markets. Aware that new products and processes by rival firms can threaten their survival, existing firms must have a powerful incentive to engage continuously in R＆D. Innovative new products often enable these firms to maintain or increase their profit. Thus innovation can strengthen their existing market power. The underlying objective of air bus of increasing its research budget up to approximately $600 millions in order develop environmentally friendly aircraft that had lower fuel consumption is to maximize profit. They must have a large economic profit from which they can fund the expensive research and development. Moreover the existence of barriers might have given them some assurance that it will reap the reward of successful R＆D. Thus short run inefficiencies might be partly or wholly offset by air bus contribution to better products, lower prices and lower cost over time. <br><br>The best outcome of their action is that they will be able to create a socially friendly image while achieving their goal of profit maximization. Thus action by airbus does not prove the text book wrong because the assumptions of profit maximization and abnormal profit in such a market structure hold true.</li>

However. social and political factors also play a part in wage determination, as labour is a unique factor, being the human factor.</p>
<p>The main factor which determines the level of wages in a particular occupation is the interaction of demand for labour and supply of labour involved in that occupation. If demand is high for a category of labour then it is likely that wages will rise and vice versa. If supply of a certain category of labour is limited then, again, it is likely that wages will rise and vice versa. If labour was a homogeneous factor and was sold in a perfectly competitive labour markets, every person would earn the income in equilibrium. Disequilibrium differentials in wages would arise, but workers move from lower income to higher income jobs until the differentials had disappeared.</p>
<p>In the real world however, some workers scrape out a bare living, others earn modest but adequate incomes while yet others earn enough to afford many of life's luxuries.</p>
<p>If a unit of labour produces a certain physical amount of a good which sells at a particular price (marginal revenue product) then the employer cannot afford to pay the worker a wage greater than the MRP. The MRP ( which is a derived demand) is obtained from the product of MPP of labour and price of the product. Hence an improvement in the productivity of labour would increase the demand for labour; likewise, an increase in the price of the product will increase the demand for labour. Thus the demand for labour is greatly affected by the value of its MRP. The higher the MRP of labour then the greater the demand for labour and the higher will be wages going to labour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If demand for a particular type of labour is inelastic then the likelihood is that labour will receive higher wages. Demand for labour will be inelastic when other factors cannot easily be substituted for it, when the demand for the good it produces is inelastic and if labour forms only a small percentage of the entrepreneur's total costs. If labour has a high MRP and demand for its services is inelastic then the probability is that wages for that labour will be high. Thus labour in expanding industries will probably earn more than labour in declining industries because they will have a high MRP and demand for their services will be inelastic. Moreover skilled workers, compared to unskilled workers, will also have a high MRP and inelastic demand so again their wages will tend to be higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The supply of labour to an industry is said to be determined by the principle of net advantages. Labour will try to move from an industry of lower net advantage to an industry of higher net advantage. The supply of labour in a particular occupation depends on the skills and ability required, qualifications and training required, the ability of trade unions, and professional bodies to restrict entry into an occupation.</p>
<p>Some income differentials arise because basic human characteristics cause the supply of some types of labour to remain low relative to the demand for it, even in the long run. For instance, pop stars or footballers where relatively rare ability is required. Similarly if a job requires specific qualifications training then supply of labour will be reduced and wages higher. For instance, barristers and doctors need good qualifications and a long period training which limits the number of people who are able to do these job. Investment in such training is usually costly, and the return is usually in terms of higher labour productivity and hence higher earning power.</p>
<p>The strength of a trade union to achieve higher wages will also be a considerable factor determining the level of wages to a particular occupation. If trade unions and professional bodies can limit entry into certain occupations by apprenticeships and the need to pass exams then supply will be limited and wage higher. Thus industries with a strong trade union are likely to pay more than those with a weak trade union.</p>
<p>Likewise some forms of discrimination makes it difficult or impossible, for certain groups to take certain jobs, even if they are equipped by skill and education for these jobs. Until very recently, non-whites and women found many occupations closed to them. Even today when overt discrimination in hiring is illegal, many feel that more subtle forms of discrimination are applied.</p>
<p>To isolate the effects of discrimination, we begin by considering a non-discriminating labour market and then introduce discrimination between two groups of equally qualified workers called group X and group Y. The analysis, however, applies generally to situations in which workers are distinguished on grounds other than their ability, such as female and male, black and white, alien and citizen, Catholic and Protestant. Suppose that, except for the fact that half of the people are marked with X and the other half are marked with Y, the groups are the same; each has the same number of members, the same proportion who are educated to various levels, identical distribution of talent, and so on. Suppose that there are two occupations. Occupation E (for elite) requires people of above average education and skill, and occupation O (ordinary) can use anyone.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6b6314f575decc95161ade66e4e763cf" alt="" width="397" height="214"></p>
<p>Sometimes the supply of labour to a particular occupation may be limited because the job is dangerous or dirty. Such occupations may command higher wages, as for miners. Other jobs, such as teaching or the civil service, have pleasant working conditions, job security and good pension schemes. Consequently such jobs may earn lower wages. Similarly some jobs may have a great many perks and fringe benefits and the money wages may be lower because of these advantage. <br>If the area has a large pool of unemployed people because of declining industries then the supply of labour to many occupations may be high and may make for lower wages in comparison to similar occupations in other parts of the country. Thus the more limited the supply of labour to a particular industry the greater likelihood of higher wages.</p>
<p>Many wage inequalities result from several types of market imperfections which impede workers from moving from their current jobs to take higher-paying jobs. For instance workers may simply not be aware of job opportunities and wage rates in other geographic areas and in other jobs for which they qualify. Consequently, the flow of qualified labor from lower-paying to higher-paying jobs - and thus the adjustments in labor supply - may not be sufficient to equalize wages within occupations. Also many workers are reluctant to move to new places, to leave friends, relatives, and associates, to force their children to change schools, to sell their houses, and to incur the costs and inconveniences of adjusting to a new job and a new community. The reluctance or inability of workers to move enables geographic wage differentials within the same occupations to persist.</p>
<p>It can thus be seen that wage inequalities are caused by demand and supply of labour, strength of unions, various market imperfections and non-monetary differences.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 156</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8970</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In many cities worldwide, newspaper publishers compete with each other.

<p>Discuss how a firm might compete in a market.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Firms in different industries can compete on price or non-price factors. Price competition involves offering a lower price in order to boost sales. Non-price competition entails product differentiation, and advertisement. Product differentiation is a strategy in which one firm's product is distinguished from competing products by means of its design, packaging, related services, quality, location or other attributes. Advertising involves a seller communicating message about his product to potential buyers.</p>
<p>For a firm the scope of competition on price or non-price factors is governed by the structure of the industry. In economic theory, a range of models has been developed in order to explain different ways of competition. We start our analysis by considering a perfectly competitive market where each firm is assumed to be price taker and is unable to influence the market price. Product homogeneity and complete freedom of entry and exit are the essential features of perfectly competitive market. Facing the market price each individual firm can choose any quantity it likes and can sell at the ruling price without affecting the sales of rival firms. Hence there is no scope of price competition for individual firms. Similarly there is no scope of non-price competition, since all firms produce homogeneous product. The firms' behaviour is strictly limited in a perfectly competitive market and the only way to compete would be to increase productivity and lower average total cost.</p>
<p>In imperfect markets such as monopolistic competition and oligopoly firms have some influence on the market price and are therefore price makers. In monopolistic competition each firm is competing with a large number of similar producers. In this situation the demand curve facing the individual firm will be downward sloping but relatively price elastic because of the presence of substitutes. At the heart of this model of competition is the fact that there are a large number of competitors using a combination of price and non-price competition to try and increase their market power. It might be an option for firms to reduce their price in order to increase total revenue. But the prediction is that the firms will only be able to earn normal profit in the long run due to the free entry of rivals.</p>
<p>The clue to the behaviour of firms in this market structure lies in the concept of product differentiation. This highlights the important role that advertisement and promotions play in this market structure. Successful advertising will not only shift the firm's demand curve to the right at the expense of the rivals but will also reduce the price elasticity if the consumers feel there are no close substitutes.</p>
<p>Oligopoly is defined as a market situation where the total output is concentrated in the hands of a few firms. An effective oligopoly can exist if a handful of firms dominate the market. Although they each have market power in the form of influence over the price they charge, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of competitive tactics means that firms may prefer non-price competition. The difficulty of choosing competitive strategies and of predicting the response of rivals may change the behaviour of firms. There are situations where big firms find that it is in their interest to co-operate with rivals. They can form collusion which is an anti competitive action by producers. Informal or tacit collusion usually takes the form of price leadership, where firms automatically follow the lead of one of the group.</p>
<p>An oligopolist would only start a price war if its cost of production were significantly lower than its rivals. Where the firm is highly diversified, a firm may be prepared to sacrifice profits by cutting the price in an attempt to increase market share.</p>
<p>Finally a monopoly is where a single firm controls the entire output of the industry. A monopoly is protected from competition by the entry barriers. So there is no actual competition and no scope of competitive behaviour. But the monopolist might involve in non-price competition as a means of deterring potential competitors. The monopolist's profits could be increased in certain circumstances by a practice known as price discrimination. Price discrimination occurs where the monopolist chooses to split the output up and sell it at different prices to different consumers. The monopolist's aim is to charge what the consumers will pay and turn the consumer surplus into producer surplus in the form of abnormal profit.</p>
<p>Hence the competitive behaviour of firms is subject to the prevailing market conditions.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 157</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8969</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether inflation is more likely to be caused by&nbsp;a shift in an economy's aggregate demand or a shift in&nbsp;its aggregate supply.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general&nbsp;price level leading to a fall in the purchasing power or&nbsp;value of money. The rate of inflation is measured by the&nbsp;annual percentage change in the level of consumer prices.</p>
<p>Economists make a simple distinction between demand&nbsp;pull and cost push inflation.</p>
<p>Demand pull inflation is largely the result of the level&nbsp;of AD being allowed to grow too fast compared to what&nbsp;the supply-side capacity can meet. The result is excess&nbsp;demand for goods and services and pressure on businesses&nbsp;to raise prices in order to increase their profit&nbsp;margins. So, if aggregate demand rises firms will respond&nbsp;to a rise in demand partly by raising prices and partly&nbsp;by increasing output. Just how much they raise prices&nbsp;depends on how much their costs rise as a result of&nbsp;increasing output. In other words, it will depend on the&nbsp;shape of the AS curve. The effect is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/4b0b38069cb6da7c16ca11061db10ecd" alt="" width="325" height="243"></p>
<p>The rise in aggregate demand is illustrated by a rightward&nbsp;shift in the aggregate demand curve, from AD<sub>1</sub> to&nbsp;AD<sub>2</sub>. Prices rise from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, and output rises from&nbsp;Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub>. The steeper the aggregate supply curve, the&nbsp;more prices will rise and the less output will increase.</p>
<p>The aggregate supply curve will tend to become steeper&nbsp;as the economy approaches the peak of the business&nbsp;cycle. Thus it follows that the closer the actual output&nbsp;gets to potential output, and the less slack there is in&nbsp;the economy, the more will firms respond to a rise in&nbsp;demand by raising their prices.</p>
<p>These rises in aggregate demand may be due to the&nbsp;changes in the behavior of consumers, businesses and&nbsp;government. For instance, increases in consumer demand,&nbsp;say due to expectations of higher prices in future, will&nbsp;increase AD and hence the price level. On the part of&nbsp;government a fiscal stimulus such as a cut in direct or&nbsp;indirect taxation or increasing government spending by&nbsp;borrowing from banking system feed through directly&nbsp;into extra demand in the circular flow.</p>
<p>Also a monetary stimulus by the authorities such as&nbsp;increasing money supply or lowering of interest rate&nbsp;stimulates consumer spending by households and&nbsp;investment spending by firms leading to an increase in&nbsp;AD and thus demand pull inflation. However if AD&nbsp;rises due to increased investment by businesses which&nbsp;increases capacity sufficiently to absorb all the extra&nbsp;demand, there will be no demand pull inflation.<br>Cost push inflation, on the contrary, is associated with&nbsp;leftward (upward) shift in the aggregate supply curve.&nbsp;Such shifts occur when costs of production rise independently&nbsp;of aggregate demand. If firms face a rise in&nbsp;costs, they will respond partly by raising prices and&nbsp;passing the costs to the consumer and partly by cutting&nbsp;back on production. This is shown by the graph&nbsp;below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f53d502a28dcdbfa7f1815565f08fd3d" alt="" width="330" height="255"></p>
<p>There is a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve:&nbsp;from AS<sub>1</sub>, to AS<sub>2</sub>. This causes the price level to rise to&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub> and the level of output to fall to Y<sub>2</sub>. Just how much firms raise prices and cut back on production depends&nbsp;on the shape of the aggregate demand curve. The less&nbsp;elastic the AD curve, the less will sales fall as a result&nbsp;of any price rise, and hence the more will firms be able&nbsp;to pass on the rise in their costs to consumers as higher&nbsp;prices.</p>
<p>Again this rise in costs could be caused by the changes&nbsp;in the behavior of firms and government. As a result we&nbsp;can distinguish between various types of supply shocks&nbsp;and hence cost push inflation:</p>
<p>Firstly, inflation caused by the producers called profit-push&nbsp;inflation. This is where firms use their monopoly&nbsp;power to make bigger profits by pushing up prices independently&nbsp;of consumer demand. For example the&nbsp;decisions of the major utility companies providing electricity,&nbsp;gas or water on their prices for the year ahead,&nbsp;or the price increase by the leading food retailers based&nbsp;on the strength of demand and competitive pressure in&nbsp;their markets.</p>
<p>Secondly, tax-push inflation. This is where increased&nbsp;taxation adds to the cost of living. For example, a rise&nbsp;in indirect tax rates such as VAT causes an increased&nbsp;domestic inflation because it increases a firm's production&nbsp;costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, import-push inflation. This is when the government&nbsp;devalues its currency or allows the foreign&nbsp;exchange to depreciate as part of its exchange rate policy.&nbsp;This causes prices of imported raw material and hence&nbsp;cost of production to increase leading to a cost push&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<p>Thus we conclude that the source of inflation in an&nbsp;economy could be a rise in AD resulting from a rise in&nbsp;consumer expenditure on goods and services, firms'&nbsp;investment expenditure, or government expenditure.&nbsp;However, it is likely that an increase in costs of production&nbsp;shifts AS to the left and, therefore, causes inflation.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 158</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8968</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In many cities worldwide, newspaper publishers compete with each other.

It measures the return to risk when committing scarce resources to a market or industry.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs take risks for which they require an adequate expected rate of return.</p>
<p>Total revenue is defined as total earnings of a firm from selling a certain level of output within a specified period: TR = P x Q. As for the costs there is a difference in the view point of accountants and economists. An accountant's view of a firm's costs is that they are incurred when the firm makes a recognised expenditure. They are production expenses paid out at a particular price and time. Thus accountants define profit as the revenue earned by a firm from which fixed and variable operating costs are deducted Economists disagree with this and argue that accountants' view of cost does not fully recognise the private cost of economic activity. The economist's view of costs includes money paid out to factors as well as an allowance for anything owned by the entrepreneur and used in the production process. This factor cost must be imputed or estimated and included with the other costs.</p>
<p>For economists the concept of opportunity cost is relevant. Opportunity cost involves the sacrifice of the closest alternative and is the value of what has been given up. For instance, entrepreneurs may have capital that could have been used at no risk elsewhere and would have earned an income or else the entrepreneur himself could have earned income working for someone else. Thus there will be a minimum level of profit that entrepreneur will expect, reflecting what his capital and labour would have earned elsewhere. This is the concept of normal profit. Because we treat normal profit as an opportunity cost of a business, we include an estimate for normal profit in the total cost. Thus profit, to an economist, is:</p>
<p>TR(unit price multiplied by number of units sold) minus TC (including normal profit). <br>Hence if the firm covers its TC (where TR meets TC or else ATC = AR) then it is making normal profits. Finally we can define normal profit as the minimum level of profit required to keep the factors of production in their current use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any profit less than normal profit (where price &lt; average total cost) is called sub-normal profit and any profit achieved in excess of normal profit (where price &gt; average total cost) is known as abnormal profit or supernormal profit. Different profit level are shown in the graphs below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/9aa6f1ecce1ff9b95f964e1a99a5aa6d" alt="" width="406" height="184"><br>In the graph in situation (a) a perfectly competitive firm produces an output q<sub>1</sub> where MC = MR. As explained above the cost curves incorporate an element of profit called normal profit. The TR is OP<sub>1</sub>Aq<sub>1</sub> and TC is OCBq<sub>1,&nbsp;</sub>hence the firm is making supernormal profit of P<sub>1</sub>ABC represented by the shaded area. When firms are making abnormal profits, there is an incentive for other producers to enter the market to try to acquire some of this profit. However, abnormal profit is only be a feature of perfect competition in the short run whereas abnormal profit persists in the long run in monopoly and imperfectly competitive markets such as oligopoly where firms can successfully block the entry of new firms.</p>
<p>In situation (b) the firm is profit maximizing, producing an output q<sub>2</sub>, and covering its total cost. The firm is breaking even, making normal profit. <br>Newspapers usually generate greater part of their revenue from advertisements they publish. However some part of revenue comes from the price that they charge from the buyers. For "free" newspapers it follows that they are distributed freely to the readers but the "free" newspaper is only free to the consumer. It is not free to the advertiser. The "free" newspaper could make a profit provided that revenues from selling advertising space at least covered costs of production and distribution. But the ability to charge for advertisement depends on its circulation and readership. The greater the circulation of the "free" newspaper, the more the newspaper could charge for advertisements and the higher the profit it earns.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 159</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8965</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>Private Sector Money and Development<br></strong></p>
<p>The amount of money that workers employed in foreign countries send home is worth US$200 billion a year and. therefore, the potential benefits of this to developing countries are huge.

For example, in Bangladesh and Kenya. recent figures were:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even small amounts of money sent by individuals can have an impact on development. The primary education of many children is paid for by money sent home by relatives working abroad. Some governments actively encourage workers to send money home. India has offered nonresident Indians special investment opportunities, perhaps influenced by the example of China where investment from Chinese living abroad has been a big factor in the development of the economy. The same story is true for Ghana and Nigeria, which are developing 'remittance partnerships' with the UK to make it easier and cheaper for people from· those countries working in the UK to send money home.</p>
<p>Further, the money could be worth even more if it is directed not just within the family but into community projects. In Mexico. local governments are matching any private money from abroad invested in community development with their own funds.</p>
<p>However, money is not the simple solution to poverty. The director of an economic research centre rejects the idea that income is the most significant contributor to well-being. Instead, in the research centre, attention is being turned to measures that seem to have little to do with economists' traditional indicators about production and consumption. When asked to rank what was important to them, poorer people said religion, relationships and inner peace were more important than income.</p>

<li>GDP is a measure of a nation's income generated within its own boundaries; hence GDP of Kenya would not include the incomes sent by Kenyans working in UK as these incomes were not earned in the home country.<br><br></li>
<li>Developing countries are usually characterized by low per capita income, shortage of physical and human capital, high population growth rate, poor health facilities coupled with high mortality rate, high unemployment or underemployment and dominating subsistence sector. <br><br>In a world of rising economic inequalities between countries, the motivation for workers in developing countries to move to search for better paid work in developed countries is extremely powerful. Just as capital can move from one country to another seeking the highest expected rate of return, so workers from developing countries are induced to move to developed countries for economic gains. Thus well paid employment opportunities in developed countries such as UK attract people from developing countries like Kenya where workers face low paid and yet limited job opportunities. Financial incentives are also affected by the generosity of welfare systems in developed countries and, in particular, the real income gains due to the low cost of living in developing countries as measured by purchasing power parity.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall people in developing countries expect that working in a developed country means better future prospects. More skilled training facilities and wide varieties of jobs would be available which they feel is nonexistent in their home country. Thus a disparity in socio-economic infrastructure is a strong incentive for the people of developing world to work in developed countries.<br><br></li>
<li>The government of Mexico had agreed to match private funds with their own funds in community development schemes is the sole reference made to the government action. On the other hand only clear reference made to private initiative is the Chinese example. In other countries the evidence consists of figures for Bangladesh and Kenya in one year only. Further references include Ghana and Nigeria developing remittance partnership with U.K. and special investment opportunities for non-resident Indians. However it is not clear that these actions are the result of private initiatives or the public sector. There are some references made in the article to individual cases involving education however to expand that to national level the information is insufficient. Besides there is no data provided on government expenditure and no comparative figures given between countries and on different economies over time. <br><br>Overall the information provided in the article is insufficient and one cannot fully endorse the view that economic development is largely the result of private actions rather than government policy.<br><br></li>
<li>Levels of production and consumption measured in terms of real (GDP is a traditional benchmark for interpreting changes in welfare of the people in a country over time. Real GDP is a monetary measure of output of all goods and services produced from all national resources at home minus the rate of inflation. <br><br>It is widely held that there should be a strong positive correlation between RGDP per capita and welfare; that is, greater production and consumption should move society toward "the good lite" and vice versa. Therefore, economists view levels and rates of growth of "real" per capita GDP as a useful indicator of well-being of the people. <br><br>The critics however, believe that the numbers cannot capture true overall well-being of a nation. For instance, in many cases an increase in RGDP per head may be the result of longer working hours, longer journeys to work payments for services necessitated by the stress of modern living e.g. anti-depressant drugs and higher social costs such as pollution. They point out that many aspects of welfare such as leisure happiness and health cannot be measured simply in terms of production and consumption. Further rising RGDP per head is usually accompanied by rising external cost such as pollution, noise and accidents. These are not officially measured within RGDP per head but they do affect welfare and distort comparison of well-being of a nation over time. <br><br>Also, there are some inherent problems with the measurement of GDP which make it less reliable indicator of society's well being in general. For instance, a rise in the proportion of black economy over the years may reduce RGDP per capita without causing a decline in production and consumption. Similarly, when reduction in RGDP per head is the result of a decrease in number of hours worked in accordance with the preferences of workers then people would have less to consume but more leisure time may increase their level of happiness. Similarly many qualitative changes could enhance welfare without necessarily achieving higher RGDP per head such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse.&nbsp;<br><br>Thus we must understand that real GDP per head is not a complete measure of economic welfare. Modern day economists use other alternative measures such as HDI and MEW. <br><br>The most well-known measure of welfare nowadays is The Human Development Index (HDI) The Human Development Index (HDI) is the average of three indicators<br><br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita on purchasing power (PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Educational attainment. as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight) <br><br>The closer the HDI is to I, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators. The advantage of using HDl is that it highlights the fact that people's welfare is influenced not only by the consumption of goods and services available to them but also by their ability to lead a long and healthy life and to acquire knowledge, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative factors. <br><br>The other measure that can be used for this purpose is known as measure of economic welfare (MEW). This starts with GNP and NNP. To this we add an allowance tor leisure and for various non-marketed goods and subtract various 'bads' or 'disamenities' such as pollution. <br><br>So it can be concluded that modern clay economists believe that a fair assessment of changes in welfare can be made by using a host of other variables in conjunction with any measure of production and consumption.&nbsp;</li>

<p>AD = C + I + G + X - M.</p>
<p>Consumption expenditure (C) includes expenditure on&nbsp;all goods and services produced and sold to their final&nbsp;users. It includes services, such as medical care and&nbsp;goods, such as fresh meat, vegetables cars, television&nbsp;sets etc. Investment (I) is defined as expenditure on the&nbsp;production of goods not for present consumption, but&nbsp;rather for their use in the future. Government expenditure&nbsp;(G) refers to the government providing goods and&nbsp;services that households want, such as health care and&nbsp;street lighting; it is obvious that they are adding to the&nbsp;sum total of valuable output in the same way as do&nbsp;private firms that produce. Net exports (X - M) are&nbsp;defined as total exports of goods and services minus&nbsp;total imports of goods and services.<br>A typical AD curve slopes downward from left to right&nbsp;against price level as shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/818c1eb9003b1b11656c98a32d8d56d8" alt="" width="209" height="180"></p>
<p>Other things equal, the lower the price level, the larger&nbsp;the real output the buyers will purchase. Conversely,&nbsp;the higher the price level, the smaller the real output&nbsp;they will buy. Thus the relationship between the price&nbsp;level and the amount of real output is inverse.</p>
<p>Interest rate is the price of money. A change in interest&nbsp;rate does have bearing on the components of AD, therefore,&nbsp;causes a shift in AD curve. A rise in interest rate,&nbsp;for instance, increases the opportunity cost of present&nbsp;consumption thus households tend to reduce their consumption&nbsp;and increase saving. Also, increase in interest&nbsp;rate discourages borrowing for durables such as cars and&nbsp;furniture etc. This is because effectively the prices of&nbsp;these goods rise. Similarly a rise in interest rate causes&nbsp;investment expenditure to fall because increase in the&nbsp;price of borrowing reduces net return that the firms expect&nbsp;to earn from their investment. Interest rate does not&nbsp;affect government expenditure because it is the part of&nbsp;government's budget. However, it affects net exports in&nbsp;the same way as it does to C and I. A rise in interest&nbsp;rate, for instance, results in an increase in capital inflow&nbsp;leading to a rise in the exchange rate. A higher exchange&nbsp;rate decreases the country's exports and increases its&nbsp;imports eventually resulting in a fall in net exports.</p>
<p>So a rise in interest rate causes consumer expenditure,&nbsp;investment expenditure and net exports to fall therefore&nbsp;results in a leftward shift (fall) in AD. Similarly a decrease&nbsp;in interest rate causes AD curve to shift rightward&nbsp;(rise).</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 161</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8960</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Income elasticity of demand (YED) is a numerical measure&nbsp;of the sensitivity of quantity demanded of a product&nbsp;to change in money income of the buyer. So, YED&nbsp;coefficient tells us what the % change in the quantity&nbsp;demanded for a good is following a given change in the&nbsp;income of the consumer. The following measure is used&nbsp;to calculate the coefficient of YED.<br><br>YED = (Percentage change in the quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in the income)<br><br>These % changes are calculated by dividing the change&nbsp;in income by the original income and the change in quantity&nbsp;demanded by the original quantity demanded.<br>With income elasticity of demand the sign attached the&nbsp;ratio is all important. A plus sign (+) signifies a so-called&nbsp;normal good whereas a minus sign (-) reveals the product&nbsp;to be an inferior good. For most goods the coefficient&nbsp;of YED is positive i.e. demand for a normal good&nbsp;always rises with income. Normal goods are further&nbsp;classified into:<br><strong><br></strong>Superior goods (luxury goods): for which income elasticity&nbsp;of demand is greater than unity<br>Basic goods: for which income elasticity of demand is&nbsp;less than 1<br><br>Although the quantity demanded of a normal good&nbsp;always rises with income, it rises more than proportionately&nbsp;for a superior good, for example, luxury cars.&nbsp;Conversely, demand for a basic good such as detergent&nbsp;rises at a slower rate than income.<br><br>Negative coefficient of income elasticity of demand&nbsp;indicates an inferior good. Consumers decrease the&nbsp;purchase of these goods, such as used clothes, as their&nbsp;incomes increase. In extreme cases, however, the coefficient&nbsp;of income elasticity of demand can be zero. This&nbsp;is when a change in income has no effect on the quantity&nbsp;demanded. This is the good that households consider a&nbsp;necessity and they may have reached their saturation&nbsp;level. Therefore, a change in income does not affect their&nbsp;demand any way.<br><br>Price elasticity of demand (PED), on the other hand, is&nbsp;a numerical measure of the sensitivity of quantity&nbsp;demanded of a product following a change in its price.&nbsp;Thus PED coefficient tells us what the proportionate&nbsp;change in the quantity demanded for a good is following&nbsp;a given change in the price of the same good. Economists&nbsp;use the following to measure coefficient of PED.<br><br>PED = (Percentage change in the quantity demanded of product)/(Percentage change in the price product B)<br><br>These % changes are calculated by dividing the change&nbsp;in price of the good by the original price and the change&nbsp;in quantity demanded of the good by the original quantity&nbsp;demanded. The coefficient of PED is usually negative&nbsp;because the theory of demand states that quantity&nbsp;demanded is inversely related to the price, ceteris paribus.&nbsp;Thus the negative sign is likely to be due to the&nbsp;negative slope of a normal demand curve.<br><br></li>
<li>As explained in part 'a' PED coefficient tells us the %&nbsp;change in the quantity demanded for a good following&nbsp;a given change in the price of that good. Negative&nbsp;coefficient of PED suggests the negative slope of a normal&nbsp;demand curve. However, it is normally the convention&nbsp;to ignore the negative sign and concentrate on the value&nbsp;of the figure.<br>Demand is said to be price elastic (PED&gt;1) when a&nbsp;given change in price results in a proportionately larger&nbsp;change in quantity demanded while it is price inelastic&nbsp;(PED &lt; 1) when a given change in price leads to a&nbsp;proportionately smaller change in quantity demanded.&nbsp;In case of unitary elastic demand (PED = 1) both price&nbsp;and quantity demanded change by the same proportion.<br><br>In extreme cases PED is either perfectly inelastic&nbsp;(PED= 0) where a price change results in no change in&nbsp;quantity demanded or perfectly elastic (PED = ∞) when&nbsp;a fraction increase in price results in quantity demanded&nbsp;to fall to zero. As a rule we can say that the higher the&nbsp;numerical value of PED, the greater the responsiveness&nbsp;of quantity demanded to change in price and vice versa.<br><br>PED is important in relation to its effect on businesses'&nbsp;total revenue (TR). Total revenue is the amount that is&nbsp;earned by a firm from the sale of a product and is&nbsp;calculated by multiplying per unit price of a product&nbsp;with the total quantity sold (TR = P x Q).<br><br>A business trying to increase its revenue by changmg&nbsp;the price of its product may carry out market research&nbsp;to identify the degree of PED. If the finding from research&nbsp;suggests that value of PED A<sub>1</sub> then a decrease in price&nbsp;will have a positive impact on TR. Consider the graph&nbsp;below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9eacee2e36203959a08e6db97a5f6855" alt="" width="286" height="213"><br><br>On the elastic range of demand curve the rectangular&nbsp;area labeled as fall in revenue is the result of decrease&nbsp;in price from P to P<sub>1</sub> while the area indicating a rise in&nbsp;revenue is generated by the resulting increase in the&nbsp;quantity demanded from q to q<sub>1</sub>. Since the larger proportionate&nbsp;change in quantity demanded outweighs the&nbsp;smaller proportionate fall in price, therefore, the policy&nbsp;of lowering price results in an increase in TR earned by&nbsp;the business. Note that the shaded area is common both&nbsp;before and after the price fall.<br><br>Following graph shows the situation when demand is&nbsp;inelastic.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7cf8d85aa0720d1e2c8a662c1980ac9d" alt="" width="284" height="211"><br><br>On the inelastic range of demand curve an increase in&nbsp;price from P to P<sub>1</sub> reduces quantity demanded by a&nbsp;smaller proportion than price. Thus the rise in price&nbsp;outweighs the resulting fall in quantity and it, therefore,&nbsp;generates a bigger effect on the firm's TR.<br><br>However, if PED = 1 then a change in price in either&nbsp;direction will maintain TR. This is because a given proportionate&nbsp;change in P is completely offset by the same&nbsp;proportionate change in quantity in the opposite direction.<br><br>So far as YED is concerned market research may determine&nbsp;if particular goods are generally considered normal&nbsp;or inferior. If YED is negative and incomes rise firms&nbsp;need to phase out inferior goods and should focus on&nbsp;producing more of normal goods. However in recession&nbsp;a decrease in incomes is likely to increase sales of inferior&nbsp;goods, therefore, businesses can increase TR by&nbsp;focusing more on producing those goods.<br><br>However, one should bear in mind that the data on PED&nbsp;and YED are not scientific knowledge. The data is based&nbsp;on survey studies on small samples of consumers. It&nbsp;cannot be completely accurate and at times may be misleading.&nbsp;Moreover the data is computed on assumption&nbsp;that other things do not change. In real markets other&nbsp;factors do change and data becomes obsolete.<br><br>So far as the significance of these measures for businesses&nbsp;is concerned price elasticity is more useful because&nbsp;prices are set by the business and therefore they&nbsp;can change them to good effect on revenues. But it also&nbsp;depends on the accuracy of data In case of YED changes&nbsp;in income are beyond the control of the business. All&nbsp;they can do is to choose the type of goods whose demand&nbsp;rises in varying economic conditions.</li>

<li>A market economy is usually associated with a pure&nbsp;capitalist system, where resources, such as land, raw&nbsp;material and capital, are privately owned. All economic&nbsp;decisions are taken by individual households and firms,&nbsp;which are assumed to act in their own self interest. Firms&nbsp;seek to maximize profits, consumers are motivated by&nbsp;the desire to maximize their utility and workers seek to&nbsp;maximize their wages.<br><br>The essence of pure free market system is price mechanism,&nbsp;often quoted as 'invisible hand', operating on its&nbsp;own with no intervention by government.<br><br>The price mechanism is a term used to describe the&nbsp;means by which the many millions of decisions taken&nbsp;each day by consumers and businesses to determine the&nbsp;allocation of scarce resources between competing uses.&nbsp;This apparently chaotic system of millions of separate&nbsp;transactions would not only allocate resources but it&nbsp;would allocate resources efficiently. It is not necessary&nbsp;that government or any other authority directs resources.&nbsp;The hidden hand of the market would do the job, and&nbsp;do it far better.<br><br>One of the three important functions of price mechanism&nbsp;is signaling through which resources are allocated.&nbsp;This means that market prices will adjust to demonstrate&nbsp;where resources are required, and where they are&nbsp;not. Prices rise and fall to reflect shortages and surpluses.<br>So, for example, assume that a successful lobbying from&nbsp;environmentalists changes consumers' preferences against&nbsp;leather products. In the market fewer leather products&nbsp;will be purchased. Consider the graph below to understand&nbsp;how scarce resources are reallocated through market&nbsp;system.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d88ee3ec99c210110a813bd3107e5ca5" alt="" width="234" height="200"><br><br>A change in the preferences of consumers results in a&nbsp;fall in demand from D to D<sub>1</sub> thus developing a surplus&nbsp;in the market. In the short run, companies in the leather&nbsp;trade are likely to cut prices to boost demand but this&nbsp;will depress profits. In the long run, some firms will&nbsp;leave the industry, reducing supply. This in turn will&nbsp;affect the factor markets. For instance, the demand by&nbsp;firms in the leather industry for workers, equipment and&nbsp;animals will fall. So wages of workers may fall. The&nbsp;price of land for cattle farms may fall too. Some workers&nbsp;will leave the industry attracted by higher wages&nbsp;elsewhere whilst land will be put to other uses. Meanwhile,&nbsp;consumers will have increased their spending on&nbsp;other goods, for instance on synthetic leather. In the&nbsp;short term the price of synthetic leather will rise.&nbsp;Increased profits will attract new firms into the industry,&nbsp;thus boosting supply. This will increase the demand&nbsp;for factors of production used in the making of synthetic&nbsp;leather.<br><br>If market prices are rising because of high and rising&nbsp;demand from consumers, this is a signal to suppliers to&nbsp;expand their production to meet the higher demand and&nbsp;more resources will be directed to produce that commodity&nbsp;and vice versa.<br><br>Thus in a market economy resources are allocated and&nbsp;reallocated through price mechanism according to the&nbsp;preferences of consumers.<br><br></li>
<li>A mixed economy is a mix of the two extremes, free&nbsp;market and planned economic system. It, therefore, could&nbsp;mean anything depending on the degree of mix.<br><br>The key features of such an economy include ownership&nbsp;of some of the country's factors of production&nbsp;publicly and some are owned privately. Thus, it involves&nbsp;both private and public sectors in the process of&nbsp;resource allocation. The price mechanism operates in&nbsp;the private sector; therefore, this part of the economy&nbsp;is motivated by self-interest. Firms aim to maximise&nbsp;profit, consumers maximise their welfare and the factor&nbsp;owners maximise rent, interest and profit. On the other&nbsp;hand the government plans and runs the public sector&nbsp;with the goal of "common good".<br><br>In a market economy the traditional role of a government&nbsp;is to protect the rights of individuals to keep private&nbsp;property. The government creates laws of ownership&nbsp;and contract and then provides the institutions to enforce&nbsp;these laws. In addition government has the authority to,&nbsp;issue currency and to prescribe weights and measures&nbsp;etc.<br><br>In a mixed economy the government goes well beyond&nbsp;these important basic functions. Not only does government&nbsp;directly control part of the economy, but it also&nbsp;intervenes in market transactions to correct what economists&nbsp;call market failures. These are well defined situations&nbsp;in which market forces do not effectively perform&nbsp;their coordinating function.<br><br>The first of these market failures is public goods such&nbsp;as national defense and street lights. These goods are&nbsp;not produced at all by markets because once provided,&nbsp;no one can be prevented from using them. The key point&nbsp;about public goods is that they are 'good' things, so they&nbsp;need to be provided, but, owing to their characteristics of&nbsp;non excludability and non rivalry, they have to be provided&nbsp;centrally by the government free of direct charges.<br><br>In other cases private sector allocates resources inefficiently,&nbsp;particularly in areas where goods are under&nbsp;consumed or over produced. With the idea of information&nbsp;failure, merit goods such as health care and education,&nbsp;are under produced and under consumed by the&nbsp;market forces. While demerit goods such as alcohol and&nbsp;tobacco smoking are over produced and over consumed.&nbsp;Prices in such cases reflect the need to achieve optimum&nbsp;allocation of resources through other means. So, government,&nbsp;in a mixed economy is required to intervene in&nbsp;order to correct these inefficiencies. Government can use&nbsp;various measures ranging from financial intervention i.e.&nbsp;indirect tax and subsidy to improving information, regulation&nbsp;and direct provision. They have, therefore, become&nbsp;primarily a government activity.<br><br>In other cases cost is imposed called negative externality&nbsp;on those who are not the party of transactions. This is&nbsp;the case when factories pollute the air and rivers. Conversely&nbsp;it is possible that the social benefits of a decision&nbsp;exceed the private benefits. If this is the case then&nbsp;positive externality is said to exist. The problem created&nbsp;by externalities is that the market forces lead to inappropriate&nbsp;amount of the product involved being produced.&nbsp;Thus government has to step in to influence&nbsp;market prices through indirect tax and subsidy with the&nbsp;view to improve allocation of resources.<br><br>Reliance on market forces also generates inequalities of&nbsp;income and wealth. There is, therefore, a role of government&nbsp;to redistribute income and wealth through its taxation&nbsp;and expenditure policy. In order to achieve equitable&nbsp;distribution of income governments develop welfare&nbsp;programmes - money collected through taxes is&nbsp;distributed to those who are deemed 'needy'.<br><br>In addition, government also plays a part in influencing&nbsp;the overall level of prices and in attempting to stabilize&nbsp;the economy against fluctuations in income and employment.&nbsp;In this area government intervention is geared&nbsp;towards creating a stable economic environment.<br><br>From the above it follows that prices have even a more&nbsp;important role to play in a mixed economy. This is&nbsp;because prices indicate the areas where government needs&nbsp;to intervene and manipulate the markets in order to&nbsp;improve allocation of scarce resources.</li>

<li>2007-2008 : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;6.16% = [(241-227)/227]&nbsp;× 100<br>2010-2011 : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.66% = [(261-247)/247]&nbsp;× 100<br>So it is lower in 2010-2011</li>
<li>Exchange rate refers to the external value of a country's currency. In a free market government does not intervene&nbsp;in the forex market and allows exchange rate to be determined by the market forces of demand and supply.&nbsp;Exchange rate changes as these forces change in the market. This can be explained with the help of the graph&nbsp;below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c2e7c797a4f86e177cbc9f4f70358157" alt="" width="312" height="270"><br><br>The original supply (S) and demand (D) curves intersect at point 'e' indicating equilibrium exchange rate at $1/100 .<br>So, for instance, an increase in interest rate in Pakistan increases capital inflows and hence an increase in demand<br>for Pak. Rs. as shown by a shift of demand curve to D<sub>1</sub>. Simultaneously the supply of Pak. Rs. falls as indicated&nbsp;by a shift in supply curve to S<sub>1</sub>. This is because there will be a fall in outflow of capital. Thus the equilibrium&nbsp;exchange rate rises from $1/100 to $1/99 .</li>
<li>Rising stock of foreign exchange reserves suggests that Chinese government is selling Yuan in order to accumulate&nbsp;its foreign currency reserves. This prevents an appreciation of Yuan which would make China's exports more&nbsp;expensive and imports dearer and hence turn its surplus into a deficit.</li>
<li>Economic theory suggests that a country loses its international competitiveness when either its price level rises&nbsp;or its currency appreciates. Both these factors cause export prices to rise and therefore result in a decrease in&nbsp;exports. At the same time the country's imports are expected to rise because appreciation of currency and a&nbsp;high rate of inflation make them relatively cheaper than the domestic goods.<br>However in case of China it is expected to be inconsistent. This could be explained with the help of J-curve&nbsp;effect. According to the theory price elasticity of demand of both exports and imports is less than one in the&nbsp;short run. Therefore a rise in prices of exports results in a proportionately smaller fall in their quantity, hence&nbsp;causes export earnings to increase. On the other hand inelasticity of demand for imports causes a fall in import&nbsp;bill thus improves current account balance. We can explain this with the help of the folowing graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f2b0fe3dcb09114427ef356560d5b321" alt="" width="377" height="204"><br><br>Appreciation of Yuan occurs at a time when the economy's current account is in surplus indicated by point&nbsp;A. Initially the trade surplus rises from point A to B. In the long run, however, appreciation is expected to&nbsp;erode this surplus due to the higher elasticity of demand for exports and imports.<br>Moreover the same result is obtained when either the relative increase in prices or appreciation of currencies&nbsp;is higher in other countries.</li>
<li>Appreciation of Yuan is expected to benefit Chinese consumers as they can then buy imports at lower prices. This&nbsp;should increase their consumer surplus and enable them to consume larger quantities of goods and services. Chinese&nbsp;producers might also benefit as the prices of imported capital goods fall. Moreover they will have access to cheaper&nbsp;imported raw material which might reduce their costs and increase profits. Swelling BOP surplus also causes money&nbsp;supply to expand and therefore results in higher inflation. Thus appreciation of Yuan will reduce inflow of money into&nbsp;Chinese economy and therefore will help to reduce inflationary pressure.<br>On the other hand a fall in net exports might cause job losses in China. A rise in imports, for instance, is expected&nbsp;to reduce the demand for local goods therefore causes domestic output to fall and workers to become redundant. Similarly&nbsp;an increase in prices of exports results in a fall in their demand therefore it is expected to affect both employment and&nbsp;output negatively.<br>So whether appreciation is of overall benefit to China depends on the elasticity of demand for its exports and imports&nbsp;and the level of dependence of Chinese economy on international trade.</li>

</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>An expenditure dampening policy is any action taken&nbsp;by a government that is designed to reduce the total&nbsp;level of spending in an economy. This will have two&nbsp;principal effects. First, a reduction in spending will mean&nbsp;that there will be fewer purchases of imported goods&nbsp;and services. Secondly, domestic producers will find that&nbsp;their domestic market is 'dampened' and is more difficult&nbsp;to sell in. As a result they may try to make up for&nbsp;the decrease in sales domestically with increases in sales&nbsp;abroad. The overall impact therefore should be a fall in&nbsp;imports and a rise in exports.<br>Expenditure dampening policies include deflationary fiscal&nbsp;and monetary measures.<br><br>Deflationary fiscal policy&nbsp;involves raising taxes and&nbsp;reducing government expenditure. Raising taxes will&nbsp;reduce disposable incomes meaning that less will be&nbsp;available to spend on imports. In addition the reduced&nbsp;government spending will lead to a downward multiplier&nbsp;effect which will depress incomes further.<br><br>On the other hand deflationary monetary policy involves&nbsp;raising interest rates and reducing the money supply. In&nbsp;addition to attracting inflows of foreign capital that will&nbsp;increase the demand for the currency on the foreign&nbsp;exchange market; increases in the rate of interest will&nbsp;reduce the money supply and deflate the economy. This&nbsp;is because the higher interest rate will reduce the demand&nbsp;for loans for consumption and investment and lead to&nbsp;a fall in aggregate monetary demand. The effects of such&nbsp;measures can be analyzed on the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/cd4c961f9e112893c7e9a6ad12044b06" alt="" width="284" height="186"><br><br>Aggregate demand (AD) shows various amounts of&nbsp;goods and services (real output) that domestic consumers,&nbsp;businesses, government, and foreign buyers collectively&nbsp;desire to purchase at each possible price level.&nbsp;Thus AD = C + I + G + X - M.<br><br>An aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the level of real&nbsp;domestic output which will be produced at each price&nbsp;level. Upward sloping AS suggests that higher price levels&nbsp;create an incentive for enterprises to produce and sell&nbsp;more, while lower price levels reduce output. Equilibrium&nbsp;output is where AD = AS.<br><br>To begin with let's assume that the economy is in equilibrium&nbsp;at Y<sub>1</sub> with AD<sub>1</sub> as the total demand for all goods&nbsp;and services and P<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;as the price level. As stated above, an&nbsp;expenditure dampening policy reduces AD, thus a combination&nbsp;of deflationary fiscal and monetary policy would&nbsp;reduce consumer spending (C) and capital spending (I),&nbsp;leading to a fall in AD from AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>. So when AD&nbsp;falls, firms will respond partly by reducing prices and&nbsp;partly by decreasing output. Just how much they reduce&nbsp;output and prices depends on how much their&nbsp;stocks rise. Thus the new equilibrium is found at lower&nbsp;output (Y<sub>2</sub>) and price level (P<sub>2</sub>).<br><br>If the government continues with deflationary measures,&nbsp;AD will further decrease to AD<sub>3</sub> leading to a further&nbsp;decrease in equilibrium output and price level.</li>
<li>An expenditure switching policy is any action taken by&nbsp;a government which is designed to persuade purchasers&nbsp;of goods and services both at home and abroad to&nbsp;purchase more of that country's goods and services and&nbsp;less of the goods and services produced by others.<br>Effectively this would include any policies designed to&nbsp;persuade domestic purchasers to purchase home-produced&nbsp;goods and services rather than imports. It would&nbsp;also include any policies designed to persuade foreign&nbsp;purchasers to buy more exports from your economy.&nbsp;These policies are not designed to reduce the total amount&nbsp;of spending in a country but to re-direct or 'switch'&nbsp;spending to the country's products rather than those&nbsp;produced in another country. Expenditure-switching&nbsp;policies include all protectionist measures that include&nbsp;tariffs, quotas, exchange controls, export subsidies and&nbsp;other technical barriers such as quality and safety standards.<br><br>All these measures interfere with market forces and&nbsp;prevent the consumer from benefiting from the effects&nbsp;of specialisation and trade. In addition a government's&nbsp;ability to resort to expenditure switching policies is&nbsp;limited by membership of the WTO (formerly the&nbsp;GATT). As a result they may be forced to resort to&nbsp;expenditure dampening policies.<br><br>With all the benefits expenditure switching policy may&nbsp;not be the first choice as they have other serious&nbsp;implications. Trade barriers in the form of tariffs and&nbsp;quotas for instance, push up the prices faced by consumers&nbsp;and insulate inefficient sectors from competition.&nbsp;Thus domestic consumers face higher prices, which&nbsp;means that there is a loss of consumer surplus. Eventually,&nbsp;consumers will pay more for a lower quality&nbsp;product than they would get from foreign competitors.&nbsp;It is often the case that the higher prices that result from&nbsp;tariffs hit those on lower incomes; hence, they may&nbsp;worsen the inequalities in the distribution of income&nbsp;making the allocation of scarce resources less equitable.&nbsp;Moreover, protectionist measures interfere with the&nbsp;operation of the market and encourage inefficient allocation&nbsp;of resources both domestically and globally. In&nbsp;general, tariffs impose costs on society that would not&nbsp;exist if there was completely free trade in goods and&nbsp;services.<br><br>So far as the large balance of payment current account&nbsp;deficit is concerned expenditure switching policies may&nbsp;help to reduce deficit only when the sum of elasticities&nbsp;of demand for country's exports and imports is greater&nbsp;than one. Since these measures usually result in a rise&nbsp;in prices of imports, therefore, may reduce import bill&nbsp;if PED for imports is greater than one. However when&nbsp;the sum of PED of exports and imports is less than one&nbsp;these policies only worsen current account deficit. Also,&nbsp;there is the danger that the country imposing import&nbsp;controls will lead to "retaliatory action" by its trading&nbsp;partners, eventually leading to a decrease in the volume&nbsp;of the country's exports.<br><br>In a situation of high rate of inflation and large deficit&nbsp;on current account of BOP, expenditure dampening policy&nbsp;may prove to be more effective. Since expenditure dampening policy is designed to reduce the total level&nbsp;of spending in an economy therefore, there will be fewer&nbsp;purchases of both domestic and imported goods and&nbsp;services. Furthermore, domestic producers will find that&nbsp;their domestic market is 'dampened' and is more difficult&nbsp;to sell in. As a result they may try to make up for&nbsp;the decrease in sales domestically with increases in sales&nbsp;abroad. The overall impact therefore should be a fall in&nbsp;the rate of inflation and imports and a rise in exports.&nbsp;However, the critics of expenditure dampening policy&nbsp;point out that they push the economy into recession as&nbsp;a decrease in the level of domestic investment and consumption, therefore leading to a lower output and employment.<br><br>From the above discussion it follows that expenditure&nbsp;dampening policy is more effective in a situation when&nbsp;a country has a large current account deficit and high&nbsp;inflation rate.</li>

So, governments all around&nbsp;take necessary actions to reduce the rate of smoking.&nbsp;Indirect tax is one of the various measures that governments&nbsp;adopt to reduce the rate of smoking.</p>
<p>An indirect tax is imposed on consumption. It is an&nbsp;example of direct government intervention in markets in&nbsp;order to raise money for its functioning and more&nbsp;importantly to influence allocation of resources among&nbsp;competing uses. Examples of indirect taxes include excise&nbsp;duties, VAT and sales tax on various products.</p>
<p>The ultimate liability of an indirect tax is on businesses&nbsp;thus, introduction of such a tax increases the costs of&nbsp;a business causing an inward shift in the supply curve.&nbsp;The effect is shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/41b21bdf694476580ff70e1420031ee5" alt="" width="318" height="199"></p>
<p>In case when there is no government intervention, the&nbsp;equilibrium in market for cigarettes occurs at pointe,&nbsp;where supply (MPC) equals demand (MPB). However&nbsp;if external costs are included in the diagram, then the&nbsp;supply curve becomes S<sub>1</sub> (MSC). The vertical distance&nbsp;between these two supply curves is marginal external&nbsp;cost (MEC) of smoking. The socially optimal level of&nbsp;consumption is equal to q<sub>1</sub>. Government imposes a tax&nbsp;which is equal to the MEC. The tax shifts the supply&nbsp;curve to S<sub>t</sub>, leading to an increase in price of cigarettes&nbsp;from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>. This is less than tax applied because&nbsp;producers decide to pass on only a portion of tax.</p>
<p>The firms will, of course, try to pass on to the consumers&nbsp;as much of the tax as possible by raising the price&nbsp;of the good. However their ability to raise price by the&nbsp;full amount of the tax is limited by elasticity of demand&nbsp;and supply. Thus tax raises revenue equal to P<sub>2</sub>e<sub>1</sub>mP<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>that government can use elsewhere to provide subsidy&nbsp;etc. Also, it helps to reduce the rate of smoking to the&nbsp;socially optimum level. However the critics argue that&nbsp;demand for cigarettes is highly inelastic, therefore&nbsp;increasing price will only cause a proportionately much&nbsp;smaller fall in demand. Furthermore, higher taxes increase&nbsp;inequality because the poor pay a higher percentage of&nbsp;their income as tax than the rich. Also, higher taxes&nbsp;encourage people to smuggle illegal cigerettes and avoid&nbsp;paying the tax.<br>So far our analysis suggests that an indirect tax on cigarettes&nbsp;shifts the supply curve to the left, therefore, it&nbsp;raises price. As a consequence consumers pay a higher&nbsp;price and consume less.</p>
<p>As far as imposing a complete ban on smoking is concerned&nbsp;it is argued that such laws may reduce health&nbsp;care costs, improve work productivity, and lower the&nbsp;overall cost of labour, hence making workforce more&nbsp;attractive for employers. Additional rationales for a&nbsp;complete ban on smoking include reduced risk of fire in&nbsp;areas with explosive hazards; cleanliness in places where&nbsp;food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, or precision&nbsp;instruments and machinery are produced; decreased legal&nbsp;liability; potentially reduced energy use via&nbsp;decreased ventilation needs; reduced quantities of litter;&nbsp;healthier environments; and giving smokers an incentive&nbsp;to quit.</p>
<p>However, a complete ban on smoking involves certain&nbsp;costs. The industry, for instance, employs a substantial&nbsp;number of workers and pays huge amount of taxes.&nbsp;Making smoking illegal is likely to make all those workers&nbsp;unemployed. At the same time government is likely to&nbsp;lose tax revenue that it could use to build schools,&nbsp;hospitals, public buildings and other infrastructure.&nbsp;Moreover, if smoking is completely banned the smokers&nbsp;who are unable to quit smoking would be forced into&nbsp;buying cigarettes illegally therefore a black market would&nbsp;develop leading to an increase in government spending&nbsp;on law enforcement.</p>
<p><br>In conclusion it can be deduced that smoking has many&nbsp;proven negative health effects on smokers and those&nbsp;around smokers, therefore, it must be regulated i.e government must adopt market based solutions to curb&nbsp;smoking. However, it should not be completely banned&nbsp;because outlawing smoking is most likely to create a&nbsp;black market or drive smokers to use other equally, or&nbsp;even more unhealthy, substances.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 166</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8940</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Use diagrams to explain the difference between merit&nbsp;goods and demerit goods.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>With the idea of a lack of information, a merit good is&nbsp;defined as a good that is better for a person than the&nbsp;person who may consume the good realizes. Thus the&nbsp;individuals who make decision about how much to&nbsp;consume do not fully appreciate the benefits of merit&nbsp;goods. Moreover, these goods create a divergence between&nbsp;the private and social costs and benefits of production&nbsp;and consumption therefore results in a risk of&nbsp;market failure. Thus the essence of merit good is to do&nbsp;with a failure of information to the consumer and&nbsp;spillover effects on non-consumers.</p>
<p>Good examples of merit goods include health services,&nbsp;education, work training programmes, public libraries etc.&nbsp;There is nothing inherent in any of these particular goods&nbsp;that makes them different from private goods. So, these&nbsp;goods can be supplied through the market and in some&nbsp;countries they actually are. However, consumer may&nbsp;not be able to purchase or feel the need to consume&nbsp;them up to the correct level i.e. socially optimum level.&nbsp;Thus the free market forces would not provide them in&nbsp;the quantities that society ought to consume. This is&nbsp;illustrated in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/d1de290989d46e2503342d8d62db571d" alt="" width="507" height="365"></p>
<p>Here the correct level of demand, if consumer fully&nbsp;appreciated the true value of the product, is D<sub>1</sub> (social&nbsp;benefit). This leads to a market price of P<sub>1</sub>, where marginal&nbsp;social benefits equal marginal social costs (supply&nbsp;curve). This price is associated with the socially optimum&nbsp;level of production and consumption of Q<sub>1</sub>, the optimum&nbsp;quantity of the good. Since consumers undervalue the&nbsp;product, therefore D<sub>2</sub> demand is registered. This leads to&nbsp;a market price of P<sub>2</sub> and production and consumption of&nbsp;Q<sub>2</sub>. This is below the optimum level, hence market has&nbsp;allocated insufficient amount of resources for the production&nbsp;of this good and, therefore resulted in welfare loss as&nbsp;shown by the shaded triangular area.</p>
<p>Demerit goods, on the other hand, are worse for the&nbsp;consumers than they realize. A demerit good is associated&nbsp;with negative externalities. However the reason for&nbsp;identifying these goods differently is to do with the&nbsp;failure of information to the consumers. Consumers do&nbsp;not fully realize how bad a particular good is for them.&nbsp;Either they do not have the right information or they&nbsp;simply lack some relevant information. The result is&nbsp;higher demand and overproduction of these goods. Figure&nbsp;below illustrates this.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/cb2c5e49df514ce72ff24a70f06bf9b3" alt="" width="403" height="278"></p>
<p>Here the correct demand is D<sub>2</sub> which should lead to a&nbsp;price of P<sub>2</sub> and a production of q<sub>2</sub>. As consumers overvalue&nbsp;the product, demand is registered at the higher&nbsp;level of D<sub>1</sub>. This leads to a market price p<sub>1</sub> and a production&nbsp;q<sub>1</sub>, that is higher than the socially desirable level&nbsp;of output q<sub>1</sub>.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 167</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8939</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In September 2011 the Kenyan government reintroduced price&nbsp;controls to ensure that basic commodities were sold to the&nbsp;citizens at reasonable prices.</p>

<li>In a market, price set by the forces of demand and&nbsp;supply, may not be the most desirable price. The government,&nbsp;therefore, may prefer to keep prices above or&nbsp;below the equilibrium price. If the government sets a&nbsp;minimum price above the market clearing price and&nbsp;prevents it from falling it is called price floor. Conversely,&nbsp;a maximum price set below the equilibrium price is called&nbsp;price ceiling.<br>Maximum price, often called price ceiling, is the maximum&nbsp;legal price that a seller is allowed to charge for a&nbsp;product. The price is not allowed to rise above this level&nbsp;but it is permitted to fall below it. Government uses&nbsp;price ceiling in circumstances when equilibrium price set&nbsp;by the market forces for some essential product is&nbsp;unfairly high and it may not be affordable for less&nbsp;privileged. Price controls on oil, natural gas and rental&nbsp;housing are frequently imposed by many governments&nbsp;around the world. So, if the maximum price is set below&nbsp;the free market equilibrium price, the price ceiling lowers&nbsp;the price and is said to be binding or effective. Let's&nbsp;consider the following diagram.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/3e132251ee92113717f6dd1cefa67a1e" alt="" width="315" height="205"><br><br>The free market equilibrium price of a product is at 'p'&nbsp;and quantity traded is Q. If, however, government fixes&nbsp;a maximum at Pi at this lower price, producers, particularly&nbsp;those with higher costs, will supply Q<sub>2</sub>. Consumers,&nbsp;on the other hand, will demand more at this low&nbsp;price; they would like to purchase the quantity Q<sub>2</sub>. So&nbsp;demand exceeds supply, and a shortage Q<sub>2</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub> develops.<br>As a consequence of maximum price some people gain&nbsp;and some lose. As the graph above clearly suggests, producers&nbsp;lose - they receive lower price, and some might&nbsp;leave the industry. Consumers who can purchase petrol&nbsp;at a lower price are clearly better off, but those who&nbsp;cannot buy petrol due to the shortage are worse off.&nbsp;The gain to consumers is the difference between rectangle&nbsp;D and triangle B. The loss to producers is the sum&nbsp;of rectangle D and triangle C. Triangles B and C together&nbsp;measure the deadweight welfare loss from price controls.<br>If, however, the ceiling is set above the equilibrium price,&nbsp;it has no effect, since the equilibrium remains attainable.&nbsp;Let's consider the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ea4737a58db90ef152f3e2dcb46c8e85" alt="" width="289" height="213"><br><br>Figure above illustrates the case when government fixes&nbsp;the maximum price above the market equilibrium price.&nbsp;Here OP and Oq are the equilibrium price and quantity&nbsp;that would prevail without government reg-ulation. The&nbsp;government, however, decides that price cannot be higher&nbsp;than P<sub>max</sub> but it allows the price to be charged at any&nbsp;level below this. Since the market equilibrium price OP&nbsp;is below P<sub>max</sub>, therefore, the market will continue to&nbsp;operate at the same equilibrium price.<br>Thus it can be concluded that a maximum price affects&nbsp;the market only when it is fixed below the market equilibrium&nbsp;price.</li>
<li>Since effective maximum price undermines the rationing&nbsp;ability of the price mechanism, therefore, at the ceiling&nbsp;price there is a lasting shortage of the product. In this&nbsp;situation when quantity supplied is insufficient to satisfy&nbsp;everyone who wishes to buy the good, some other&nbsp;methods of allocation must be adopted. Sellers, for&nbsp;instance, may sell their available supplies on a "first&nbsp;come, first served" basis. Then people will rush to stores&nbsp;that are said to have stocks of the product. Long queues&nbsp;of buyers may develop, and allocation will be on the&nbsp;basis of luck. Alternatively sellers may keep products&nbsp;under the counter and sell only on the basis of favoritism.&nbsp;Both of these ways of rationing goods might be&nbsp;considered as unfair - because it is likely that eventually&nbsp;those who might have the greatest need for a commodity&nbsp;are unlikely to have their needs met.<br>In such situations government can choose to ration the&nbsp;product. Rationing is when the government limits the&nbsp;amount of a good that people are allowed to purchase.&nbsp;The authorities can ration the goods by giving out ration&nbsp;coupons sufficient to buy the available supply. The&nbsp;coupons might be distributed equally or on the basis of&nbsp;some criterion such as age, family income or occupation.&nbsp;A major consequence of maximum price, with or without&nbsp;rationing, is the emergence of black markets. This&nbsp;is a market in which the good will be sold illegally at&nbsp;whatever price equates illegal demand and supply. The&nbsp;existence of such a market depends on there being a few&nbsp;people willing to risk heavy penalties by running a black&nbsp;market and a large number of consumers prepared to&nbsp;purchase the product on such a market. Consider the&nbsp;graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8835da118fae6681d5a2c98950daf14d" alt="" width="332" height="215"><br><br>Government, considering the free market price OP&nbsp;unacceptably high, fixes the maximum price OP<sub>1</sub>. This&nbsp;leads to a lasting shortage of Q<sub>2</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub>. In order to improve&nbsp;the situation government introduces a rationing&nbsp;system. The demand curve shows that there will always&nbsp;be some consumers prepared to pay a price considerably&nbsp;above P<sub>1</sub>. This is where black marketers come in.&nbsp;Let's take the extreme case and assume that black&nbsp;marketers, for instance, would buy Q<sub>2</sub> quantity at the&nbsp;controlled price P<sub>1</sub> paying the amount shown by rectangle&nbsp;E. They would then sell Q<sub>2</sub> at the price p<sub>2</sub>, earning&nbsp;profits shown by the sum of rectangles A and D.<br>Thus black marketers clearly frustrate the objective of&nbsp;the government to hold the price where the good is in&nbsp;excess of the lower income group. Perhaps it is impossible&nbsp;for any government to eliminate black marketing&nbsp;altogether, however, enforcement of laws and strict&nbsp;actions may help to reduce the volumes traded in black&nbsp;markets.<br>Besides rationing, government can adopt other measures&nbsp;to alter either demand or supply to minimize the shortage.&nbsp;Government may attempt, for instance, to encourage&nbsp;supply by drawing on stocks if available or else it&nbsp;can increase production by direct involvement. Situation&nbsp;can also improve if government gives subsidies or tax&nbsp;relief to producers. All these measures would help to&nbsp;increase market supply and therefore reduce the level of&nbsp;shortage. However, these are costly measures and the&nbsp;burden might fall on tax payers. Alternatively, government&nbsp;may attempt to reduce demand by advertisement,&nbsp;by encouraging production of substitute products or by&nbsp;controlling people's incomes.<br>Thus it can be concluded that effective maximum price&nbsp;on its own may not benefit the all the consumers unless&nbsp;government takes further actions to deal with the problems&nbsp;followed by shortage.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">When hyperinflation takes control numbers become enormous. This was Zimbabwe's experience in 2007 and&nbsp;2008. Professor Steve H. Hanke of The Cato Institute calculated that in November 2008 Zimbabwe's annual&nbsp;inflation rate reached over 89 sextillion percent. This means 89 followed by 21 zeros.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many stories about the Zimbabwe dollar (Z$) in this period. In July 2008 an egg cost Z$50 billion,&nbsp;a bottle of beer rose in price from Z$100 billion to Z$150 billion in an hour and shopkeepers would only&nbsp;accept cheques (checks) if they were written to a value twice the amount owed by the customer. Prices of&nbsp;goods rose to trillions and quadrillions of Zimbabwe dollars. In six months the price of a loaf of bread rose&nbsp;from Z$200000 to Z$1.6 trillion and the government introduced the Z$100 trillion banknote.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One way to make the figures more meaningful is to quote a daily rate of inflation or the time it takes prices&nbsp;to double. Table 1 gives this for three famous hyperinflations.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Inflation is defined as a persistent and generalized increase in the level of prices. A very high rate of&nbsp;inflation is known as hyperinflation. When this happens value of money falls at an extremely rapid&nbsp;rate and people lose confidence in money and may even go back to barter.</li>
<li>Value of money fell in Zimbabwe each day by approximately 50%.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hyperinflation often occurs when a government allows money supply to grow excessively that is not&nbsp;supported by growth in output. Left unchecked it leads to an imbalance in the supply and demand for&nbsp;the money and therefore causes prices to increase at a severe rate. Monetarists quantity theory of money&nbsp;MV= PT explains this.<br>Money supply in circulation as determined by the monetary authorities (M) multiplied by the average&nbsp;number of times money changes hands (V), being identical to the average price level (P) multiplied by the&nbsp;total number of transaction (T). The argument is that in the long run the velocity of circulation of money&nbsp;and total output is assumed to be constant because V depends on payment pattern and Y remains the same&nbsp;as the economy will return to full employment in the· tong run. Hence a change in money supply will cause&nbsp;a proportionate change in the price level. In addition to this other measures by the government such as&nbsp;lowering interest rate to a very low level or excessive cuts in tax rates could also generate hyper inflation.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Since the value of money declined on hourly basis and the process to withdraw cash against cheques&nbsp;takes time, therefore, shopkeepers demanded a premium twice the original value in order to compensate&nbsp;for the loss of real value per hour due to hyperinflation.</li>
<li>Hyperinflation erodes the real value of wages quickly and manifold. Hence workers, in order to&nbsp;maintain real wages, might react by demanding higher money wages as frequently and as much as&nbsp;increase in the price level. Alternatively, they might refuse to accept wages in money terms and instead&nbsp;demand for wages to be paid in terms of goods.<br>Hyperinflation tends to cause uncertainty among the foreign investors, particularly when rapidly&nbsp;increased costs cannot be matched by price increases. If it is difficult for investors to predict their&nbsp;costs and revenues, they may be discouraged from investing. Thus hyperinflation might result in&nbsp;foreign investors to defer their investment decisions eventually causing a fall in foreign investment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hyperinflation in a country causes a rapid increase in export prices and therefore results in lower demand&nbsp;for exports. If demand for exports is elastic and nothing else changes then the earnings from exports are&nbsp;expected to decline. At the same time hyperinflation makes the prices of domestically produced goods to&nbsp;become relatively higher than those of imported goods, therefore, results in more imports leading to an&nbsp;increase in import bill. Thus a decrease in export earnings and an increase in import bill are expected to&nbsp;lead to a growing trade deficit.<br>However, the impact on current account depends, firstly, on the changes in other components, net flow&nbsp;of income and net transfers for instance, and secondly, the changes in offsetting factors such as exchange&nbsp;rate, elasticities of demand and government regulations. So, when a fall in demand for exports and a rise&nbsp;in demand for imports eventually causes exchange rate to depreciate it is expected to compensate for price&nbsp;changes of exports and imports. Similarly, when hyper inflation erodes the country's international competitiveness,&nbsp;the extent to which it contributes to the growing deficit in current account depends on the&nbsp;sum of PED of exports and imports.<br>Zimbabwe's current account deficit grew by approximately 137% (from US $383millions to $906 million)&nbsp;during 2007 and 2008. At the same time trade in goods registered 230% increase in deficit. These figures&nbsp;are consistent with what can be expected according to the theory. However, considering that Zimbabwe&nbsp;had the highest rate of inflation, the impact on current account could have been much worse without the&nbsp;compensatory factors such as a depreciation of exchange rate, elasticity of demand for imports and exports&nbsp;and actions by Zimbabwean government.</li>

<li>Governments measure changes in general price level in&nbsp;order to determine the changes in the value of money&nbsp;and its impact on the economy in general. For governments&nbsp;rate of inflation is a central economic target therefore,&nbsp;forms the basis of their economic policy. This is&nbsp;because part of government spending which is linked to&nbsp;the rate of inflation such as public sector wages and&nbsp;pensions would be affected a great deal by high and low&nbsp;rate of inflation. More than that success of government&nbsp;economic policy is usually judged from the extent to&nbsp;which government achieves its targeted rate of inflation.<br>Governments use a variety of different measures in order&nbsp;to determine whether the general price levels on average&nbsp;are rising or falling and so the rate at which they&nbsp;are changing. Of these measures most commonly known&nbsp;are consumer price index (CPI), retail price index (RPI)&nbsp;and wholesale price index (WPI).<br><br>RPI and CPI are the main measures used to record&nbsp;changes in the level of the prices most people pay for&nbsp;the goods and services they buy. RPI is intended to&nbsp;reflect the average spending pattern of the great majority&nbsp;of private households. Only two classes of private&nbsp;households are excluded, on the grounds that their spending&nbsp;patterns differ greatly from those of the others:&nbsp;pensioner households and high-income households. The&nbsp;CPI, however, has a wider remit-it is intended to reflect&nbsp;the spending of all residents, and also covers some costs&nbsp;incurred by foreign visitors.<br><br>On the other hand, the Wholesale Price Index or WPI&nbsp;is the price of a representative basket of wholesale&nbsp;goods. Some countries use the changes in this index to&nbsp;measure inflation in their economies. The WPI focuses&nbsp;on the price of goods traded between corporations, rather&nbsp;than goods bought by consumers, which is measured by&nbsp;the CPI or RPI. The purpose of the WPI is to monitor&nbsp;price movements that reflect supply and demand in&nbsp;industry, manufacturing and construction. This helps in&nbsp;analyzing both macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions.<br><br>As mentioned above CPI records changes in the general&nbsp;level of prices paid by consumers for all the goods and&nbsp;services they buy. Its calculation involves three main&nbsp;stages.<br><br>Firstly, a survey is conducted to find out what families&nbsp;buy and how much they spend on particular items. The&nbsp;findings from the survey help economists to select items&nbsp;and to assign relative weights to individual commodities&nbsp;according to the percentage of income spent on each&nbsp;commodity by an average household. Then comes the&nbsp;second stage of recording how much the prices of selected&nbsp;items have changed, the information is collected&nbsp;from all main retail outlets and from utility providers&nbsp;such as gas, water and transport etc.<br><br>Once the prices have been recorded, at the third and last&nbsp;stage the percentage change in price for each item is then&nbsp;multiplied by its weights. From this the average change&nbsp;in the CPI is determined. This is illustrated with the&nbsp;help of the table given below.<br><br>

<br>The price index for each category shows what has&nbsp;happened to the price level since a base year value. To&nbsp;generate a weighted price index we multiply the price&nbsp;index for each category by its weight. We then divide&nbsp;the sum of weighted index on the sum of weights to find&nbsp;an overall price index (974.5 / 9 = 108.3). If the index&nbsp;is calculated to be over 100 in year 1, then on average&nbsp;price level has increased compared with the base year&nbsp;(year 0 = 100). In our example index in year 1 is 108.3,&nbsp;then price level has risen by 8.3% since the base year.&nbsp;An index of below 100 in year 1 would indicate a fall&nbsp;in average price level.<br><br></li>
<li>Inflation is a persistent and generalized increase in the&nbsp;level of prices. The term persistent implies that average&nbsp;of all prices is rising year in and year out. Government&nbsp;tries to control rate of inflation because it brings undesirable&nbsp;income distortions. Firstly the fixed income earners are made effectively poorer. This is because inflation&nbsp;erodes the real value of their fixed incomes. On the other&nbsp;hand profit earners or people who manage to increase&nbsp;their money incomes than the rate of inflation gain.&nbsp;Secondly borrowers gain and lenders lose. This is because&nbsp;the real value of loans paid back is lower.<br>Moreover inflation tends to cause uncertainty among&nbsp;the business community, especially when the rate of&nbsp;inflation fluctuates. If it is difficult for firms to predict&nbsp;their costs and revenues, they may be discouraged from&nbsp;investing. This will reduce the rate of economic growth.&nbsp;On the other hand, policies to reduce the rate of inflation&nbsp;may themselves reduce the rate of economic growth,&nbsp;especially in the short run. This may then provide the&nbsp;government with a policy dilemma.<br><br>Furthermore, inflation is likely to worsen the balance of&nbsp;payments. If a country suffers from relatively high&nbsp;inflation, its exports will become less competitive in&nbsp;world markets. At the same time, imports will become&nbsp;relatively cheaper than home-produced goods. Thus&nbsp;exports will fall and imports will rise. As a result the&nbsp;balance of payments will deteriorate and the exchange&nbsp;rate will fall.<br><br>Firms have to employ extra resources to cope with the&nbsp;effects of inflation. Accountants and other financial&nbsp;experts may have to be employed by companies to help&nbsp;them cope with the uncertainties caused by inflation.&nbsp;The costs of inflation may be relatively mild if inflation&nbsp;is kept to single figures. They can be very serious,&nbsp;however If inflation develops into "hyperinflation" with&nbsp;prices rising perhaps by several hundred per cent or&nbsp;even thousands per cent per year, the whole basis of&nbsp;free market economy will be undermined. Firms constantly&nbsp;raise prices in an attempt to cover their rocketing&nbsp;costs. Workers demand huge pay increases in an&nbsp;attempt to stay ahead of the rocketing cost of living.&nbsp;Thus prices and wages chase each other in an ever-rising&nbsp;inflationary spiral. Also people will no longer want to&nbsp;save money. Instead they will spend it as quickly as&nbsp;possible before its value falls. People may even resort&nbsp;to barter in an attempt to avoid using money altogether.&nbsp;Furthermore, price increases are deeply unpopular. People&nbsp;feel that they are worse off, even if their incomes rise&nbsp;by more the rate of inflation. High rates of inflation,&nbsp;particularly if they are unexpected, disturb the distribution&nbsp;of income and wealth and therefore profoundly affect&nbsp;the existing social order.<br><br>Productivity, on the other hand, is a measure of efficiency&nbsp;with which a country combines capital and labour&nbsp;to produce more with the same level of factor inputs.&nbsp;We commonly focus on labour productivity that is measured&nbsp;by output per person employed or output per&nbsp;person per hour. A better measure of productivity growth&nbsp;is total factor productivity which takes into account&nbsp;changes in the amount of capital to use and also changes&nbsp;in the size of the labour force. To give a numerical&nbsp;example, if the size of the capital stock grows by 3%&nbsp;and the employed workforce expands by 2% and output&nbsp;(GDP) increases by 8%, then total factor productivity&nbsp;has increased by 3%.<br><br>Productivity of labour largely depends on the level ot&nbsp;education and training. Thus investment m education&nbsp;has the potential to raise the skills within the work&nbsp;force and therefore can increase their productivity levels.&nbsp;In addition, The rate of growth of output per worker&nbsp;employed increases with the increase in the amount of&nbsp;capital per worker. Thus raising investment is a key&nbsp;ingredient in helping labour productivity to grow.<br><br>Technological improvements can increase the productivity&nbsp;of capital. The source of technical progress is research&nbsp;and development. Thus higher the economy&nbsp;spends on research and development the more productive&nbsp;capital and the higher the productivity growth.<br><br>Productivity growth benefits the economy in many&nbsp;different ways. Firstly, it can lead to lower unit costs.&nbsp;These cost savings might be passed onto consumers in&nbsp;lower prices, encouraging higher demand, more output&nbsp;and an increase in employment. Also productivity growth&nbsp;and lower unit costs are key determinants of the competitiveness&nbsp;of firms in global markets. Thus lower costs&nbsp;and resulting efficiency gains are a source of larger profits&nbsp;for companies which might be re-invested to support the&nbsp;long term growth of the business. Secondly, businesses&nbsp;can afford higher wages when their workers are more efficient.&nbsp;These higher wages will boost consumption, generate&nbsp;more tax revenue to pay for public goods and perhaps&nbsp;give freedom for tax cuts on people and businesses.<br><br>Finally, productivity improvements mean that labour can&nbsp;be released from one industry and be made available for&nbsp;another - for example, rising efficiency in farming will&nbsp;increase production yields and provide more food either&nbsp;to export or to supply a growing urban population.<br><br>Thus it follows that both, controlling the rate of inflation&nbsp;and productivity growth, are important to achieve.&nbsp;The former is important for achieving macroeconomic&nbsp;stability but the latter is important in terms of bringing&nbsp;improvement in the economy in general. Thus it can be&nbsp;said that controlling inflation rate is a better objective&nbsp;for the governments to achieve in the short run. However,&nbsp;in the long run without productivity growth macroeconomic&nbsp;stability cannot be achieved.&nbsp;</li>

It&nbsp;is just one of the four parts of current account in a&nbsp;country's balance of payment. While depreciation of a&nbsp;currency refers to a fall in the free market exchange rate&nbsp;of domestic currency against a foreign currency and&nbsp;devaluation is a deliberate attempt by the authorities to&nbsp;reduce the value of its currency.</p>
<p>If an economy is operating under a fixed exchange rate&nbsp;regime then a devaluation of its currency will make the&nbsp;country's exports cheaper in terms of foreign currency&nbsp;and its imports dearer in terms of domestic currency.&nbsp;However if the economy is operating under a floating&nbsp;exchange rate regime then a depreciation will have the&nbsp;same effect. Whether a devaluation or depreciation is&nbsp;successful in improving a country's trade balance depends&nbsp;on the price elasticity of demand for exports and&nbsp;imports.</p>
<p>The importance of these elasticities of demand are generalized&nbsp;in the Marshall-lerner condition. This implies&nbsp;that depreciation will lead to an improvement in an&nbsp;economy's trade balance only if the sum of price elasticity&nbsp;of demand for its exports and imports is greater&nbsp;than unity i.e. elastic. This can be outlined by reference&nbsp;to the figures below where, following a depreciation of&nbsp;currency, the price of imports increases and the price of&nbsp;exports decreases.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/64fc83d5795f5f95fd925523c7ef42e5" alt="" width="300" height="229"><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0726875ee1cc737138a47509e1ec6d05" alt="" width="324" height="239"></p>
<p>In figure (a) the depreciation of domestic currency has&nbsp;resulted in a reduction in the foreign price of exports&nbsp;from P to P<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>and an increase in demand for exports from&nbsp;X to X<sub>1</sub>. Given the elastic demand for exports, this will&nbsp;lead to a reduction in export earnings by area A, but at&nbsp;the same time there will be an increase in exports earnings&nbsp;by the area B. Since the larger proportionate change&nbsp;in quantity demanded outweighs the smaller proportion&nbsp;ate fall in price, therefore, depreciation results in an&nbsp;increase in export earnings by (B - A).</p>
<p>In figure (b) a depreciation of the domestic currency has&nbsp;increased the price of imports in local currency from P&nbsp;to P<sub>1</sub> and reduced their demand from M to M<sub>1</sub>. This&nbsp;leads to an increase in expenditure on imports by the&nbsp;area C but a reduction in expenditure of area D. Thus&nbsp;there is an overall reduction in expenditure on imports&nbsp;of (C - D) because the demand for imports is elastic.&nbsp;In terms of trade balance, the effect will have been&nbsp;improvement of (B - A) + (C - D).</p>
<p>So long as the elasticity conditions are favourable, depreciation&nbsp;will lead to an improvement in the balance of&nbsp;trade position. However, elasticity conditions are unlikely&nbsp;to be favourable in the short run. It takes time for&nbsp;people to adjust their patterns of consumption therefore,&nbsp;foreign currency spending on imports is largely&nbsp;unchanged. The result is that depreciation initially leads&nbsp;to an increased trade deficit On the other hand foreign&nbsp;currency earnings fall because much the same volume of&nbsp;exports are sold at lower price in foreign currency Hence&nbsp;initially the trade balance deteriorates after depreciation.&nbsp;Thus depreciation only leads to an improvement in the&nbsp;trade balance in the long run. The initial deterioration&nbsp;and subsequent improvement in the trade balance is&nbsp;usually referred to as the 'J curve' effect as shown in&nbsp;the graph below.</p>

<p>A depreciation of the currency occurs at a time when&nbsp;the economy is at point A. Initially the trade deficit will&nbsp;worsen, illustrate by a movement to point B. After a&nbsp;period of time, however, the trade deficit will reduce&nbsp;and a situation such as point C could be obtained.</p>
<p>In conclusion depreciation or devaluation is likely to&nbsp;improve trade balance in the long run when the sum of&nbsp;elasticity of demand for exports and imports is greater&nbsp;than one.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 171</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8923</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what determines the demand for and supply of&nbsp;a currency in the foreign exchange market.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The exchange rate essentially reflects the external value&nbsp;of a country's currency. According to the economic theory&nbsp;it is determined by the demand and supply forces on&nbsp;the foreign exchange market and represents the rate at&nbsp;which one currency can be exchanged for another currency.</p>
<p>In outlining the determination of exchange rate of a&nbsp;particular country we will make the assumption that the&nbsp;two countries are involved, namely Pakistan and US.&nbsp;The exchange rate is, therefore, US$ in terms of Rs.&nbsp;Consider the following graph:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/83ef88484c11331e2cf9fac5d1520664" alt="" width="355" height="263"></p>
<p>Demand for $ is drawn downward sloping because lower&nbsp;the price of $ in terms of Rs. the cheaper it is to import&nbsp;goods and services from US or to buy assets in US and&nbsp;therefore, the higher the quantity demanded of $. While&nbsp;the supply curve of $ is upward sloping because a higher&nbsp;price of $ in terms of Rs. makes it cheaper for US&nbsp;buyers and investors to import Pakistani goods or buy&nbsp;assets in Pakistan. Thus the higher the price of US$&nbsp;measured in terms of Pak RS. the greater its supply in&nbsp;the forex market and vice versa. So, in the graph above,&nbsp;the intersection of demand and supply gives an equilibrium&nbsp;exchange rate Rs. 100 = 1$. Any rate above will&nbsp;create surplus and below will cause a shortage of $.&nbsp;However, this surplus or shortage will be corrected by&nbsp;the movement in exchange rate.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of influences on both the&nbsp;demand and supply of currencies which shift the equilibrium&nbsp;and therefore may cause appreciation or depreciation&nbsp;in exchange rate.</p>
<p>An increase in demand for country's exports will lead&nbsp;to an increase in demand for its currency on the exchange&nbsp;rate market. The result of this will be a shift in&nbsp;the demand curve to the right and, therefore an appreciation&nbsp;of country's currency. Likewise a decrease in&nbsp;demand for the country's exports would cause the demand&nbsp;for its currency to shift to the left resulting in&nbsp;depreciation. Similarly an increase in demand for imports&nbsp;will have the effect of shifting the supply curve&nbsp;of its currency to the right and, therefore, will result in&nbsp;depreciation of the county's currency on the foreign&nbsp;exchange market.</p>
<p>Moreover a rise in the country's rate of interest relative&nbsp;to other country's rate is likely to attract short-term&nbsp;foreign capital flows into the country's financial institutions.&nbsp;This inflow of hot money will increase the&nbsp;demand for local currency and therefore lead to an&nbsp;appreciation. Likewise a decrease in rate of interest relative&nbsp;to other countries will result in capital outflow and&nbsp;hence an increase in supply of local currency will result&nbsp;in depreciation.</p>
<p>Also a rise in the country's rate of inflation relative to&nbsp;the country's trading partners will, other things being&nbsp;equal, reduce the demand for the country's exports and&nbsp;increase the demand for country's imports. There will&nbsp;thus be a reduction in the demand for the country's&nbsp;currency and increase in the demand. The result will be&nbsp;depreciation of the country's currency in the foreign&nbsp;exchange market.</p>
<p>On daily basis the major determinant of demand and&nbsp;supply of currencies are people's expectations about&nbsp;changes in exchange rate in near future. If people think&nbsp;that the exchange rate is about to fall, they will sell local&nbsp;currency before the rate actually falls. The supply of&nbsp;local currency thus rises leading to a depreciation. At&nbsp;the same time people requiring local currency will wait&nbsp;until the rate has fallen before they purchase them. Thus&nbsp;the demand for local currency falls.</p>
<p>Over time the pattern of trade is likely to change due&nbsp;to various other factors such as changes in taste, quality&nbsp;of goods and cost of production etc. All of them will&nbsp;affect the country's exports and imports leading to a&nbsp;change in exchange rate.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 172</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8920</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the ease with which a planned economy may&nbsp;be changed into a market economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An economic system comprises of all the institutional&nbsp;means through which scarce national resources are used&nbsp;to satisfy human wants. Free market economy and&nbsp;planned economy are two such systems.</p>
<p>A free market is typically characterized by limited involvement&nbsp;of government m the economy coupled with&nbsp;individual ownership of the means of production. Indviduals can pursue their own self-interest without many&nbsp;constraints. Free market is thus one where decision&nbsp;making rs decentralized and resource allocation takes&nbsp;place through price system, also known as invisible hand.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in a command economy government&nbsp;controls the factor of production and makes all key decisions&nbsp;about their use and about the distribution of&nbsp;income. Thus decision making is a centralized process.&nbsp;The complete opposite of the pure self-interest of the&nbsp;free market system, consumers. workers and the government&nbsp;are all assumed to be working for the 'common&nbsp;good'. There is no competition, so there is no price&nbsp;mechanism. The authorities set the prices. As the government&nbsp;runs the system, they have the job of planning&nbsp;how all the resources should be used.</p>
<p>The task of reforming a centrally planned economy into&nbsp;a market economy is enormous. It requires the government&nbsp;to establish the foundations of a fully functioning&nbsp;market economy. Government, for instance needs to&nbsp;initiate reforms such as price and trade liberalization&nbsp;privatization and reforms in the financial sector. In a&nbsp;command system prices bear no relation with demand&nbsp;and supply. By freeing prices from state government&nbsp;will allow the free functioning of market forces that should&nbsp;benefit the economy with efficiency gains in the long&nbsp;run. Liberalizing prices does not make much sense&nbsp;without trade liberalization which will create competition.&nbsp;In theory trade liberalization can be achieved fairly&nbsp;quickly by removing the state monopoly on trade, all&nbsp;tariff, quotas and non-tariff barriers to trade and by&nbsp;allowing the currency to be convertible.</p>
<p>Moreover, to create fully functioning market economy&nbsp;state enterprises need to be turned into profit-motivated&nbsp;private sector firms. Private ownership is not enough on&nbsp;its own to guarantee success. There is also a need to&nbsp;improve management techniques especially in the area&nbsp;of quality control and financial management. For the&nbsp;existing managers it may take some time to acquire these&nbsp;skills, therefore, could delay the transition process.</p>
<p>Financial reforms include the establishment of central&nbsp;bank and creating commercial banking institutions and&nbsp;other financial markets. Attracting foreign direct investment&nbsp;is also important for successful transition in that&nbsp;it allows the transfer of technology and management&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<p>However, the process of transition can be lengthy and&nbsp;painful for the whole nation. Price liberalization, for instance,&nbsp;is likely to result in a big jump in prices. Under&nbsp;a command system shortages meant that consumers are&nbsp;unable to get hold of goods and services they want. This&nbsp;results in spare cash available to the citizens and once&nbsp;prices are liberalized this excess demand comes into the&nbsp;open. Production, in the short run, is unable to meet&nbsp;this excess demand and prices rise dramatically. With&nbsp;trade libralzation the country's imports may increase&nbsp;massively leading to a decline in domestic output and&nbsp;large scale unemployment. This reduction in economic&nbsp;activity has two major consequences for the government&nbsp;finances. Firstly the government tax revenue falls. Secondly&nbsp;government needs to spend even more on social&nbsp;services such as transport, housing and even health care.&nbsp;Budget deficit, therefore can swell to a dangerous level.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that transition from command&nbsp;to free market system is a massive task and therefore,&nbsp;requires a well thought out process in order to avoid or&nbsp;at least to reduce the costs involved in the process.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 173</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8911</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, with the help of a production possibility diagram, how the opportunity cost of producing different combinations of goods can be measured.

can&nbsp;produce within a specified time period with the given&nbsp;state of technology when all its resources are fully and&nbsp;efficiently employed. The idea of production possibilities&nbsp;is usually shown graphically as given below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/55734a1bc4bd925c66a2cd14fc9e9467" alt="" width="397" height="340"><br><br>In the graph above each point on the PPC represents&nbsp;maximum output of capital goods and consumer goods.&nbsp;The country must achieve full employment and productive&nbsp;efficiency in order to operate at any point on the&nbsp;PPC. However, if the economy were at point G, there&nbsp;would be unemployed resources and by bringing those&nbsp;resources into use the economy could move to any point&nbsp;on the PPC. Points outside the frontier such as H are&nbsp;unattainable with the current supplies of resources and&nbsp;technology.<br>Primarily the negative slope of the PPC can be viewed&nbsp;in terms of scarcity of resources and opportunity cost.&nbsp;Opportunity cost is often referred to as the real cost&nbsp;measured in terms of the next best alternative&nbsp;sacrificed. Construction of a new sports complex, for&nbsp;instance, might involve sacrificing the construction of a&nbsp;number of houses from the same resources. In this case&nbsp;we say that the opportunity cost of constructing a sports&nbsp;complex is the housing which is sacrificed.<br>To be precise a PPC shows that obtaining more of one&nbsp;type of output requires having less of the other. On the&nbsp;graph above as we move down from point A along the&nbsp;PPC we can measure the opportunity cost because more&nbsp;units of consumer goods needs resources to be taken&nbsp;from the production of capital goods, i.e. there is an&nbsp;alternative forgone. Thus at point A the opportunity&nbsp;cost of 30 million units of consumer goods involves 25&nbsp;million units of capital goods sacrificed. A movement&nbsp;from A to B involving the production of 5 million units&nbsp;of capital goods requires a reduction of 2 million units&nbsp;in the production of consumer goods with an opportunity&nbsp;cost of 0.4 i.e. one unit of capital has been gained&nbsp;at the expense of 0.4 units of consumer goods. Similarly&nbsp;in moving from B to C an extra 5 million units of capital&nbsp;goods production will mvolve a reduction in consumer&nbsp;goods production of 3 million units, with a resulting&nbsp;opportunity cost of 0.6. Finally a movement from E to&nbsp;F, again with an extra 5 million units of capital&nbsp;production, will require forgoing 15 million units of&nbsp;consumer goods with an opportunity cost of 3.0 The&nbsp;opportunity cost decreases as we move down the negatively&nbsp;sloping concave PPC.<br>However, the movement from point G to any point on&nbsp;the PPC within the shaded area will involve zero opportunity&nbsp;cost. This is because the economy can increase its output of both goods simultaneously by simply using the unemployed resources. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;concept of opportunity cost cannot be applied to point&nbsp;H or any other point outside PPC. This is because the&nbsp;available resources do not allow the economy to obtain&nbsp;those quantities of either goods.<br>Thus opportunity cost of different combination of goods&nbsp;can be measured on a PPC.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 174</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8909</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Price of Sugar</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In August 2009, sugar reached its highest price for 28 years at 23 US cents per pound of sugar.&nbsp;Changes in the price of sugar and in average food prices are shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Fig. 1 Indices of sugar and average food prices, January 2008 to August 2009&nbsp;</strong><strong>(January 2008 = 100)<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ef25c2f4d861afe325f4a85ed63795e7" alt="" width="429" height="319"><br><br>Sources: International Sugar Organisation: The Economist<br></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One explanation of the world sugar price rise was the weather. 2009 proved particularly unfavourable in major&nbsp;producing countries, with drought in India, too much rain in Brazil and hailstorms in Russia. Another explanation&nbsp;offered was motorists' increased use of ethanol as a car fuel. One way to produce ethanol is by&nbsp;using sugar cane as a raw material.<br>Sugar prices in individual economies changed in a variety of ways. In 2008 sugar prices in India fell partly&nbsp;because the Indian Government banned sugar exports. In response to this price fall, Indian farmers planted&nbsp;less sugar cane.<br>Malaysia was affected by rising sugar prices but mainly as a consumer. The Malaysian Government set a&nbsp;maximum price of 1.45 ringgit per kilogram. Tesco hypermarkets in Malaysia reacted to this price by rationing&nbsp;customers to 2 kilograms per customer. On the black market in Malaysia sugar was sold at 1.70 ringgit per&nbsp;kilogram, while it fetched 2.90 ringgit in neighbouring Thailand.</p>

<li>Price index of 200 represents 23 US cents<br>Therefore price index of 100 represents (23/200)&nbsp;× 100 = 11.5&nbsp;US cents.</li>
<li>For the first six months both fluctuated somewhat in the same pattern and reached the same level in&nbsp;July 2008. However, after July 08 sugar price shows an increasing trend whereas average food price&nbsp;fell. Overall sugar price almost doubled over the period while food price fell though just by a fraction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Sugarcane, being an agricultural product, is immensely dependent on the weather condition. Thus unfavourable&nbsp;weather conditions could result in a fall in total output of sugarcane and hence sugar. The effect is shown&nbsp;in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9b4fb779e1c313b99dba463d4870fe8e" alt="" width="668" height="514"><br><br>Fall in supply of sugar is indicated by a leftward shift in the supply curve. This causes shortage at P<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;leading to a rise in price but a fall in quantity traded.<br>On the other hand, increasing use of ethanol as fuel in cars extracted from sugarcane has led to an increase&nbsp;in demand for sugarcane. The effect on the market is shown in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/aab1daf5cd6354f2fe4a54fe9000e09a" alt="" width="332" height="264"><br>Rise in demand for sugarcane is indicated by a rightward shift in the demand curve. This causes shortage&nbsp;at P<sub>1</sub> leading to a rise in both price and quantity traded.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Overall the continuing rapid increase in the price of sugar is likely to induce the consumers to reduce&nbsp;their quantity demanded at least in the short run. For people who have developed the habit of using&nbsp;food items with sugar as ingredient of taste will find it difficult to curtail their consumption , therefore,&nbsp;proportionate decrease in QD will be less than the rise in price. However the consumers not addicted&nbsp;to sugar would be able to change their consumption pattern.</li>
<li>Producers, on the other hand, will be encouraged to increase their output and sales of sugar as continuing&nbsp;rise in price will increase their profits.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The Indian government banned export of sugar because the higher world price would have increased&nbsp;the amount exported and reduced the availability of sugar to the home market. Thus ban would help&nbsp;lower income families, in particular, because it would ensure sufficient quantity of sugar available at&nbsp;relatively low price.<br>Additionally, the decision by the Indian authorities could lead to retaliatory measures, particularly from&nbsp;the major trading partners. They may resort to the similar policy towards India and could ban their&nbsp;exports of essential products to India or else they may decide to limit imports of other products from&nbsp;India.<br>What is more, the Indian exporters may lose their market to other competitors which might prove&nbsp;to be difficult to regain in future. India is likely to suffer from a loss of earnings from its potential&nbsp;exports. This is likely to reduce the inflow of foreign currency which will put a strain on Indian balance&nbsp;of trade and foreign exchange value.</li>
<li>Maximum price below the free market equilibrium price, is said to be binding or effective. The effects&nbsp;of maximum price on sugar are illustrated by the figure below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ccb6ded404d3d6826a62221582f5aa6c" alt="" width="337" height="224"><br><br>Malysian government fixes a maximum at 1.45 ringgit, at this lower price, sugar producers, particularly&nbsp;those with higher costs, will supply less, and supply will be Q<sub>2</sub>. Consumers, on the other hand, will&nbsp;demand more at this low price; they would like to purchase the quantity Q<sub>2</sub>. So a shortage q<sub>2</sub> - q<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>develops.<br>As a consequence consumers who can purchase sugar at a lower price are clearly better off, but those&nbsp;who have been rationed out and cannot buy sugar due to the shortage are worse off. In this situation&nbsp;some other method of allocation must be adopted. Sellers, for instance, sellers will sell their available&nbsp;supplies on a "first come, first served" basis. Long queues will develop, and allocation will be on the&nbsp;basis of luck.&nbsp; Alternatively sellers may keep products under the counter and sell only on the basis&nbsp;of favoritism.&nbsp; A major consequence is the emergence of black markets. Consequently, the government&nbsp;is required to adopt a system of rationing because an unregulated shortage leads to an inequitable&nbsp;(unfair) distribution of the product.</li>

<li>Terms of trade are measured by the ratio of the price&nbsp;of exports to the price of imports. In the real world&nbsp;international trade involves many countries and numerous&nbsp;products, therefore, a country's terms of trade are&nbsp;computed as an index number:<br>TOT = (index of export prices)/(index of import prices)&nbsp;× 100<br>A rise in the index is referred to as an improvement in&nbsp;a country's terms of trade. It means more can be imported&nbsp;per unit of goods exported than previously. If,&nbsp;for instance, export price index rises from 100 to 120&nbsp;while the import price index rises from 100 to 110 the&nbsp;terms trade index rises from 100 to 109. At the new&nbsp;TOT, a unit of exports will buy 9 percent more imports&nbsp;than at the old terms.<br>Thus the improvement in TOT is the outcome of the&nbsp;movement of export and import price indices. In our&nbsp;example export prices have increased more than the&nbsp;import prices and the result is improvement in TOT.&nbsp;Same result can be obtained by several different sets of&nbsp;changes in price indices of both exports and imports.&nbsp;When, for instance, export prices fall less than the import&nbsp;prices or export prices rise whereas import prices remain&nbsp;unchanged or else export prices remain unchanged&nbsp;but import prices fall, there will be an improvement in&nbsp;a countrys terms of trade.<br>So what causes change in prices of imports and exports?&nbsp;Several factors can be pointed out as determinants of&nbsp;export and import prices.<br>The most important of them are demand and supply of&nbsp;exports and imports and their relative price elasticities.&nbsp;A rising demand for the country's exports in the international&nbsp;market is likely to increase the price of its exports&nbsp;and hence can improvement its TOT. Similarly if in the&nbsp;world market there is an increase in supply of the goods&nbsp;that the country imports the prices of imports are likely&nbsp;to decrease and therefore will produce the same result.&nbsp;On the other hand, a decrease in price elasticity of&nbsp;exports and an increase in price elasticity of imports&nbsp;will place the country in a better bargaining position&nbsp;which if the country makes use of will improve its TOT.<br>Changes in exchange rate also influence prices of exports&nbsp;and imports. An appreciation in the country's currency&nbsp;reduces the prices of imports in local currency and increases&nbsp;the prices of exports in foreign currency thus&nbsp;results in improvement in TOT.<br>A country's rate of inflation also has bearing on its TOT.&nbsp;A relatively higher inflation rate, for instance, will increase&nbsp;the prices of exports more than the prices of&nbsp;imports resulting in improvement in TOT.<br>Also protectionist measures such as increase in tariff on&nbsp;imports can force other countries to lower their prices&nbsp;of exports by the amount of tariff so that their sales&nbsp;remain unaffected. Similarly, other countries providing&nbsp;subsidies to the export related industries will benefit the&nbsp;country importing goods from them because the prices&nbsp;paid for imports after subsidy will be lower.</li>
<li>Primarily the terms of trade ratio measures the amount&nbsp;of imports that can be obtained per unit of goods exported.&nbsp;Thus a fall in the index of a country's terms of&nbsp;trade, also known as unfavourable movement, is attributed&nbsp;to decreasing prices of its exports or increasing&nbsp;prices of its imports or both. It means that the country&nbsp;can import less in return for any given amount of exports&nbsp;or else it must export more to pay for any given&nbsp;amount of imports.<br>This will, of course, reduce the international purchasing&nbsp;power of a country; however, it may benefit or harm&nbsp;the country in many different ways.<br>A fall in terms of trade may have a detrimental effect&nbsp;on trade in goods and employment in the country. The&nbsp;reason for this is that a fall in relative prices of exports&nbsp;may, depending on the price elasticity of demand, lead&nbsp;to a rise in total value of exports sales, whereas an&nbsp;increase in prices of imports will make them relatively&nbsp;unattractive and so the total value of imports may&nbsp;decline. In both cases trade balance will improve and&nbsp;employment may rise. However when international&nbsp;demand for the country's exports is price inelastic, the&nbsp;given fall in prices of exports will generate a proportionately&nbsp;smaller rise in its quantity exported thus results&nbsp;in a fall in export earnings and worsening of trade balance.&nbsp;Similarly if worsening of a country's terms of trade&nbsp;is due to rise in prices of its imports and demand for&nbsp;imports is price inelastic the rise in price will have a&nbsp;bigger effect on its import bill i.e. trade balance is likely&nbsp;to worsen. In this case if the country is an importer of&nbsp;raw material or food items then rising prices of its&nbsp;imports will fuel inflation and reduce the level of employment.<br>Deflation is defined as a period when the general price&nbsp;level falls. It is normally associated with falling level of&nbsp;AD leading to a negative output gap where actual GDP&nbsp;falls short of potential GDP.<br>Thus deflation is an indicator of a decline in the level&nbsp;of economic activity. In a recession, as the term implies,&nbsp;aggregate demand decreases driving the price level down.&nbsp;As a result firms are forced to revise down their investment&nbsp;and production plans. Decline in output is accompanied&nbsp;by increasing unemployment. As employment&nbsp;falls, so do households incomes; falling incomes cause&nbsp;demand to fall further. Prices and hence profits drop and&nbsp;many firms make losses. The situation looks bleak and&nbsp;businesses and households lose confidence, resulting in&nbsp;a decline in all types of spending resulting in the level&nbsp;of economic activities to decrease. The real value of&nbsp;household, corporate and government debt rises when&nbsp;the price level is falling- another factor that might cause&nbsp;people to cut back on their spending. Falling asset prices&nbsp;such as price deflation in the housing market hit personal&nbsp;sector financial wealth and confidence - leading to&nbsp;further declines in AD and a rise in precautionary savings.<br>However deflation is not necessarily bad. If falling prices&nbsp;are caused by higher productivity then it can go hand&nbsp;in hand with robust growth. Deflation may also benefit&nbsp;a country in terms of improvement in trade balance because&nbsp;it increases cost competitiveness of exports and&nbsp;is likely to reduce the level of imports. Neverthless, the&nbsp;improvement in trade balance is subject to price elasticity&nbsp;of exports and income elasticity of demand for&nbsp;imports. On the other hand, if deflation reflects a slump&nbsp;in demand and excess capacity, it can be dangerous.<br>The above discussion suggests that the negative impact&nbsp;of deflation is more extensive and harmful than the impact&nbsp;of worsening of terms of trade. Also many countries&nbsp;have economically thrived despite a worsening of their&nbsp;terms of trade and have been able to cope with it by&nbsp;implementing appropriate policies. While coping with&nbsp;deflation is relatively more complicated and requires a&nbsp;more dynamic set of policies.</li>

Thus, the working of the market is&nbsp;based solely upon the price system, whereby consumers,&nbsp;indicate their wishes to producers and the prices&nbsp;reflect the relative level of scarcity. Although, this system&nbsp;proves to be efficient in many ways, but in case&nbsp;of healthcare such an arrangement leads to an inefficient&nbsp;allocation of resources i.e. a market failure that justifies&nbsp;some form of government intervention. It is for this&nbsp;reason that in most economies healthcare is provided&nbsp;both by the public and private sector.</p>
<p>Healthcare can be classified as a private good because&nbsp;the principles of exclusion and rivalry can be applied.&nbsp;Exclusion simply implies that anyone who does not pay&nbsp;for the services can be excluded from enjoying their benefits.&nbsp;If, for instance, a patient is unable or unwilling to&nbsp;pay the cost of a treatment he will not be served. Principle&nbsp;of rivalry means that if a surgeon is operating a&nbsp;patient other patients cannot benefit from his services at&nbsp;the same time. The patients are rivals for this resource;&nbsp;the amount of sergeon's time is scarce. Surgeon's services&nbsp;are therefore priced according to our levels of demand and&nbsp;supply of his time. There is therefore nothing inherent in&nbsp;healthcare that makes it different from private goods.&nbsp;Healthcare services, therefore, can be supplied through&nbsp;the market and in many countries they actually are.</p>
<p>Provision of healthcare by the private sector involves&nbsp;several good things. Competition among the service providers&nbsp;results in improved services and the most efficient&nbsp;use of scarce resources. Consumers benefit from&nbsp;the choice available to them in terms of different service&nbsp;providers and enjoy better conditions in terms of shorter&nbsp;waiting times. However, the profit motive implies that&nbsp;the services are provided on the basis of ability to pay&nbsp;rather than on need basis. This limits the availability of&nbsp;the healthcare and is considered inequitable.</p>
<p>The real problem arises when society deems healthcare&nbsp;as a merit good. A merit good is better for the consumer&nbsp;than the consumer perceives. In addition to this a merit&nbsp;good is associated with positive externalities. Thus the&nbsp;essence of merit good is to do with a failure of information&nbsp;to the consumer and spillover effects on nonconsumers.&nbsp;Consider the example of vaccination against&nbsp;influenza where quite often people do not appreciate&nbsp;how good inoculation is for them. In other words they&nbsp;do not perceive its full benefits at the time of making&nbsp;decision. It, therefore, results in insufficient demand being&nbsp;registered in the market. This is illustrated in the graph&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/af06acd1619877795b396d944e2232e5" alt="" width="460" height="340"></p>
<p>Curve D<sub>1</sub> indicates the level of demand when consumers&nbsp;have all relevant information for decision making.&nbsp;However the demand registered in the market is shown&nbsp;by the curve D. Thus the market forces would provide&nbsp;oq amount only whereas oq<sub>1</sub> is the socially optimum&nbsp;quantity. Also an inoculation might be seen as a merit&nbsp;good as others who may not catch the disease from the&nbsp;inoculated person also benefit.</p>
<p>Although, consumer valuation of healthcare can be&nbsp;corrected with awareness campaigns, they do not always&nbsp;prove to be effective and regulatory authorities&nbsp;resort to measures such as financial intervention, compulsory&nbsp;consumption and free provision. Therefore, left&nbsp;alone to consumer wishes, free market system is prone&nbsp;to failure in case of healthcare.</p>
<p>In conclusion, since healthcare is classified as a private&nbsp;good, economic agents find reason to sell it in the free&nbsp;market. Therefore, healthcare can most certainly, be&nbsp;supplied by the free market. However, economists will&nbsp;consider the combined welfare of the whole society when&nbsp;making a decision on whether healthcare should be provided&nbsp;as such. But the nature of healthcare as a merit will&nbsp;lead to under-production and under-consumption. Therefore,&nbsp;economists would not favour the provision of healthcare only by the free market. However, the type and&nbsp;degree of government intervention will differ according to&nbsp;the needs and capacity of the economy in question.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 177</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8900</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the influences which determine the level of demand for healthcare in an economy.

at&nbsp;various prices in a given period of time, ceteris paribus.&nbsp;Thus, demand for a product is different from the quantity&nbsp;demanded. While quantity demanded is a function&nbsp;of price - and hence, changes inversely with the price&nbsp;of the same product, ceteris paribus, demand, is influenced&nbsp;by the factors other than price of the same product.&nbsp;So, a change in quantity demanded is shown as a&nbsp;movement along the demand curve, whereas a change in&nbsp;demand is shown as a shift in the demand curve as&nbsp;illustrated in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/296097c784bc3ed51e26d1a7546d45ca" alt="" width="303" height="205"><br><br>In an economy the demand for health care will change&nbsp;due to a change in general level of money incomes. Health&nbsp;care is normally regarded as a normal good, therefore, a&nbsp;rise in money incomes in general will allow people to&nbsp;spend more and hence demand is likely to increase. On&nbsp;the contrary, in recession people spending and hence&nbsp;demand for health care is likely decrease.<br>To a great degree, the level of demand for health care&nbsp;will also depend upon the state of mind of the consumers.&nbsp;This is where, government intervention comes into&nbsp;play. If the government chooses to create awareness in&nbsp;society, demand for health care would tend to be much&nbsp;higher than otherwise. Also, demand rises when government&nbsp;enacts legislation regarding making it compulsory&nbsp;for certain medical procedures to be followed, for example,&nbsp;all those who leave from Pakistan on pilgrimage&nbsp;to Saudi Arabia are coerced to take vaccination from&nbsp;certain illnesses.<br>Demand for health care also depends on medical awareness&nbsp;in society related to medical advancement. Therefore,&nbsp;as time moves on, and medical science progresses,&nbsp;there will be greater demand for certain departments of&nbsp;health care, unknown before.<br>As one would expect, demand for health care is bound&nbsp;to be different throughout the year, as changing seasons,&nbsp;and the characteristics of weather impose various conditions&nbsp;to favour or restrain ailments. Also, certain&nbsp;epidemics, such as the dengue flu which struck Pakistan&nbsp;recently, dramatically changed the number of "buyers"&nbsp;of health care. Furthermore, over long periods of time,&nbsp;pollution and climate change inflict unfavourable conditions&nbsp;for health resulting in an increase in demand. This&nbsp;factor is, of course, more rampant in the industrially&nbsp;advanced countries. It also, however, depends upon&nbsp;geographical positioning of a country: for example, the&nbsp;devastating floods that hit Pakistan recently, as a result&nbsp;of climate change, altered the regional pattern of the&nbsp;monsoon season. In turn, the floods gave rise to the&nbsp;demand for health care.<br>In an economy, a change in the size or structure of population&nbsp;potentially determines the level of demand for&nbsp;health care. A rising population induces higher demand&nbsp;while a decreasing size of population means less number&nbsp;of buyers. Similarly the rising proportion of aging population&nbsp;or children necessitate buying of health care services,&nbsp;demand, therefore, is expected to increase.<br>In conclusion, the demand for health care in an economy&nbsp;depends upon the determinants of demand for all goods.&nbsp;However, owing to its nature as a merit good and the&nbsp;fragility of human health, influences within those determinants&nbsp;are far more numerous and complicated than&nbsp;with most goods.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 178</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8899</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the combination of improved technology&nbsp;and globalisation will result in solving the basic&nbsp;economic problem.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The term 'scarcity' describes that at any point of time&nbsp;there is finite amount of resources available to satisfy&nbsp;infinite wants. Owing to scarcity all societies have to&nbsp;make choices and the process of making choices involve&nbsp;sacrifice measured as opportunity cost. It is important&nbsp;to distinguish scarcity from poverty. Scarcity occurs&nbsp;among poor as well as rich people. It applies to all&nbsp;because there will never be enough of everything that&nbsp;people want at zero price. Even the richest person on&nbsp;earth will still have unfulfilled wants.<br>Improvement in technology entails progress in knowledge&nbsp;about techniques of production. Such progress may&nbsp;allow more output to be obtained from the same amount&nbsp;of resources. While globalization is the process by which&nbsp;the whole world becomes a single market. This means&nbsp;that goods and services, capital and labour are traded on&nbsp;a worldwide basis. Another way of describing&nbsp;globalisation is to describe it as a process of making the&nbsp;world economy more interdependent. The expansion of&nbsp;trade in goods and services, the huge increase in flows&nbsp;of financial capital across national boundaries and the&nbsp;significant increase in multinational economic activity&nbsp;means that most of the world's economies are increasingly&nbsp;dependent on each other for their economic health.&nbsp;Globalization no longer necessarily requires a business&nbsp;to own a physical presence in terms of either owning&nbsp;production plants or land in other countries, or even&nbsp;exports and imports. For instance, economic activity&nbsp;can be shifted abroad by the processes of licensing and&nbsp;franchising which only needs information and finance to&nbsp;cross borders.<br>The process of globalization has been aided largely by&nbsp;the phenomenal technological progress particularly in&nbsp;the area of transportation and communication. Technological&nbsp;progress has reduced massively the cost of transmitting&nbsp;and communicating information - sometimes&nbsp;known as "the death of distance" - this is an enormous&nbsp;factor behind the growth of trade in knowledge products&nbsp;using internet technology. Advances in transport technology&nbsp;have lowered the costs, increased the speed and&nbsp;reliability of transporting goods and people - extending&nbsp;the geographical reach of firms by making new and&nbsp;growing markets accessible on a cost-effective basis. As&nbsp;a result, there has been a significant increase in the number&nbsp;of firms that locate, source and sell internationally, reflecting&nbsp;the new opportunities presented by the ICT&nbsp;revolution.<br>For consumers and capitalists, the rapid expansion of&nbsp;international trade and foreign investment is normally&nbsp;considered a good thing. The ease with which goods,&nbsp;capital and technical knowledge can be moved around&nbsp;the world has increasingly enabled the division of labour&nbsp;on a global scale, as firms allocate their operations in&nbsp;line with countries' comparative advantage. It means that&nbsp;the nations concentrate on producing what they can do&nbsp;best rather than relying on self sufficiency. It also results&nbsp;in nations producing surplus beyond their needs.&nbsp;Surplus products can then be exchanged and traded with&nbsp;the potential for gains in welfare for all parties.<br>Economic theory suggests that increased competition&nbsp;from overseas leads to improvements in efficiency and&nbsp;gains in economic welfare. Vigorous trade makes for more&nbsp;choice for consumers, greater spending, rising living&nbsp;standards and a growth in international travel.<br>However concern has been expressed in some quarters&nbsp;that economic activity and employment in some economies&nbsp;drain away to the others. Inevitably some jobs are&nbsp;lost as firms switch their production to countries with&nbsp;lower unit labour costs. But the theory of international&nbsp;trade and most past experiences suggest that all nations&nbsp;in the globalization process will gain in the long run -&nbsp;as trade is an important determinant of long run growth&nbsp;and rising living standards. Critics of globalisation in&nbsp;some developed countries point to the risks of increasing&nbsp;income equalities and greater job insecurity together&nbsp;with the threat of structural unemployment in industries&nbsp;where demand for labour falls.<br>While no one will dispute the fact that technological&nbsp;progress coupled with globalization will increase the&nbsp;world output from the available resources and as a result&nbsp;much more than ever will be available to consume which&nbsp;is likely to improve standard of living for majority if not&nbsp;for all. Yet the world, at any point in time, will never&nbsp;be able to produce enough to satisfy all wants of all the&nbsp;people living in the world.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 179</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8897</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Show how production possibility curves may be used&nbsp;to explain any two economic ideas.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A production possibility curve (PPC) shows all possible&nbsp;combinations of two goods that a country can&nbsp;produce within a specified time period when all its&nbsp;resources fully and efficiently employed with the given&nbsp;state of technology. The idea of production possibilities&nbsp;is usually shown graphically as given below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/cbf04eb6e1e2b4e7596032759bc26e6b" alt="" width="254" height="235"><br><br>In the graph above each point on the PPC represents&nbsp;maximum output of capital goods and consumer goods.&nbsp;The country must achieve full employment and productive&nbsp;efficiency in order to operate at any point on the&nbsp;PPC. However, if the economy were at point G, there&nbsp;would be unemployed resources and by bringing those&nbsp;resources into use the economy could move to any point&nbsp;on the PPC. Points outside the frontier such as H are&nbsp;unattainable with the current supplies of resources and&nbsp;technology.<br>However, any change in the quantity or productivity of&nbsp;resources will shift the PPC either outward or inward.&nbsp;An outward shift represents growth while an inward&nbsp;shift reflects a decline in the capacity output of an&nbsp;economy. Thus employment, the level of total output&nbsp;and growth can be analyzed on a country's PPC.</p>
<p>Primarily the negative slope of the PPC can be viewed&nbsp;in terms of scarcity of resources and opportunity cost.&nbsp;The term scarcity indicates the excess of human wants&nbsp;over what can actually be produced to fulfill these wants.&nbsp;In the graph above the maximum output of either capital&nbsp;goods or consumer goods is restricted to 30 and 25 million&nbsp;units respectively. Alternatively, a number of combinations&nbsp;of the two products, of course within the given&nbsp;range, are attainable. However as we move along the&nbsp;PPC, owing to the limited availability of resources, more&nbsp;of a good can be produced only by giving up a certain&nbsp;quantity of the other. So, because the productive resources&nbsp;are scarce, therefore the output itself is limited&nbsp;and society is not able to produce and consume both&nbsp;these goods more in quantities than what are reflected&nbsp;by its PPC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the concept of scarcity implies that the&nbsp;economy cannot have unlimited output of goods and&nbsp;services even by employing all its resources fully and&nbsp;efficiently, therefore, society must choose which goods&nbsp;and services to produce and in what quantities and which&nbsp;to forgo. To be precise a PPC shows that obtaining&nbsp;more of one type of output requires having less of the&nbsp;other. Thus PPC also illustrates opportunity costs&nbsp;because more units of consumer goods needs resources&nbsp;to be taken from the production of capital goods, i.e.&nbsp;there is an alternative forgone. In our example at point&nbsp;A the opportunity cost of 30 million units of consumer&nbsp;goods involves 25 million units of capital goods sacrificed.&nbsp;A movement from A to B involving the production&nbsp;of 5 million units of capital goods requires a reduction&nbsp;of 2 million units in the production of consumer goods&nbsp;with an opportunity cost of 0.4 ( one unit of capital has&nbsp;been gained at the expense of 0.4 units of consumer&nbsp;goods).</p>
<p>Thus, the inevitable issue of scarcity generates a downward&nbsp;sloping PPC reflecting opportunity cost of one&nbsp;good in terms of another. The curve and hence the&nbsp;opportunity cost would not have existed if resources&nbsp;were not scarce.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 180</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8895</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>The price of rice in international trade</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Between January 2002 and July 2008 the world price of rice, a staple food for many people in developing&nbsp;countries, rose by slightly over 300%. As shown in</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fig. 1 the price of rice changed very significantly in&nbsp;the six months to July 2008 and was influenced by the actions of different governments.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0e0a07155a0d19a9b92125521a3c8ee3" alt="" width="527" height="321"><br><br>The rise in the price of rice was typical of a wide range of commodities. These price rises caused food and&nbsp;fuel riots in developing countries. As a result some governments turned to protectionist trade measures.&nbsp;Vietnam limited rice exports while Cambodia and Egypt banned all rice exports.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Indian Government replaced the minimum export price that it enforced for non-basmati rice with a&nbsp;complete ban on rice exports. At the same time it placed restrictions on wheat imports for the purpose of&nbsp;disease control.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="text-align: left;">How might an effective minimum price for exports have helped India's position?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Why might India have changed from the use of a minimum export price to an export ban?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Discuss the potentially harmful effects of India's protectionist trade policy for both its own economy&nbsp;and that of the rest of the world.</li>

<li>From figure, price of rice in July 2008 = $780 per tonne approximately.<br>Let x be the approximate world price of rice in January 2002 and let the price has risen by 300%<br>⇒ x + (300/100)x = $780<br>⇒ 4x = $780<br>⇒ x = 195<br>Therefore, the approximate price of rice in January 2002 = $195 per tonne.</li>
<li>In the middle of Nov.07, price of rice in the world market was just under $400 per metric ton. At this&nbsp;point India, one of the major rice exporters, placed a complete ban on its rice exports. It reduced the world&nbsp;supply of rice resulting in a rise in world price up to approximately $400. In Jan. 08 Vietnam too restricted&nbsp;its exports of rice which proved even a bigger supply shock. Consequently, the world price rose to $1000&nbsp;until Japan announced a release in stocks in May 08, which led to a rise in supply and a fall in price to&nbsp;the level just below $800 at the end of July 08.</li>
<li>Indian authorities might have anticipated a possible fall in supply of rice in the world market foliowed&nbsp;by an increase in international price. So they decided to place a ban on rice exports because the higher&nbsp;world price would have increased the amount exported and reduced the availability of rice to the home&nbsp;market. If India had exported rice in excess of what they needed for domestic consumption it would have&nbsp;fuelled inflation as rice is an important part of their daily diet. It, therefore, takes a significantly large&nbsp;proportion of total expenditure of an average Indian family. Additionally, ban would help lower income&nbsp;families because it would ensure sufficient quantity of a staple food item available at relatively low price.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Minimum price set above the world price would have proved effective and therefore, have helped&nbsp;India's position. Consider the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4134d1d60dd59b37e69f837b525c8049" alt="" width="346" height="236"><br><br>World price P<sub>w</sub> is below the minimum price P<sub>min</sub> in India. With no minimum price quantity exported&nbsp;would have been q<sub>2</sub> - q<sub>3</sub>. A minimum price P<sub>min</sub> higher than the P<sub>w</sub> will make export of rice unattractive.&nbsp;This would reduce the amount exported and increase the availability of rice to the home market.</li>
<li>Firstly the minimum price set by the Indian government might have been at a level below the world&nbsp;price or else the authorities might have anticipated the world price to rise a level above the minimum&nbsp;price. Either way the minimum price would have been ineffective. Secondly, due to the price inelastic&nbsp;demand for rice, even with the rising world price there might not have been a significant decrease in&nbsp;world demand and hence Indian exports.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The term 'protectionism' refers to a policy of restriction on international trade with the objective of preventing&nbsp;unemployment or losses in industries threatened by imports and affecting the availability of certain products&nbsp;to the domestic consumers etc. The protectionist measures range from tariff, quota, subsidy, to&nbsp;a complete ban on imports or exports.<br><br>The decision by the Indian authorities to ban their exports of rice to the world may have several implications&nbsp;on the Indian economy and to the rest of the world. As a retaliatory measure, particularly the major&nbsp;trading partners may resort to the similar policy towards India where they ban their exports of essential&nbsp;products to India or else they may decide to limit imports of other products from India. Thus any gain&nbsp;of the policy to India will be offset by a loss in terms of reduced trade with the rest of the world. In&nbsp;the end, everyone loses.<br><br>What is more, the Indian exporters may lose their market to other competitors which might prove to be&nbsp;difficult to regain in future. The world will be deprived of low cost imports from India and therefore will&nbsp;have to import same product from high cost countries resulting in welfare loss. India is likely to suffer&nbsp;from a loss of earnings from its potential exports. This is likely to reduce the inflow of foreign currency&nbsp;which will put a strain on Indian BOP and foreign exchange value.</li>

<li>Inflation is a persistent and generalized increase in the&nbsp;level of prices. The term persistent implies that average&nbsp;of all prices is rising year in and year out.<br>Rate of inflation is not just a matter of academic interest.&nbsp;It forms the basis of a wide range of decisions from&nbsp;wage negotiations, through welfare payments and pensions,&nbsp;to indexation of assets. Thus rate of inflation is&nbsp;of utmost importance for decisions made by consumers,&nbsp;businesses, workers and governments.<br>Consumers plan changes in their consumption and saving&nbsp;pattern according to the movement of rate of Inflation.&nbsp;Businesses keep track of the rate of inflation to&nbsp;predict changes in cost and revenue in order to plan&nbsp;their levels of output. Besides this it is one of the most&nbsp;important factors determining their future investment&nbsp;plans.<br>Workers and trade unions use rate of inflation for wage&nbsp;negotiations as it is an important factor in determining&nbsp;the purchasing power of a given wage rate. Banks and&nbsp;financial houses use this in order to adjust the market&nbsp;values of index-linked financial assets.<br>For government rate of inflation is a central economic&nbsp;target therefore, forms the basis of its policy. More than&nbsp;that success of government economic policy can be&nbsp;judged from the extent to which government achieves its&nbsp;targeted rate of inflation. Part of government spending&nbsp;which is linked to the rate of inflation such as publicsector&nbsp;wages and pensions would be affected a great&nbsp;deal by high and low rate of inflation.<br>So what if the retail price index (RPI) overstates or&nbsp;understates inflation? The problem is, as explained above,&nbsp;that the RPI affects nearly everyone. Government payments&nbsp;to social security receivers are indexed to the RPI;&nbsp;when the RPI rises, social security payments automatically&nbsp;rise in lockstep. If the statistics are inaccurate, the&nbsp;real values of these payments may not be maintained.&nbsp;For instance an overstated rate of inflation would increase&nbsp;pensions and index-linked welfare payments more&nbsp;than the fall in the value of money. This will put additional&nbsp;burden on government and will accelerate the&nbsp;rate of inflation.<br>Also government's estimates of tax revenues may suffer&nbsp;from the overstated rate of inflation, since personal income&nbsp;brackets are ad-justed upward annually to reflect increases&nbsp;in the RPI.<br>Millions of unionized workers have cost-of-living adjustment&nbsp;clauses in their labor contracts; such adjustments&nbsp;are tied to increases in the RPI. Moreover, the&nbsp;wage expectations of nearly all workers are linked to the&nbsp;rate of inflation, as measured by the RPI. Since the RPI&nbsp;is used to calculate real (inflation-adjusted) wages, an&nbsp;understated rate of inflation means that real wages have&nbsp;grown less rapidly than the official statistics suggest,&nbsp;thus resulting in a decline in real wages.<br>When RPI rises, lenders often raise their interest rates&nbsp;on loans to account for inflation. An inaccurate figure of&nbsp;inflation may only worsen the economic situation by&nbsp;inappropriate adjustments in interest rate. Also the&nbsp;nation's economic policy makers base some of their&nbsp;policies on the RPI's rate of change. Inaccurate figure of&nbsp;inflation would result in a lack of trust of the statistics&nbsp;and hence would undermine the acceptance of these&nbsp;policies and their effectiveness.<br>In conclusion an inaccurate measure of inflation would&nbsp;result in an inappropriate direction and level of action&nbsp;leading to a worsening of the economic situation.</li>
<li>Inflation is measured by changes in the retail price index&nbsp;(RPI) which records changes in the general level of prices&nbsp;paid by consumers for selected goods and services.&nbsp;Construction of RPI involves the following four stages.&nbsp;Firstly, a base year is selected as a reference point. The&nbsp;year selected as a base must be a normal year in economic&nbsp;terms i.e. any year identified with abnormal economic&nbsp;circumstances due to, say, a natural calamity, war&nbsp;and political instability cannot serve as a point of reference.&nbsp;Secondly, a survey is conducted to find out what&nbsp;families buy and how much they spend on particular&nbsp;items. The findings from the survey help economists to&nbsp;select items and to assign relative weights to individual&nbsp;commodities. Weights are expressed as the amount spent&nbsp;on each item as a fraction of total expenditure.<br>Then comes the third stage of recording how much the&nbsp;prices of selected items have changed, the information&nbsp;is collected from all main retail outlet and from utility&nbsp;providers such as gas, water and transport etc. To&nbsp;construct an example let's assume that the selected items&nbsp;are fuel, milk and meat and the spending ratio is 2:3:4&nbsp;respectively.<br><br>

<br>974.5/9=108.3<br>Once the prices have been recorded, at the fourth and&nbsp;final stage first the price index for each item is calculated.&nbsp;To generate a weighted price index we multiply&nbsp;the price index for each category by its weight. We then&nbsp;add the weighted price index of all the selected items&nbsp;and divide the sum by total weights to find an overall&nbsp;price index.<br>If the RPI in current year is higher than that of base&nbsp;year index, then on average price level has increased. In&nbsp;our example value of RPI in year 1 = 108.3 and that of&nbsp;base year = 100. Hence, the rate of inflation is 8.3%&nbsp;since the base year. An index of below 100 in year 1&nbsp;would indicate a fall in average price level.<br>However the value of RPI may not be an accurate measure&nbsp;of inflation. Economists identified substantial problems&nbsp;involved firstly in the process of construction of RPI&nbsp;and secondly in its application to all different income&nbsp;groups.<br>To begin with, selection of base year is a problem. It&nbsp;is a very delicate affair and the only basis of selection&nbsp;is good judgment. It must not be an abnormal year of&nbsp;very high and low increases in prices because consumer&nbsp;expenditure patterns will differ greatly during recession&nbsp;in comparison to periods of economic stability.<br>Also base year should not be far back from the current&nbsp;year because the further we move away from the base&nbsp;year the more unreal does the basket of goods and&nbsp;services become.<br>Weighting is also a problem because they are based on&nbsp;the spending pattern of the average family but it is&nbsp;difficult to define what this means. Moreover a change&nbsp;in the proportion of consumer spending on different&nbsp;items due to changes in taste, season, income and composition&nbsp;of population requires changes in weights. Also,&nbsp;new goods and services continuously arrive on the&nbsp;markets and some goods and services are no longer in&nbsp;demand. The index must allow for the introduction of&nbsp;new products. Weighting the individual contents has to&nbsp;reflect up to date spending patterns. Failing to do this&nbsp;would make the baskets of goods and the weights assigned&nbsp;incompatible for comparison between the base&nbsp;and current year.<br>The construction of the consumer price index involves&nbsp;a lot of guesswork and this speaks a lot for its inaccuracy.&nbsp;The basket of goods and services is merely an&nbsp;arbitrary sample. Different income groups do not share&nbsp;the same basket of goods. Therefore an index of retail&nbsp;prices can only be used to show variations in the inflation&nbsp;rate for a particular income group, and not at national&nbsp;level. Even people in the same income group do&nbsp;not buy the same commodities in the basket nor have&nbsp;similar proportions. These differences may be due to&nbsp;race, religion, culture and the conditions present in different&nbsp;parts of the country.<br>Finally, it is difficult to measure the inflation rate over&nbsp;time because the quality of goods changes. When the&nbsp;price of a good rises and so does its quality, it can be&nbsp;argued that the value of money did not fall. Therefore&nbsp;there was no inflation but RPI is based on the assumption&nbsp;that the quality of products remains the same over&nbsp;time.<br>Although it is difficult to measure the rate of inflation&nbsp;with utmost precision yet the degree of inaccuracy can&nbsp;be reduced to the minimum by a carefully chosen base&nbsp;year, valid sampling and representative income group.</li>

<p>There is a spectrum of economic systems with the two&nbsp;extremes being pure capitalism and pure command&nbsp;economy. In between is the mixed economy where&nbsp;government owns some of the country's factors of&nbsp;production publicly and some are owned privately.&nbsp;Governments are also required to play a part in influencing&nbsp;the overall level of prices and in attempting to&nbsp;stabilize the economy against extreme fluctuations in&nbsp;income and employment.</p>
<p>Freedom of enterprise exists only in the market part of&nbsp;the economy called the private sector. Thus the private&nbsp;sector will be motivated by self-interest. Firms will&nbsp;maximize profits, consumers will maximise their welfare&nbsp;and the factor owners will maximise rent, interest and&nbsp;profit. On the contrary, in the public sector of the&nbsp;economy, government plans production with the goal of&nbsp;'common good'. The government runs activities, like&nbsp;health care, education public transport etc. Some of these&nbsp;goods and services tend to be provided free at the point&nbsp;of use, although there are some charges for others.</p>
<p>Price mechanism operates freely in the private sector.&nbsp;Through price system consumers indicate their wishes&nbsp;and community's productive resources are allocated accordingly.&nbsp;Also firms keep production costs as low as&nbsp;possible to obtain highest profit margin. So, allocative&nbsp;and productive efficiency will occur. Decisions about&nbsp;what to produce are made by the people who will actually&nbsp;consume the goods.</p>
<p><br>Prices create incentives for households and firms to make&nbsp;decisions in ways consistent with pursuing and achieving&nbsp;the fulfillment of their self-interest. Firms will produce&nbsp;whatever consumers are prepared to buy in order&nbsp;to earn higher profits. They will compete with each&nbsp;other either on price or on a wider range of factors such&nbsp;as quality variation. It is of no surprise, therefore, that&nbsp;there will be a much larger choice of goods and services&nbsp;in a free market part of the economy compared with the&nbsp;public sector. The planner, in the public sector, will be&nbsp;more concerned with making sure there are enough essential&nbsp;goods to go around rather than allocating resources&nbsp;efficiently between all goods.</p>
<p>For markets to operate in an orderly and efficient manner&nbsp;the buyers and sellers in the market must respond to the&nbsp;incentives provided by the price mechanism. Suppose&nbsp;that in a particular market demand rises relative to&nbsp;supply, causing the market price to rise. An immediate&nbsp;result is that the rising price serves to create an incentive&nbsp;for consumers to economize in its use and for firms&nbsp;to shift resources into producing the good. However&nbsp;market forces do not operate freely in the public sector&nbsp;of the economy, therefore the role of incentive, signaling&nbsp;and rationing functions of prices does not exist. Rather&nbsp;prices are determined by the planners with a view to&nbsp;provide goods to everyone.</p>
<p>However price mechanism does not function well in all&nbsp;situations. It will function inefficiently, sometimes&nbsp;breaking down completely or lead-ing to 'market failure',&nbsp;if prices signal wrong or misleading information.&nbsp;Market failures are well-defined situations in which&nbsp;market forces do not work well. Resources such as&nbsp;fishing grounds and common pastureland tend to be&nbsp;overexploited to the point of destruction under freemarket&nbsp;conditions. Some products such as national&nbsp;defense or streetlights, called public goods, are not&nbsp;provided at all by markets because, once produced, no&nbsp;one can be prevented from using them. So their use&nbsp;cannot be restricted to those who are willing to pay for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>In other cases private decision makers impose costs called&nbsp;externalities on those who have no say in the transaction.&nbsp;This is the case when factories pollute the air and&nbsp;rivers. The public is harmed but has no part in the&nbsp;producer's decisions about what to make and how to&nbsp;make it. Since prices set by market forces do not take&nbsp;externalities into account therefore, goods with externalities&nbsp;will be sold at the wrong prices and in the wrong&nbsp;quantities. Similarly there may be a problem with merit&nbsp;goods and demerit goods. Merit goods, like health and&nbsp;education, tend to be under provided whereas demerit&nbsp;goods like cigarettes and alcohol tend to be over provided&nbsp;by price system.</p>
<p>Also, there are important equity issues that arise from&nbsp;letting free markets determine people's incomes. Some&nbsp;people lose their jobs because firms are reorganizing to&nbsp;become more efficient in the face of new technologies.&nbsp;For many reasons of this sort we accept government&nbsp;intervention to redistribute income by taking from the&nbsp;"haves" and giving to the "have-nots."</p>
<p>The discussion above leads us to an important conclusion&nbsp;that the effect of price is more important in the&nbsp;private sector and that it but does not always necessarily&nbsp;work efficiently overall.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 183</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8880</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>With reference to the relevant type of elasticity of&nbsp;demand, explain the terms</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>inferior good, and</li>
<li>complementary good.</li>
</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Elasticity is a numerical measure of responsiveness&nbsp;of a dependent variable to a change in an independent&nbsp;variable. The coefficient of elasticity indicates&nbsp;the % change that will occur in a dependent variable&nbsp;in response to a certain % change in an independent&nbsp;variable.<br><br>Goods are classified as inferior when an increase in&nbsp;consumer's income reduces their demand and vice&nbsp;versa. Since these goods are associated with negative&nbsp;income effect therefore the relevant concept is&nbsp;income elasticity of demand (YED).<br><br>YED is the responsiveness of quantity demanded&nbsp;to a given proportionate change in income alone&nbsp;and is measured by the following:<br>YED = (Proportionate change in quantity demanded)/(Proportionate change in income)<br><br>Negative value of YED reflects an inverse relationship&nbsp;between income and quantity demanded. This&nbsp;means that consumers decrease the purchase of&nbsp;goods, such as public transport and used clothes,&nbsp;as their incomes rise because they then replace them&nbsp;by superior goods such as private transport and&nbsp;new cloths. This relationship is shown in the graph&nbsp;below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8aaa3adc7cf817eab73b94f71da7190e" alt="" width="363" height="175"><br><br>The negative slope of ICC beyond I<sub>2</sub> level of income&nbsp;suggests that the product is considered inferior&nbsp;and hence, YED is negative. It is important to&nbsp;point out that YED of an inferior good can be greater&nbsp;than unity (income elastic) or less than unity (income&nbsp;inelastic), depending on whether the percentage&nbsp;change in the QD is greater or less than the&nbsp;percentage change in income. Thus, negative YED&nbsp;indicates the inverse relationship between income&nbsp;and quantity demanded while the numerical value&nbsp;tells us the strength of that relationship.<br><br></li>
<li>Complements are products that tend to be used&nbsp;jointly i.e. one product enhances satisfaction&nbsp;derived from another. Computer hardware and software&nbsp;are complements; so are CD players and&nbsp;speakers. Because complements tend to be consumed&nbsp;together, a fall in the price of one will increase&nbsp;the demand for the other and vice versa. For&nbsp;instance, if the prices of cell phones in general rise,&nbsp;so that fewer cell phones are bought, the demand&nbsp;for cell phone service will fall. So when two products&nbsp;are complements the price of one and the&nbsp;demand for the other good move in the opposite&nbsp;direction.<br><br>Economists use cross elasticity of demand (XED)&nbsp;to analyze the relationship between complements.<br><br>XED is a numerical measure of the sensitivity of&nbsp;quantity demanded of one product to a change in&nbsp;the price of another. We calculate the coefficient of&nbsp;XED by the following:<br><br>XED = (Percentage change in quantity demanded of product A)/(Percentage change in the price product B)<br><br>The coefficient of XED tells us the % change in the&nbsp;quantity demanded for one good following a certain&nbsp;change in the price of another good. In case of&nbsp;complementary products, there exists an inverse&nbsp;relation between price of one product and demand&nbsp;for the other therefore value of XED is negative.&nbsp;Again it is important to point out that XED of&nbsp;complements can be greater than unity (elastic) or&nbsp;less than unity (inelastic), however, the higher the&nbsp;negative value of XED, the greater the&nbsp;complementarity's between the two goods.</li>

It need not&nbsp;consist of coins and notes. There are examples in the&nbsp;history when salt, cotton cloth and cigarettes have&nbsp;been used as money.<br>Money stimulates trade by making it easier to exchange&nbsp;through its four functions. As a medium of exchange&nbsp;money allows society to escape the complication of&nbsp;double coincidence that requires the need for both sides&nbsp;to want the good the other has to trade. It is cumbersome&nbsp;costly and difficult, if not impossible. Besides this&nbsp;large and bulky goods may be difficult to divide to&nbsp;facilitate exchanges. It, therefore reduces trade volumes&nbsp;and hence the level of specialization. Modern money is&nbsp;denominated in different values thus making it easier to&nbsp;buy and sell goods of different values.<br>As a unit of account money provides a scale to measure&nbsp;the relative worth of a wide variety of commodities,&nbsp;making possible the operation of a price system and&nbsp;automatically providing the basis for keeping accounts,&nbsp;calculating profit and loss etc. It is very difficult under&nbsp;a barter system to establish agreed units of account as&nbsp;people's opinion of the value of certain items differ&nbsp;greatly.<br>Money also functions as a standard of deterred payments,&nbsp;the unit in which, given stability in its value,&nbsp;loans are made and future contracts fixed. Without money,&nbsp;there would be no common basis to allow for dealing in&nbsp;debts. By providing a standard for repayment, money&nbsp;makes borrowing and lending much easier.<br>Finally money acts as a store of wealth, the most convenient&nbsp;way of keeping any income which is surplus to&nbsp;immediate requirements. Because money is also the&nbsp;medium of exchange, wealth stored in this form is completely&nbsp;liquid: it can be converted into other goods&nbsp;immediately and without cost.<br>Division of labour involves the process of production&nbsp;to be broken up into many separate tasks each performed&nbsp;by one person or by a small group of people&nbsp;specializing in performing those particular tasks.<br>Division of labour allows each person to do what he or&nbsp;she can do well while leaving everything else to be done&nbsp;by others. As a result a person who concentrates on one&nbsp;activity becomes better at it than could a jack-of-all-&nbsp;trades. This brings a variety of skills among workers&nbsp;and makes it easier and less costly for firms to train&nbsp;them. More than that it allows firms to benefit from&nbsp;specialist machinery and gain from economizing in the&nbsp;use of tools.<br>Thus specialization and division of labour allows businesses&nbsp;to produce standardized goods on a large scale.&nbsp;The result is higher output, lower per unit cost and&nbsp;improved quality. A higher output at lower costs means&nbsp;economic progress as more wants and needs might be&nbsp;satisfied with a given amount of scarce resources.<br>However in order to fully benefit from division of labour&nbsp;the resulting higher output must be exchanged and traded&nbsp;with the potential for gains in welfare for all parties. In&nbsp;the absence of an effective medium of exchange it would&nbsp;not be possible to trade on such a large scale and gain&nbsp;from specialization and division of labour.<br>It, therefore, follows that division of labour requires an&nbsp;efficient medium of exchange to avoid the cumbersome&nbsp;system of barter. Since money avoids the use of barter&nbsp;and the need for a double coincidence of wants therefore,&nbsp;makes trade more efficient. Acting as a unit of&nbsp;account and a medium of exchange also simplifies the&nbsp;trading process. The store of value and standard of&nbsp;deferred payment functions encourage saving and investment&nbsp;and hence foster efficiency and economic progress.<br>Thus it can be concluded that money has contributed&nbsp;more to economic progress by facilitating trade which&nbsp;led to the possibility of benefiting from division of labour.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 185</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8870</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how microeconomic and macroeconomic issues&nbsp;may be represented using production possibility curves.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Microeconomics looks at specific economic units. It deals&nbsp;with the decision making of individuals and firms, and&nbsp;how a particular market works. Macroeconomics, on&nbsp;the other hand, focuses on the economy as a whole. It&nbsp;is the study of aggregates such as unemployment, inflation,&nbsp;aggregate demand and aggregate supply.<br>A production possibility curve (PPC) shows all possible&nbsp;combinations of two goods that a country can&nbsp;produce within a specified time period with all its resources&nbsp;fully and efficiently employed. The idea of&nbsp;production possibilities is usually shown graphically as&nbsp;given below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/224a1bdfb2ea2a8337de5c741b8d680e" alt="" width="345" height="300"><br><br>Each point on the PPC represents maximum output of&nbsp;capital goods and consumer goods. The country must&nbsp;achieve full employment and productive efficiency in&nbsp;order to operate at any point on the PPC. However, if&nbsp;the economy were at point G, there would be unemployed&nbsp;resources and by bringing those resources into&nbsp;use the economy could move to any point on the PPC.&nbsp;Points outside the frontier such as H are unattainable&nbsp;with the current supplies of resources and technology.&nbsp;However, any change in the quantity or productivity of&nbsp;resources will shift the PPC either outward or inward.&nbsp;An outward shift represents growth while an inward&nbsp;shift reflects a decline in the capacity output of an&nbsp;economy.<br>Thus employment, the level of total output and growth&nbsp;can be analyzed on a country's PPC and all of them are&nbsp;macro economic issues.<br>On the other hand the negative slope of the PPC can&nbsp;be viewed in terms of scarcity of resources and opportunity&nbsp;cost. Since resources are scarce and economy cannot&nbsp;have unlimited output of goods and services even&nbsp;by employing all its resources fully and efficiently,&nbsp;therefore, society must choose which goods and services&nbsp;to produce and in what quantities and which to&nbsp;forgo. To be precise a PPC shows that obtaining more&nbsp;of one type of output requires having less of the other.&nbsp;These issues are related to microeconomics and can be&nbsp;illustrated by a production possibilities model.<br>Some issues such as efficiency or output can be shown&nbsp;either for an economy or a particular sector of an economy.&nbsp;So these issues are subject of both microeconomics and macroeconomics.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 186</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8867</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Current Account of Swaziland's Balance of Payments</strong></p>

<p>The Central Bank of Swaziland's report on the 2007 export performance identified the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exports grew by 8.4% with a positive performance by some manufacturing companies.</li>
<li>Successful exports included sugar, sugar-based products, soft drink concentrates, wood pulp and&nbsp;timber products, textiles and garments, citrus and canned fruits and meat products.</li>
<li>Global demand and rising export prices led to increased export revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Export performance was helped by the depreciation of the domestic currency against the US$ and the&nbsp;currencies of other trading partners outside of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and Common&nbsp;Monetary Area (CMA), of which Swaziland is a member. In addition, exports of meat and meat products&nbsp;to the European Union (EU) resumed in 2007 after the EU lifted its ban on Swaziland's beef exports. This&nbsp;ban was originally imposed because of Swaziland's failure to comply with the required quality standards.</p>

<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Service account improved continuously</li>
<li>Trade in goods showed a continuous worsening</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A current account surplus of $686.7 millions was recorded in the year 2003. Then it worsened and a deficit&nbsp;of $652.7 and $461.8 millions was registered in 2005 and 2007 respectively. Overall current account balance&nbsp;moved from surplus to deficit between 2003 and 2007.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>A country is said to have comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower opportunity&nbsp;cost than another country. This would reflect the country's factors endowment.</li>
<li>Main exports of Swaziland consist of basic and processed agricultural products such as sugar, timber,&nbsp;fruit and meat. In addition to this Swaziland exports basic manufactured products such as textiles and&nbsp;garments.<br>International trade theory predicts that countries have comparative advantage in the production of&nbsp;goods that use intensively the factors of production with which they are abundantly endowed. Thus&nbsp;the abundance of fertile land and suitable climatic conditions such as sunshine, rainfall and temperature&nbsp;are the basis for exports of agricultural products. Availability of relatively inexpensive skilled labour&nbsp;and relevant technology might be the basis for basic manufactured products such as textiles and&nbsp;garments.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Depreciation of a country's currency causes prices of the country's products to fall in foreign currency&nbsp;and hence is expected to increase demand for country's exports. However, depreciation would increase&nbsp;export revenue if the country can possibly produce and supply a larger quantity and also the price elasticity&nbsp;of demand for its exports is relatively elastic. Elastic demand for exports entails that a fall in export prices&nbsp;would result in a proportionately larger increase in quantity demanded. This outcome would not hold if&nbsp;trading partners adopt protectionist measures in order to restrict their imports or else there is a parallel&nbsp;depreciation of their currencies.</li>
<li>Tariff is a tax applied on imports and is designed primarily to raise the prices of foreign goods. Tariff by&nbsp;Swaziland on imports from EU is likely to increase prices. These higher prices would reduce consumption&nbsp;and in particular, would encourage the domestic firms to increase their output. It will particularly allow&nbsp;the industries in their infancy to expand and become more efficient.<br>Both a fall in consumption and increase in domestic production would reduce imports and thus would&nbsp;improve balance of trade and increase employment, at least in the short run. The Swaziland government&nbsp;would also receive extra revenue from the tariff payments. These revenues can be used, for example, to&nbsp;reduce taxes. Finally, tariff on EU goods would also exert pressure on EU to remove ban on import of&nbsp;beef from Swaziland.<br>However, tariff would impose a cost on society. Consumers will have to pay a higher price, and hence&nbsp;consumer surplus will fall. Part of the lost consumer surplus would be redistributed as a benefit to other&nbsp;sections in society. But part of this cost, not recouped, would inflict a net cost on society.<br>A further complication may arise if EU responds strongly by imposing a parallel tariff on imports of other&nbsp;products from Swaziland thus eroding any gain to Swaziland firms exporting their products to EU. This&nbsp;increased use of tariffs may also lead to a trade war consequently reducing trade and limiting growth of&nbsp;Swaziland economy particularly, if EU is an important trading partner.</li>

In real world the&nbsp;TOT are represented as an index of the ratio of export&nbsp;prices and import prices:</p>
<p>TOT= (Index of export prices)/(Index of imports prices)&nbsp;× 100</p>
<p>The ratio is calculated from the average prices of many&nbsp;thousands of goods which are traded with the rest of the&nbsp;world. In relation to the terms of trade, index incorporates&nbsp;weights which are attached to each good and service&nbsp;based on their relative importance in total exports&nbsp;and total imports.</p>
<p>Official statistics show the terms of trade as a single&nbsp;index in relation to a given base year. For instance, if&nbsp;year 0 has a base year index of 100 and in year I the&nbsp;index stands at 104.2 then this means that on average&nbsp;the country is receiving relatively better prices for its&nbsp;exports than it is having to pay other countries for its&nbsp;imports. In this case the terms of trade have improved.&nbsp;In contrast to this the value of terms of trade index 97.5&nbsp;in year 1 means that on average the country is having&nbsp;to pay a relatively higher price for its imports than it&nbsp;receiving for its own exports. In this case terms of trade&nbsp;have deteriorated.<br>Care must be taken when interpreting the terms of trade.&nbsp;A favourable movement does not necessarily imply a&nbsp;value of over 100, but simply an improvement on the&nbsp;previous year's value . So a rise in the relative price of&nbsp;exports in relation to imports, i.e. a favourable terms of&nbsp;trade, means fewer exports need now be sold to&nbsp;purchase any given quantity of imports.</p>
<p>Changes in the terms of trade are caused by changes in&nbsp;demand for and supply of imports and exports and&nbsp;particularly changes in exchange rate. For instance rising&nbsp;demand for country's exports in the international market&nbsp;or increasing supply of goods that the country imports&nbsp;is likely to improve country's terms of trade. Similarly&nbsp;a rise in the external value of country's currency would&nbsp;increase the price of country's commodities in other&nbsp;currencies and lower the prices of foreign goods in local&nbsp;currency. Hence, an appreciation of the country's&nbsp;currency would improve its terms of trade and the&nbsp;country would be able to exchange a greater quantity of&nbsp;foreign goods for a given amount of exports.</p>
<p>Favorable terms of trade have a detrimental effect on the&nbsp;country's balance of payment and living standard.&nbsp;However it depends on the price elasticity of demand&nbsp;for exports and imports. For instance, if the demand for&nbsp;imports and exports are price inelastic, as it usually is&nbsp;in the short run, then there will be a net inflow of money&nbsp;and balance of payment will improve. This is because&nbsp;rising prices of exports would bring a proportionately&nbsp;smaller fall in quantity of exports thus increasing earnings&nbsp;from exports. Also, falling prices of imports lead&nbsp;to proportionately smaller increase in imports hence&nbsp;reducing import bill. Overall country's net revenue from&nbsp;trade increases. However in the long run both the price&nbsp;elasticity of demand for imports and exports usually&nbsp;tend to be elastic. The reason for this is that a rise in&nbsp;the relative price of exports will, depending on the price&nbsp;elasticity of demand, lead to a reduction in the total&nbsp;value of export sales, whereas imports will appear&nbsp;relatively more attractive and so the total value of imports&nbsp;may increase.</p>
<p>Hence an improvement in terms of trade proves to be&nbsp;beneficial if price elasticity of demand for both exports&nbsp;and imports is inelastic. Elastic demand will worsen the&nbsp;position.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 188</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8862</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Compare the aims and features of a free trade area with&nbsp;those of an economic union.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Economic integration occurs whenever two nations or a&nbsp;group of nations in the same region join together to form&nbsp;a regional trading bloc by raising trade barriers against&nbsp;the products of non-member countries while freeing&nbsp;internal trade among members.</p>
<p>In the terminology of integration, if external tariffs against&nbsp;outside countries differ among member nations while&nbsp;internal trade is free, the nations are said to have formed&nbsp;a free trade area. Whereas an economic union possesses&nbsp;all the attributes of a free trade area plus common&nbsp;external tariffs, free movement of factors of production&nbsp;among the partner states and adoption of various uniform&nbsp;policies in areas such as agriculture, transport, regional&nbsp;and social affairs.</p>
<p>Free trade area is the lowest form of economic integration&nbsp;involving the systematic removal of trade restrictions&nbsp;between members but retaining whatever restrictions&nbsp;each member chooses with the non-member countries.&nbsp;Unlike economic union, free trade area does not&nbsp;seek to harmonise laws and regulations. Member countries&nbsp;are permitted total legal independence but they must&nbsp;treat firms of other member countries equally with their&nbsp;own firms. The prime objective of a free trade area is&nbsp;to encourage a growth in trade between its members,&nbsp;most of which is trade creation rather than trade diversion.</p>
<p>An economic union is where member countries operate&nbsp;as a single market. Like a free trade area there are no&nbsp;tariffs and quotas between member countries but there&nbsp;are common external tariffs and quotas. An economic&nbsp;union goes further than this. It includes a common system&nbsp;of taxation, a uniform system of laws and regulation&nbsp;governing production, employment and trade. A full&nbsp;economic union allows free movement of factors of&nbsp;production and common currency. Over all an economic&nbsp;union involves a single macroeconomic management&nbsp;of the whole market and hence loss of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>In conclusion an economic union aims at more extensive&nbsp;set of benefits than a free trade area. These benefits&nbsp;range from trade creation to efficient allocation of scarce&nbsp;resources among the member states. Thus it is a more&nbsp;comprehensive and rather an ambitious project.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 189</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8859</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether it is likely that the private costs and the&nbsp;social costs of production would be identical.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Private costs are borne by the producer who benefits&nbsp;from the action. They may include raw material costs,&nbsp;wages and energy payments. Social costs are the total&nbsp;costs to those directly involved in the activity and to&nbsp;the rest of society (third parties) as well. Social costs&nbsp;include external costs or spillover effects borne by&nbsp;members of society who do not benefit from the action.&nbsp;External costs are third party effects arising from&nbsp;production of goods and services for which no appropriate&nbsp;compensation is paid. These costs are generated&nbsp;in production of various goods and services. For&nbsp;instance, noise pollution and atmospheric pollution from&nbsp;factories and the long-term environmental damage caused&nbsp;by depletion of our stock of natural resources.</p>
<p>External costs are around us every day - the key point&nbsp;is that the market may fail to take them into account&nbsp;when pricing goods and services. Often this is because&nbsp;of the absence of clearly defined property rights - for&nbsp;example, who owns the air we breathe, or the natural&nbsp;resources available for extraction from seas and oceans&nbsp;around the world?</p>
<p>The existence of external costs creates a divergence&nbsp;between private and social costs of production.</p>
<p>Social Cost = Private Cost + External Cost</p>
<p>When negative production externalities exist, social costs&nbsp;exceed private cost. This leads to the private optimum&nbsp;level of output being greater than the social optimum&nbsp;level of production. The individual producer does not&nbsp;take the effects of externalities into their calculations.</p>
<p>The diagram below provides a way of illustrating the&nbsp;effects of external costs arising from production on the&nbsp;private and social costs and benefits to producers and&nbsp;consumers.<br><br>Negative externalities create external costs - if the market does&nbsp;not take externalities into account the result is that the socially&nbsp;efficient output is less than current output.<strong><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9d16a0b12c4755cad62dcc3782658498" alt="" width="500" height="270"><br></strong><br>In the absence of externalities, the private costs of the&nbsp;supplier are the same as the costs for society. But if&nbsp;there are negative externalities, we must add the external&nbsp;costs to the firm's supply curve to find the social cost&nbsp;curve as shown in the diagram above.</p>
<p>If the market fails to include these external costs, then&nbsp;the equilibrium output will be Q<sub>2</sub> and the price P<sub>2</sub>. A&nbsp;socially efficient output would be Q<sub>1</sub> with a higher price&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub>. At this price level, the external costs have been taken&nbsp;into account. We have not eliminated the external costs&nbsp;- but at least the market has recognised them and priced&nbsp;them into the price of the product.</p>
<p>However there are many occasions when the production&nbsp;of a good or a service creates external benefits which&nbsp;boost social welfare. For instance, there is growing&nbsp;evidence that skilled workforces have positive impacts&nbsp;on high-level economic aims, such as raising productivity&nbsp;and enhancing a country's GDP growth. In such cases&nbsp;private cost may be higher than social cost due to the&nbsp;external benefit.</p>
<p>While theoretically it is possible to show that private&nbsp;costs and social costs are identical, however, in the real&nbsp;world production of all different goods and services&nbsp;generates external costs and benefits and therefore creates&nbsp;a divergence between private cost and social cost.&nbsp;We can only debate about few or more external costs&nbsp;and benefits but it is unlikely that they produce none&nbsp;and it would not be the case for total output within an&nbsp;economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 190</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8851</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why a lighthouse is often given as an example of a public good while a light bulb is not.&nbsp; [8]</p>

as&nbsp;public goods. These goods can be jointly consumed by&nbsp;many individuals simultaneously at no additional cost.<br>A good must possess two distinguishing characteristics&nbsp;if it is to be classified as public good. It must be non-excludable&nbsp;and non-rival. Non-excludability entails that&nbsp;there is no effective way of excluding individuals from&nbsp;their benefits once those goods come into existence. Non-rivalry&nbsp;means as more and more people consume the&nbsp;product; the benefit to those already consuming the&nbsp;product is not diminished.<br>These two features give rise to the free rider problem;&nbsp;people receiving benefits from a good without contributing&nbsp;to its cost. It entails a situation in which everyone&nbsp;believes that others will take on the burden of paying&nbsp;for public goods such as national defense and streetlights.&nbsp;People may wish for the provision of such goods, but&nbsp;the demand may never be registered in the market.<br>Lighthouse can be categorized as public good because it&nbsp;is both non-excludability and non-rivalry. For instance the&nbsp;use by one ship of the lighthouse signal does not reduce&nbsp;the consumption of other ships. Also once a lighthouse&nbsp;is indicating hazard to one ship it cannot stop other&nbsp;ships from being warned and it is not possible to exclude&nbsp;other ships from gaining the benefit. This means that&nbsp;charging for the service is not possible as free riders&nbsp;would be able to benefit.<br>Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these&nbsp;goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive&nbsp;to supply them. Because these goods cannot be priced&nbsp;and sold, it would be unprofitable for a private enterprise&nbsp;to allocate resources to them.<br>On the contrary a light bulb is subject&nbsp;to the principles&nbsp;of exclusion, rivalry and rejectability, therefore, can be&nbsp;classified as private good. The principle of exclusion&nbsp;states that all those who are unable or unwilling to pay&nbsp;for these goods can be excluded from the products'&nbsp;benefits while rivalry means one person's consumption&nbsp;reduces the amount left for others to consume and benefit&nbsp;from - because scarce resources are used up in producing&nbsp;and supplying them. A light bulb is a private good&nbsp;as it can be charged for when sold and those who are&nbsp;unable or unwilling to pay are excluded by the price&nbsp;system. Also the light bulb is used within one person's&nbsp;home and others can be prevented from benefiting.&nbsp;Besides this private goods can be rejected i.e. one can&nbsp;use his money to buy something else if he does not like&nbsp;a particular light bulb.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 191</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8850</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss how reduced air fares on low-cost budget airlines might affect the air travel market and the markets for related goods and services.

Hence, an&nbsp;air travel market consists of all the buyers and sellers&nbsp;of air travel services. In the airline market we can&nbsp;categorize different types of air travel services offered&nbsp;by various airlines at different prices. Low-cost budget&nbsp;airlines are only one section of the overall market.</p>
<p>Lower air fare of the low cost budget airlines will not&nbsp;only attract passengers from high cost airlines but also&nbsp;give incentive to the people using alternative mode of&nbsp;transport to switch to air travel. Thus quantity demanded&nbsp;is expected to increase but whether this increases&nbsp;revenue depends on price elasticity of demand. Low&nbsp;cost budget airlines are likely to gain from a reduction&nbsp;in air fare if PED is elastic.</p>
<p>The extent to which high cost rival firms are affected&nbsp;depends on the degree of substitutability. If cross elasticity&nbsp;of demand between low-cost and high-cost airline&nbsp;services is high then the high cost rival firms might see&nbsp;the demand curve to shift to left and a decrease in their&nbsp;earnings. The rival firms then need to reduce air fare to&nbsp;remain attractive. Of course if a fierce price war does&nbsp;break out, then consumers at least temporarily may enjoy&nbsp;lower prices.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility that the high cost firms might&nbsp;retain their market share if the market segment to which&nbsp;they serve is not attracted by lower fares at the expanse&nbsp;of the quality of associated services with air travel such&nbsp;as food, lounge services etc. In that case cross elasticity&nbsp;of demand will be lower.<br>Overall the size of the market should expand with more&nbsp;people able to afford flying.</p>
<p>Then there are markets for many different related products&nbsp;which will be affected by reduction in air fare. Economists&nbsp;classify related goods and services into two&nbsp;categories: substitutes and complements. Substitutes are&nbsp;alternative products that satisfy the same wants. In case&nbsp;of air travel different types of transport - rail, buses,&nbsp;cars and ferries are the substitute modes of transportation.&nbsp;A reduction in air fare by low-cost budget line will&nbsp;reduce the demand for alternative mode of transportation.&nbsp;This is shown in the graph below:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/89d9ab8f1b6cc61e39857723c787ca7b" alt="" width="514" height="271"><br><br>In the first graph we consider the huge increase in the&nbsp;market supply of low-cost flights available. This might&nbsp;have been due to new low-cost airlines have entered the&nbsp;market or the existing airlines have expanded their route&nbsp;network and fleet capacity The market supply of flights&nbsp;has Shifted to the right from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub> leading to a&nbsp;reduction in air fare to P<sub>2</sub>. This reduction in fare not&nbsp;only encourages the passengers from high cost rival firms&nbsp;but also attracts passengers from other modes of transport.&nbsp;The effect on the demand for alternative modes of&nbsp;transport is shown in the graph on the right. Passengers&nbsp;switching to air travel from alternative mode of transportation&nbsp;resulting in a decrease in demand and earnings&nbsp;in general.</p>
<p>This will also enhance the demand for complementary&nbsp;services such as airport parking, travel insurance may&nbsp;face increased demand with upward pressure on their&nbsp;prices as shown in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/2f511c12ab923273371cbcdf5de262dc" alt="" width="442" height="232"><br><br>Demand for complementary services increases from D<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;to D<sub>2</sub> in response to a reduction in air fare by low-cost&nbsp;budget airlines.</p>
<p>All in all reduced air fare by the low cost budget airlines&nbsp;with more restricted services might have significant&nbsp;impact on the overall airline market and more importantly&nbsp;on the market for related goods and services.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 192</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8849</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>With the aid of a diagram, explain how a government subsidy to producers of fuel will affect the producers and government expenditure.

Usually the objective&nbsp;of these payments is to achieve social efficiency&nbsp;and equity. A subsidy by the government to the producers&nbsp;can take different forms. For instance. a guaranteed&nbsp;minimum price can be offered to farmers or else government&nbsp;can give an input subsidy which subsidizes the&nbsp;cost of certain inputs used in production. Moreover&nbsp;government grants can be given to loss making businesses&nbsp;or it can take the form of financial assistance&nbsp;(loans and grants) for businesses setting up in areas&nbsp;of high unemployment.<br>In any form a subsidy to the producers of fuel will&nbsp;reduce their costs of production and will encourage them&nbsp;to increase output. The effect on the market is shown&nbsp;in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8fd93ecf0aeb1eadf10cf9e817a68a13" alt="" width="487" height="256"><br><br>Subsidy to the fuel producers will reduce the marginal&nbsp;cost of supplying fuel, therefore will have the effect of&nbsp;increasing profitability. Hence, the supply curve would&nbsp;shift to the right as shown in the graph above. The&nbsp;vertical distance A - E<sub>1</sub> is equal to the per unit subsidy.&nbsp;Government expenditure will increase by the amount of&nbsp;per unit subsidy times the new quantity traded i.e. AE<sub>1</sub>X q<sub>1</sub> = cost of subsidy.<br>On the fuel market the effect of this subsidy is to reduce&nbsp;the price from p to p1 and increase the quantity traded&nbsp;from q to q<sub>1</sub>. Price will not fall by the full amount of&nbsp;the subsidy, because the demand curve is downward&nbsp;sloping. Thus the benefit of subsidy is shared between&nbsp;consumers and producers. Consumers' benefit can be&nbsp;noted by a fall in per unit price from p to p<sub>1</sub> whereas&nbsp;producers receive the remaining amount ps of per unit&nbsp;subsidy. As a consequence the consumers will benefit&nbsp;from lower price and producers will gain higher incomes&nbsp;partly due to the subsidy payment and partly due to&nbsp;the increase in quantity traded.<br>However the extent to which a subsidy will feed through&nbsp;to lower prices for consumers depends on the price elasticity&nbsp;of demand for the product. The more inelastic the&nbsp;demand curve the greater the consumers' gain from a&nbsp;subsidy. In case of fuel demand curve is expected to be&nbsp;inelastic therefore consumers are likely to gain a larger&nbsp;share of subsidy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 193</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8848</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Between 1975 and 2007 the trend in world food prices changed significantly.

<li>Market prices paid in standard money units for different goods &amp; services are called nominal&nbsp;prices. Prices adjusted for inflation are known as real prices i.e. prices where the effects of&nbsp;inflation have been factored in.</li>
<li>Real price index of food items shows declining trend before the year 2000 whereas nominal&nbsp;prices of food, although with mild fluctuations, remain stable. In the year 2000 real and nominal&nbsp;price indices converge. After the year 2000 both real and nominal prices move in similar&nbsp;manners and reflect an upward trend but the nominal prices remain slightly higher than those&nbsp;of real prices.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Weights assigned to different items represent the proportion of income spent by an average&nbsp;household.<br>The higher the weight assigned to a commodity the larger the proportion of income spent on&nbsp;the product and vice versa. The table shows significant variation in weights that indicates&nbsp;different proportion of income spent on food in five different countries. This is because&nbsp;Bangladesh, Kenya and China are lower income developing countries where food, being a necessity,&nbsp;takes up a larger proportion of income. U.K. and Australia are high income developed countries&nbsp;therefore the proportion of income spent on food is smaller because food has a saturation point,&nbsp;as people get richer.</li>
<li>U.K. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.2 x 10 = 2<br>Kenya &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.2 x 50 =10<br>A 20% rise in food prices will contribute 2% to the overall inflation rate in U.K. whereas same&nbsp;increase in food prices in Kenya will contribute l 0% to the overall inflation rate. Thus rising&nbsp;food prices will contribute five times more to the overall inflation rate in Kenya than U.K.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Price elasticity of supply (PES) is the numerical measure of the responsiveness of supply to a&nbsp;change in the price of the product alone. The relationship can be presented as a formula:<br>PES = (Percentage change in quantity supplied)/(Percentage change in price)<br>From the given information it can be concluded that PES is 0.1 or 0.2. i.e. price elasticity of supply&nbsp;is inelastic. This is where a change in price results in a proportionately smaller change in quantity&nbsp;supplied.<br>PES of food items is inelastic because it is more difficult to hold large stocks due to the perishability&nbsp;and high storing cost. PES is relatively elastic when stocks of finished· goods can be stored at low&nbsp;cost.</li>
<li>In general the price elasticity of demand of food items is low. Hence the rising food prices will&nbsp;increase producers' revenues and incomes. Moreover the farmers will be encouraged to increase their&nbsp;output of food items. The people of rural areas, in particular, are going to benefit from the additional&nbsp;flow of income. Terms of trade and trade balance of those countries which export food items is likely&nbsp;to improve as world income will be redistributed in favour of these countries.<br>However rising food prices will hurt certain groups in the economy such as low and fixed income&nbsp;earners. Similarly not all the farmers are the beneficiaries of rising food prices in fact the poorest&nbsp;subsistence farmers who buy significant additional portion of food will be hurt, The food importing&nbsp;countries will also be hit badly as their import bill is likely to increase which will adversely affect&nbsp;their trade balance. The worst fall out for almost all is the increase in inflation rate that brings income&nbsp;distortions and slows down economic growth.<br>Hence the effects of rising food prices differ for different countries and different income groups in&nbsp;the economies. It all depends on the production pattern and the level of income of countries and&nbsp;individuals.</li>

In the terminology of&nbsp;integration, nations that levy common external tariffs&nbsp;while freeing internal trade are said to have formed a&nbsp;customs union. If external tariffs against outside countries&nbsp;differ among member nations while internal trade&nbsp;is free, the nations are said to have formed a free-trade&nbsp;area. Finally, an economic union possesses all the attributes&nbsp;of a customs union (common external tariffs&nbsp;and free internal trade) plus the free movement of&nbsp;factors of production among the partner states and adoption&nbsp;of various uniform policies in areas such as agriculture,&nbsp;transport, regional and social affairs.</p>
<p>The basic economic rationale for the formation of regional&nbsp;trading groups is that integration provides the&nbsp;opportunity for industries among the member countries&nbsp;to take advantage of economies of large-scale production&nbsp;by expanded markets. Integration therefore needs to be&nbsp;viewed as a mechanism to encourage specialization and&nbsp;division of labor among a group of countries. In the&nbsp;absence of integration, each separate country may not&nbsp;provide a sufficiently large domestic market to enable&nbsp;local industries to lower their production costs through&nbsp;economies of scale.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by removing barriers to trade among member&nbsp;states, the possibility of coordinating industrial&nbsp;strategy is created, especially in industries where economies&nbsp;of scale are likely to exist, examples include fertilizer&nbsp;and petrochemical plants, heavy industries like&nbsp;iron and steel. Also, increased competition between&nbsp;member countries may stimulate efficiency, encourage&nbsp;investment and reduce monopoly powers. It might also&nbsp;result in more rapid spread of technology among the&nbsp;member states and improvement in terms of trade of the&nbsp;whole regional bloc with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>However, trade diversion is said to occur when the&nbsp;erection of external barriers causes production and consumption&nbsp;to divert from of one or more member states&nbsp;from lower-cost non-member sources of supply to higher-cost member producers. Trade diversion is normally considered&nbsp;undesirable because both the world and member&nbsp;states are perceived to be worse off as a result of&nbsp;diversion of production from more efficient foreign&nbsp;suppliers to less efficient domestic industries of member&nbsp;states. Furthermore, large-scale lower-cost producers&nbsp;will benefit at the expense of nascent and smaller higher-cost producers, some of whom could be taken over or&nbsp;go out of business. Similarly, smaller members may be&nbsp;dominated by relatively large members in the group in&nbsp;terms of policy issues or, in particular, attractiveness of&nbsp;resources. Thus, smaller members may become a&nbsp;depressed region of the group. In addition, mergers can&nbsp;take place among firms from member countries to&nbsp;develop large companies in order to gain market power,&nbsp;thus keeping prices higher to the consumer. If it results&nbsp;in the development of very large companies, they may&nbsp;become inefficient.</p>
<p>In conclusion it is pertinent to say that development of&nbsp;regional trading blocs may be better than facing trade&nbsp;barriers from individual nations but these blocs are&nbsp;inferior to worldwide free trade agreements.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 195</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8846</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>How might opportunity cost help to explain the pattern&nbsp;of international trade?</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Opportunity cost is the sacrifice of the next best outcome&nbsp;in taking a decision. For a nation, the opportunity&nbsp;cost is the amount of other products, which must be&nbsp;sacrificed to produce a unit of another product. The&nbsp;concept of opportunity cost provides basis for explanation&nbsp;of international trade.<br>According to the principle of comparative advantage total&nbsp;output will be the greatest when each good is produced&nbsp;by that nation which has the lowest domestic opportunity&nbsp;cost for that good. To illustrate this principle we&nbsp;assume that there are only two countries involved in&nbsp;trade, say Pakistan and Iran and each can produce just&nbsp;two products textile and steel. Also, opportunity costs&nbsp;are constant for each product and the exchange rate operating&nbsp;for international transaction must be between the&nbsp;respective domestic opportunity cost ratios. We also&nbsp;assume that transport costs are zero and there are no&nbsp;restrictions on free trade. Following table summarises&nbsp;production possibilities of these two countries of two&nbsp;products:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5e3335a7c0755e32e6978311af5a854c" alt="" width="563" height="234"><br><br>If it is assumed that all resources are fully employed it&nbsp;is only possible to produce one more unit of a commodity&nbsp;if resources are reallocated from the production of&nbsp;the other commodity. In case of Iran, production of one&nbsp;more unit of textiles requires 2 units of steel to be&nbsp;sacrificed, thus giving an opportunity cost ratio of 1 :&nbsp;2. In terms of Pakistan the production of one more unit&nbsp;of textiles requires 5 units of steel to be sacrificed, the&nbsp;opportunity cost ratio therefore being 1 : 5. The opportunity&nbsp;cost ratios are summerised in the following table.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1d1c0414288020cac30f697b57d658fd" alt="" width="511" height="284"><br><br>The opportunity cost of producing textiles is higher in&nbsp;Pakistan (5 units of steel), than in Iran (2 units of steel),&nbsp;whereas for steel it is higher in Iran than Pakistan. The&nbsp;difference between opportunity cost ratios means that&nbsp;there are benefits to be obtained from specialization and&nbsp;trade, with Pakistan specializing in steel and Iran in textile&nbsp;production. Pakistan can obtain one unit of textiles by&nbsp;scarifying less than 5 units of steel which is lower than&nbsp;the domestic opportunity cost. Similarly, Iran will be&nbsp;able to obtain more than 2 units of steel for each unit&nbsp;of textiles. Hence, after specialization both countries&nbsp;would be able to consume more than what they can&nbsp;produce themselves.<br>In conclusion a country therefore, has a comparative&nbsp;advantage in the production of the commodities whose&nbsp;opportunity cost is lower. There is no advantage and&nbsp;therefore, no gain to be made from trade if the opportunity&nbsp;costs are identical.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 196</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8845</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the use of cost-benefit analysis helps&nbsp;to improve economic decision making.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Cost benefit analysis (CBA) provides a framework of&nbsp;appraising major investment proposals which generate&nbsp;important but controversial side effects. It is normally&nbsp;undertaken by government departments, since it involves&nbsp;adding the external costs and benefits to the conventional&nbsp;private costs and benefits.<br>Economists recommend CBA as a means of identifying&nbsp;the right choices particularly in situations where there&nbsp;is a divergence between private and social benefits and&nbsp;costs. As mentioned above, the CBA approach differs&nbsp;from conventional private sector investment appraisal&nbsp;in two ways. Firstly, CBA is an extended approach as&nbsp;it includes all related costs and benefits to the proposed&nbsp;project, not just private ones. Secondly, CBA involves&nbsp;estimated monetary values where market prices are not&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>We can identify four distinct phases in the development&nbsp;of a cost-benefit analysis. As a first step we need to&nbsp;identify all the related costs and benefits of a proposed&nbsp;project. This includes both private costs and benefits&nbsp;and external costs and benefits. In the second phase, we&nbsp;need to assign monetary value. Where these are not&nbsp;available shadow prices of costs and benefits are used.&nbsp;In the third phase we estimate future costs and benefits&nbsp;and to do so we use statistical forecasting techniques.&nbsp;In the final phase we arrange all information to reflect&nbsp;the outcome of the whole procedure. The important&nbsp;principle is that if the value of benefits exceeds the value&nbsp;of the costs, then the particular project is desirable since&nbsp;it involves an overall net benefit to the community.<br>Economists argue that the decision taken on the basis&nbsp;of a complete cost-benefit approach are more comprehensive&nbsp;and therefore more accurate representation of&nbsp;society's welfare.</p>
<p>However, in practice, cost-benefit analysis has proved&nbsp;to be more difficult to work out. At the first stage there&nbsp;can be a potential disagreement among people as to which&nbsp;costs and benefits should be included. There are particular&nbsp;problems when it comes to determining external costs&nbsp;and benefits. These are often controversial and not easy&nbsp;to explain in clear manners and have the added difficulty&nbsp;that it is not always possible to draw the line in terms&nbsp;of a physical or geographical cut-off. For example,&nbsp;construction of a particular motorway also used by&nbsp;nationals of other countries as a transit facility would&nbsp;have costs and benefits reaching across the borders.</p>
<p>Secondly, a potential disagreement may arise when estimating&nbsp;spillover costs and benefits which are not priced&nbsp;in the market such as noise and human life. Errors in&nbsp;such estimates could affect the viability of a project.</p>
<p>There is also a problem of deciding the cut-off point for&nbsp;externalities and the time horizon. There is always the&nbsp;temptation for interested parties to extend the cut-off&nbsp;point or the time horizon in order to justify particular&nbsp;preferences. Also, CBA is of little importance where&nbsp;political decisions dominate.<br>Finally, in order to compare the competing projects, we&nbsp;have to reduce them to present values by discounting&nbsp;future costs and benefits. But, there are many different&nbsp;rates of interest.</p>
<p>The theoretical and practical difficulties outlined above&nbsp;weaken CBA's effectiveness as a tool for decision making.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, CBA provides a rational technique for appraising&nbsp;projects where market information is either nonexistent&nbsp;or deficient. But, it must not make false claims&nbsp;for objectivity by dealing in precise sums. While it is&nbsp;an aid to decision making, it is not a substitute for it.&nbsp;Its role is to present systematically all the information&nbsp;relevant to a decision, indicating the weight which can&nbsp;be placed on the accuracy of the calculations submitted.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 197</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8844</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the market failure which arises from the&nbsp;characteristics of public goods.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Market failure exists any and every time that a free&nbsp;market left to its own devices and free from any form&nbsp;of government intervention, fails to lead to the best, or&nbsp;optimum use of scarce resources.</p>
<p>One such example is public goods. These are goods or&nbsp;services, which are indivisible, and to which the exclusion&nbsp;principle does not apply and many individuals can&nbsp;jointly consume them simultaneously at no additional&nbsp;cost.</p>
<p>A good must possess two distinguishing characteristics&nbsp;if it is to be classified as public good:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be non-excludible. There is no effective&nbsp;way of excluding individuals from their benefits once&nbsp;those goods come into existence.</li>
<li>It must be non-rival. As more and more people&nbsp;consume the product, the benefit to those already&nbsp;consuming the product is not diminished.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider the example of a proposed project of&nbsp;installing road lights on a busy crossing. The installation&nbsp;would be economically justified if its benefits exceed its&nbsp;cost. But the benefits accruing to one user would not&nbsp;be good enough to justify the purchase of such an indivisible&nbsp;product. Moreover, once the lights are in&nbsp;operation they would be benefiting all users. There would&nbsp;be no practical way to exclude any user from using the&nbsp;lights.</p>
<p>These two features give rise to the free rider problem;&nbsp;people receiving benefits from a good without contributing&nbsp;to its cost. It entails a situation in which everyone&nbsp;believes that others will take on the burden of paying&nbsp;for public goods such as national defense and streetlights.&nbsp;People may wish for the provision of such goods, but&nbsp;the demand may never be registered in the market.</p>
<p>Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these&nbsp;goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive&nbsp;to supply them. Because these goods cannot be priced&nbsp;and sold, it would be unprofitable for a private enterprise&nbsp;to allocate resources to them. So, we have these&nbsp;goods which yield substantial benefits but to which the&nbsp;market would fail to allocate resources. If society requires&nbsp;such goods, they must be provided by the public&nbsp;sector and financed by compulsory charges in the form&nbsp;of taxes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it can be stated that provision of public&nbsp;goods contributes to a nation's standard of living therefore,&nbsp;there is a very strong case for having the government&nbsp;finance them.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 198</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8843</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether a country should welcome a period of&nbsp;deflation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The average level of all prices is known as the general&nbsp;price level. An increase in the price level is called inflation&nbsp;and a decrease is called deflation. Deflation is&nbsp;associated with the lean economic period, a time when&nbsp;the level of economic activity is depressed or economy&nbsp;is in a recession or in a slump. In recession, demand falls&nbsp;off, and as a result, firms accumulate stocks. In order&nbsp;to clear stocks firms start price-cutting and the general&nbsp;price level begins to fall.<br>Deflation redistributes real income in favour of fixedincome&nbsp;receivers and creditors. For instance, the elderly&nbsp;couple living on pension or annuity providing a fixed&nbsp;amount of nominal income each month or landlords who&nbsp;receive lease payments of fixed amounts will gain by&nbsp;deflation as they receive Rs. of increasing value. Similarly,&nbsp;deflation benefits savers as prices fall, the real&nbsp;value, or the purchasing power of a nest egg of savings&nbsp;improves. Deflation benefits creditors at the expense of&nbsp;borrowers. Suppose you lend Rs. 10,000, to be repaid&nbsp;in 2 years. If in that time the general level of prices falls&nbsp;by 10% , the Rs. 10,000 which you receive will have&nbsp;higher purchasing power. In other words, borrowers&nbsp;would repay higher value in real terms. To a lesser extent&nbsp;some white-collar workers, for example, some public&nbsp;sector employees whose incomes are dictated by fixed&nbsp;pay scales, and families living on fixed levels of welfare&nbsp;will be the beneficiary of inflation.<br>Deflation may also benefit a country in terms of improvement&nbsp;in trade balance. Deflation would increase&nbsp;international price competitiveness of exports and&nbsp;reduce price competitiveness of imports in the country.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the improvement of trade balance depends&nbsp;on the price elasticity of demand for both exports and&nbsp;imports.<br>However, as mentioned above, deflation is an indicator&nbsp;of a decline in the level of economic activity. In a recession,&nbsp;as the term implies, aggregate demand decreases&nbsp;driving the price level down as a result firms are forced&nbsp;to revise investment and production plans. Decline in&nbsp;output is accompanied by increasing unemployment. As&nbsp;employment falls, so do households incomes; falling&nbsp;income causes demand to fall further. Prices and hence&nbsp;profits drop and many firms make losses. The situation&nbsp;looks bleak and businesses and households lose&nbsp;confidence, resulting in a decline in all types of spending&nbsp;and driving the level of economic activity down.<br>Also, a country's national debt repayments and interest&nbsp;payment will rise in real terms. The national debt is&nbsp;what a country owes to government, institutions, and&nbsp;individuals who have bought government securities.Falling prices also hinder in remedies such as policy of&nbsp;changing interest rate.<br>Generally, creeping or mild inflation as opposed to&nbsp;deflation is considered desirable as it stimulates business&nbsp;people to invest because they may regard it as a&nbsp;sign of expanding economy and rising demand. Government&nbsp;may also benefit in terms of rising tax revenue and&nbsp;declining value of debt repayment and interest payment&nbsp;in real terms.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 199</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8842</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the characteristics required by money if it is to&nbsp;carry out its functions effectively</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Money is defined as anything which is generally acceptable&nbsp;in purchasing goods or settling debts. Economists&nbsp;have identified four important functions of money.<br>First and foremost, money is a medium of exchange; it&nbsp;is usable for buying and selling goods and services.&nbsp;Money is also used as a unit of account; society uses&nbsp;money as a scale to measure the relative worth of a wide&nbsp;variety of commodities, making possible the operation&nbsp;of a price system and automatically providing the basis&nbsp;for keeping accounts, calculating profit and loss, etc.&nbsp;Money also serves as a store of value i.e. it is a very&nbsp;convenient way to store value. Finally, it is a standard&nbsp;of deferred payments; the unit in which, given stability&nbsp;in its value, loans are made and future contracts fixed.&nbsp;Without money, there would be no common basis to&nbsp;allow for dealing in debts.<br>To perform these functions with a greater deal of effectiveness&nbsp;money must possess certain features. For instance,&nbsp;money must be available in different denomination&nbsp;to enable small purchases to take place and everyone&nbsp;must accept it as having some value. Moreover,&nbsp;money must be portable or easily carried about and must&nbsp;last a long time. In addition, money must be limited in&nbsp;supply and the value of money should not fluctuate&nbsp;wildly. Finally, it must be difficult, if not possible, to&nbsp;counterfeit.<br>Money performs its functions effectively as long as it&nbsp;possesses all the above-mentioned characteristics. People&nbsp;use money as a medium of exchange only when they are&nbsp;confident that it will be exchangeable for real goods and&nbsp;services, and resources when they spend it. Similarly,&nbsp;people will use a particular unit of money as a store of&nbsp;value only as long as there is no sizable deterioration in&nbsp;the value due to inflation. An economy can effectively&nbsp;employ money as a unit of account only when its&nbsp;purchasing power is relatively stable. A measure of value,&nbsp;which is subject to drastic shrinkage, does not permit&nbsp;buyers and sellers to establish the terms of trade clearly.&nbsp;For instance, when the value of a unit of money is&nbsp;declining rapidly, sellers will not know what to charge,&nbsp;and buyers will not know what to pay, for goods and&nbsp;services.<br>Money derives its value from its scarcity i.e. value of&nbsp;money lies in its capacity to be exchanged for goods and&nbsp;services, now or in future. Therefore, general acceptability&nbsp;of money as a medium of exchange, store of value&nbsp;and means of deferred payments lies in its being scarce&nbsp;and stable in value. In addition, money serves as an&nbsp;effective unit of account when it is durable, uniform,&nbsp;recognizable, portable and divisible. In modem world&nbsp;our confidence in money is partly a matter of law;&nbsp;currency has been designated as legal tender by government.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 200</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8841</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tyre problems for the mining industry</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2005, large-scale economic growth in China had increased the demand for minerals to record levels. As&nbsp;a result, 2005 was a boom year for mining worldwide, and output expanded rapidly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The huge earth-moving trucks used in mining need massive off-the-road (OTR) tyres. These tyres cost $20000 each and take a day to manufacture. By 2006, a major tyre producer, Bridgestone, estimated that mining&nbsp;companies required 50% more OTR tyres than in the previous year, but the tyre producers struggled to meet&nbsp;this demand from the mining companies. Tyre producers' stocks of tyres were very low, while fixed production&nbsp;capacity meant that output had remained steady since 1999. It was not technically possible to switch&nbsp;from car tyre production to making OTR tyres.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Total planned production for all of 2006 had already been sold and no new factories were due to start&nbsp;producing before the end of 2007. Another tyre producer, Michelin, intended to spend $85m on its factory&nbsp;in the US, and Bridgestone intended to raise its factory capacity in Japan in 2008.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest mining companies, usually spent $100m on 5000 tyres each year, but&nbsp;instead faced the prospect of having to stop trucks working while they had expensive tyre checks and tyre&nbsp;repairs. The company predicted that this would limit future exploration for new sources of minerals and cause&nbsp;a rise in mineral prices.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li style="text-align: left;">Analyse, with a demand and supply diagram, the change in the market for OTR tyres during 2006.</li>

<li>Demand is derived when a product is wanted as input for the final product being&nbsp;produced. Increasing need for mineral transportation requires larger fleet of trucks.&nbsp;Thus, growing demand for earth moving trucks requires increasing number of OTR&nbsp;tyres. Not only this but also these tyres are needed to keep the existing fleet of trucks&nbsp;operational. Hence, OTR tyres are not demanded for their own sake, rather they are&nbsp;needed to be used as an essential component in trucks required to transport mined&nbsp;output.<br><br></li>
<li>Price elasticity of supply refers to how supply responds to a price change. Supply&nbsp;is highly inelastic when proportionate change in quantity supplied is significantly low&nbsp;in response to a given change in price. In the year 2006, the PES of OTR tyres was&nbsp;highly inelastic because tyre producing firms, as mentioned in the text, did not have&nbsp;unused or surplus capacity. The firms were operating up to their full capacity and&nbsp;could not increase supply even when price rose. Furthermore, the firms were not able&nbsp;to meet considerable increase in demand from stocks as they were running low stocks&nbsp;of OTR tyres. In addition, it was technically not possible to increase quantity supplied&nbsp;by switching lines from car tyre production to OTR tyres. Michelin and Bridgestone,&nbsp;two large producers, planned to increase their capacity by making expensive investment&nbsp;but the expanded capacity would come into play after two years.<br><br></li>
<li>A high rate of economic growth in China led to a significant increase in demand and&nbsp;hence, considerable rise in price of OTR tyres as shown in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9d8f5f2f37ebd2ad3a530725afd9b5ef" alt="" width="311" height="243"><br><br>It can be seen from the graph that there is a major increase in demand whereas supply&nbsp;is less responsive to price. Initially, the equilibrium is located at point e where&nbsp;demand and supply curves intersect. A record increase in demand in the year 2006&nbsp;is shown by a shift from D to D<sub>1</sub>. This increase in demand creates a shortage e -&nbsp;b at the original price OP. The inability of firms to increase supply by much exerts&nbsp;pressure on the price to rise significantly. As it does so there is a movement along&nbsp;the supply curve from point e to e<sub>1</sub>, and along the new demand curve D<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;from&nbsp;point b to e<sub>1</sub>. Thus, new equilibrium is found at&nbsp;e<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>with higher price but no significant&nbsp;change in quantity traded.<br><br></li>
<li>Productivity refers to output per unit of input per time period. Productivity is&nbsp;expected to decline due to the lack of and poor quality of complementary inputs.&nbsp;Shortage of OTR tyres, being an important component of trucks used in transportation&nbsp;of mined output, would limit the transportation of output produced by mining&nbsp;companies. Firms, in order to continue momentum of production, would use obsolete&nbsp;or repaired tyres in their trucks, which might result in expensive tyre checks and&nbsp;frequent breakdowns leading to a decline in productivity of inputs used in mining.<br><br></li>
<li>The frequent hold up in production, caused by tyre shortage, would reduce productivity&nbsp;and therefore, is expected to slow down the growth rate and increase unemployment&nbsp;particularly in countries more reliant on mining. Rising prices of tyres&nbsp;would also increase import bill of the countries relying on imported tyres and hence,&nbsp;worsen their trade balance. Thus, inflation caused by this may become a serious issue&nbsp;as it brings instability in markets. Under these circumstances, government intervention&nbsp;is required to maintain growth momentum and to avoid possible loss of jobs.&nbsp;Moreover, governments may be required to intervene in order to reduce distortions&nbsp;in other macro economic variables namely inflation and trade balance.<br><br>On the contrary, free market economists are naturally distrustful of government intervention&nbsp;in the economy. They believe that the price mechanism is a self correcting&nbsp;system therefore, the signalling, incentive and rationing functions of the price mechanism&nbsp;should be given more freedom to operate instead. They argue that government&nbsp;intervention does not come free from unwelcome side effects. For instance, government&nbsp;may not have the expertise to manage the market and thus, intervention may&nbsp;result in government failure. It is most likely to occur when decisions are made in&nbsp;the vested interest of special groups, at the expense of other groups resulting in a&nbsp;loss of equity. Moreover, government intervention may lead to a severe deepening&nbsp;of an existing market failure and a loss of both allocative and productive efficiency.&nbsp;Thus, inefficiency caused by undue intervention results in a waste of scarce resources&nbsp;leading to a reduction in consumer and producer welfare. It can also be argued,&nbsp;particularly in the context of OTR tyres, that the problem of shortage would not&nbsp;prolong as firms have already planned an expansion in their output. Also, the impact&nbsp;would be different in different economies therefore, not all governments would be&nbsp;equally concerned about the prevailing shortage.<br><br>In conclusion, government intervention may be justified only in circumstances of&nbsp;severe and prolonged instability in the markets caused by shortages.</li>

Discuss the relative reliability&nbsp;of these two measures.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Officially, the unemployed are people who are registered&nbsp;as able, available and willing to work at the going&nbsp;wage rate in a suitable job but who cannot find work&nbsp;despite an active search for work.</p>
<p>There are two common measures of unemployment used&nbsp;in official statistics.</p>
<p>The Claimant Count, measure of unemployment, counts&nbsp;only those people who are eligible to claim the Job&nbsp;Seeker's Allowance. Claimants who satisfy the criteria&nbsp;receive the JSA for six months before moving onto special&nbsp;employment measures.</p>
<p>The other main measure involves a labour force survey&nbsp;using the International Labour Organisation definition of unemployment. This includes as unemployed all people of working age who, in a specified period, are without work but who are available for work in the next two&nbsp;weeks and who are seeking paid employment.</p>
<p>This measure picks up some of the groups not included in the first measure.</p>
<p>Claimant statistics have the advantage of being very easy to collect. However, they exclude all those of working age who are available for work at current wage rates, but&nbsp;who are not eligible for benefits. If the government&nbsp;changes the eligibility conditions so that fewer people are now eligible, this will reduce the number of claimants&nbsp;and hence the official number unemployed, even if&nbsp;there has been no change in the numbers with or without work.</p>
<p>One problem with the claimant count is that it misses&nbsp;out many people who are interested in finding work and who might have searched for work in the recent period but they don't meet all of the criteria for claiming and&nbsp;therefore are not included in the monthly unemployment count.</p>
<p>For instance, the following categories of people are ineligible&nbsp;for benefits and are thus not included in claimant unemployment in UK.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Parents who up to now have been at home raising&nbsp;children.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Those who cannot find jobs are found places on&nbsp;government youth training schemes.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Men between 60 and 65 who are seeking employment.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;The temporarily unemployed.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;People seeking part-time work.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people may want to work full time.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Discouraged workers.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Disguised unemployment.</p>
<p>Although, from an economist's perspective, the claimant:&nbsp;figures underestimate the true extent of unemployment,&nbsp;it is possible that they nevertheless include some&nbsp;people whom economists would not regard as being&nbsp;genuinely unemployed. For example, some people in receipt of unemployment-related benefits may have taken early retirement and be in receipt of an occupational&nbsp;pension, or have given up employment in order to raise a family, or would rather live on unemployment benefit than take a job. Other people may turn down several offers of employment in the hope of getting a better&nbsp;offer. Some other people may already have a job but pretend that they are unemployed so as to be able to claim benefits.</p>
<p>Governments have tightened up their checks on claimants in recent years in order to prevent fraudulent claims.&nbsp;It has also made the eligibility conditions for benefits tougher. Claimants have to be able to demonstrate that they are actively seeking work and are prepared to accept suitable work when it is offered. It is thus likely that there are very few people nowadays who receive the&nbsp;job seeker's allowance, and who thus appear in the official unemployment statistics, who are not (by the&nbsp;economist's definition) unemployed.</p>
<p>The labour force survey has the advantage that as it is based on internationally agreed concepts and definitions,&nbsp;it makes international comparisons easier. However, the data are more expensive and time-consuming to collect than the unemployment benefit measure. Also as they&nbsp;are based on a sample survey they are subject to sampling error. Therefore selection of samples is very important&nbsp;in terms of true representative of the population.</p>
<p>In conclusion The Labour Force Survey covers those who have looked for work in the past month and are able to start work in the next two weeks. The claimant count only includes those who are unemployed and claiming benefit. As such it excludes a number of people who are classed as unemployed under the ILO definition for example women seeking work whose partners are on means tested benefit. Also many countries do not pay unemployment benefit therefore the claimant count system cannot be used as a means of international comparison. Therefore, Labour force survey, if carefully conducted, is a better measure of unemployment.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 202</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8829</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, with examples, why labour productivity might&nbsp;vary between countries.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Productivity refers to the quantity of goods and services&nbsp;that a worker is able to produce in a particular&nbsp;period of time. It can be measured by the following&nbsp;formula:<br>productivity = (Total output)/(No. of workers employed)<br>Labour is not a uniform resource, hence, there are variations&nbsp;in productivity of labour. For example, throughout&nbsp;the developing world, levels of labour productivity are&nbsp;extremely low compared with those in developed countries.&nbsp;Several factors account for these variations.<br>The difference between productivity among nations can&nbsp;be explained by the lack of and quality of complementary&nbsp;factor inputs such as natural resources, physical&nbsp;capital and experienced management. Countries, rich in&nbsp;better quality natural resources, have managed to increase&nbsp;productivity of labour in comparison with countries&nbsp;lacking better quality natural resources.<br>History shows that many countries have been able to&nbsp;raise productivity by increasing investment in physical&nbsp;capital and human capital. For instance, a high-tech&nbsp;boom in developed countries, such as Japan, has led to&nbsp;a sharp acceleration of productivity growth due to greater&nbsp;use of efficient and automated machines and highly skilled&nbsp;labour force. Whereas countries like India have shown&nbsp;low productivity because production processes are more&nbsp;labour intensive and poorly trained workers are combined&nbsp;with simple traditional tools to work with.<br>Thus industrially developed nations such as Germany&nbsp;and Japan combine labour with more and better capital&nbsp;equipment, hence productivity of labour is manifold in&nbsp;comparison to productivity in an underdeveloped country&nbsp;such as Pakistan, where amount of capital per worker&nbsp;is low and the quality of capital is poor.<br>Similarly countries making continuous investment in developing&nbsp;educational and training programmes to make&nbsp;their labour force more appropriate to the needs of the&nbsp;developing societies have shown more progress in enhancing&nbsp;productivity. The four Asian Tigers South Korea,&nbsp;Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are often attributed&nbsp;to the quality of their human resources and the organization&nbsp;of production system to accelerate their productivity&nbsp;growth.<br>Difference in physical health of workers also reveals the&nbsp;difference in productivity in developed and developing&nbsp;countries. Poor dietary habits, inadequate food and low&nbsp;level of personal hygiene can cause deterioration in a&nbsp;workers' health and therefore adversely affect their attitude&nbsp;towards the job and the people at work.<br>Healthier and happier labour force is believed to be more&nbsp;motivated to work, hence results in higher productivity.&nbsp;Many developed nations, for example UK, the state&nbsp;provides pension, health care, unemployment and social&nbsp;security benefits which should ensure that the labour&nbsp;force is healthy and happy and above all more productive.<br>Finally, we conclude that variation in labour productivity&nbsp;is attributed to the quantity and quality of natural&nbsp;and physical resources, organizational skills of entrepreneurs,&nbsp;health, education, motivation and most importantly&nbsp;the skill level of labour force.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 203</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8826</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss, with the aid of a demand and supply diagram, the effects on consumers and producers when the government introduces an indirect tax on a good.

consumers, but&nbsp;indirectly via the sellers of the commodities. The examples&nbsp;of two major indirect taxes in the UK include&nbsp;excise duties on cigarettes, alcohol and fuel and value&nbsp;added tax on various other items.<br>VAT is an example of an ad valorem tax. The tax levied&nbsp;increases in proportion to the value of the tax base. In&nbsp;the case of VAT, the tax base is the price of the good.&nbsp;Excise duties on the other hand are an example of a&nbsp;specific or unit tax. The amount of tax levied does&nbsp;not change with the value of the goods but with the&nbsp;amount or volume of the goods purchased.<br>Taxes are levied by the government for a number of&nbsp;reasons. It can range from raising revenue to discourage&nbsp;production and consumption of certain products in order&nbsp;to improve efficiency. A tax increases the costs of a&nbsp;business causing a inward shift in the supply curve. The&nbsp;vertical distance between the pre-tax and the post-tax&nbsp;supply curve shows the tax per unit.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6f895362e20338624236af84c32f94b9" alt="" width="293" height="199"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/fa02eab467aeeb64563cafe38e822dbc" alt="" width="267" height="184"><br><br>With an indirect tax, the supplier may be able to pass&nbsp;on some or all of this tax onto the consumer through a&nbsp;higher price. This is known as incidence of tax i.e. shifting&nbsp;the burden of the tax and the ability of businesses to&nbsp;do this depends on the price elasticity of demand and&nbsp;supply.<br>Note that the effect of an ad valorem tax is to cause a&nbsp;pivotal shift in the supply curve. This is because the&nbsp;tax is a percentage of the unit cost of supplying the&nbsp;product.<br>The curve S in figures above is before tax and S+ t is&nbsp;the supply after tax. As a result price rises from P to&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub> and quantity sold decreases from Q to Q<sub>1</sub> . The rise in price from P to&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;is the amount of tax passed on&nbsp;to consumers and thus represents the consumer's share&nbsp;of the tax. This increase in price from P to P<sub>1</sub> is less&nbsp;than the per unit tax measured on vertical axis P<sub>1</sub>t. The&nbsp;remaining is the producers' share. This is the amount by&nbsp;which the producers' net price P<sub>1</sub> - tax is below the&nbsp;original price. The government's tax revenue can be&nbsp;measured by multiplying per unit tax and after tax quantity,&nbsp;i.e. the sum of both producers' and consumers' share&nbsp;of the tax.<br>As mentioned earlier the incidence of tax depends on the&nbsp;relative elasticities of demand and supply of the commodity&nbsp;in question. These different situations have been&nbsp;given in figures below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/fb61c0b2272f5628f52a4920e2ea3a93" alt="" width="264" height="180"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/47cea1fa39de940a61227f5ab8b00ea5" alt="" width="265" height="203"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4e5ce63de3a6c84c9c3ef44627ef192b" alt="" width="246" height="187"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1ebb2dfa429bd1feebffcc2acefaf8fc" alt="" width="254" height="162"><br><br>In each of the diagrams the size of the tax is the same&nbsp;shifting the supply curve upward by the same amount.&nbsp;Price rises to P<sub>2</sub> in each case and quantity falls to Q<sub>2</sub>:&nbsp;but as we see, the size of this increase in price and&nbsp;decrease in quantity differs in each case, depending on&nbsp;the price elasticities of demand and supply. The higher&nbsp;the PED and lower the PES the greater the producers'&nbsp;share than the consumers' share of the tax as shown in&nbsp;figures. On the other hand the lower the PED and higher&nbsp;the PES, lower is the producers' share and greater the&nbsp;consumers' share as shown in figures.<br>Similarly, in extreme cases when PED is infinite or PES&nbsp;= 0. Complete burden of tax falls on producers and&nbsp;hence, the consumers' share of the tax becomes zero.&nbsp;The government's tax revenue is much smaller owing to&nbsp;a proportionately greater fall in quantity sold but the&nbsp;producers' revenue falls by even a larger amount as shown&nbsp;in the figures below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a65ec010c0e88d18b1055f6010c7420c" alt="" width="284" height="177"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/bcc236d8bf09c2ce35c85bdeaac4aca6" alt="" width="277" height="172"><br><br>On the contrary, when PED = 0 or PES is infinite,&nbsp;consumers' share of the tax is equal to the tax levied.&nbsp;Hence, producers' share become zero and the tax revenue&nbsp;received by the government will be higher.

All economic&nbsp;decisions are taken by individual households and&nbsp;firms, which are assumed to act in their own self&nbsp;interest. Firms seek to maximize profits, consumers are&nbsp;motivated by the desire to maximize their utility and&nbsp;workers seek to maximize their wages.<br>The essence of pure free market system is price mechanism,&nbsp;often quoted as 'invisible hand', operating on its&nbsp;own with no intervention by government.<br>The price mechanism is a term used to describe the&nbsp;means by which the many millions of decisions taken&nbsp;each day by consumers and businesses to determine the&nbsp;allocation of scarce resources between competing uses.&nbsp;This apparently chaotic system of millions of separate&nbsp;transactions would not only allocate resources but it&nbsp;would allocate resources efficiently. It is not necessary&nbsp;that government or any other authority directs resources.&nbsp;The hidden hand of the market would do the job, and&nbsp;do it far better.<br>One of the three important functions of price mechanism&nbsp;is signaling through which resources are allocated.&nbsp;Prices rise and fall to reflect shortages and surpluses.This&nbsp;means that market prices will adjust to demonstrate where&nbsp;resources are required, and where they are not.<br>So, for example, assume that lobbying from environmentalists&nbsp;against leather products, arguing that their&nbsp;production inflicts environmental damages, changes consumers'&nbsp;preferences. In the market fewer leather products&nbsp;will be purchased. In the short run, companies in&nbsp;the leather trade are likely to cut prices to boost demand&nbsp;but this will depress profits. In the long run, some firms&nbsp;will leave the industry, reducing supply. This in turn&nbsp;will affect the factor markets. For instance, the demand&nbsp;by firms in the leather industry for workers, equipment&nbsp;and animals will fall. So wages of workers may fall. The&nbsp;price of land for cattle farms may fall too. Some workers&nbsp;will leave the industry attracted by higher wages&nbsp;elsewhere whilst land will be put to other uses. Meanwhile,&nbsp;consumers will have increased their spending on&nbsp;other goods, for instance, on synthetic leather. In the&nbsp;short term the price of synthetic leather will rise. Increased&nbsp;profits will attract new firms into the industry,&nbsp;thus boosting supply. This will increase the demand for&nbsp;factors of production used in the making of synthetic&nbsp;leather.<br>If market prices are rising because of high and rising&nbsp;demand from consumers, this is a signal to suppliers to&nbsp;expand their production to meet the higher demand and&nbsp;more resources will be directed to produce that commodity&nbsp;and vice versa.<br>Thus resources are allocated and reallocated through price&nbsp;mechanism according to the preferences of consumers.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 205</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8818</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether a firm's revenue would increase, in&nbsp;response to price and income changes, if the price elasticity&nbsp;and income elasticity of demand for its product&nbsp;became highly elastic.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Price elasticity of demand is a numerical measure of&nbsp;responsiveness of quantity demanded following a change&nbsp;in the price of the same commodity.</p>
<p>PED=(% change in QD)/(% change in price)</p>
<p>When we measure PED we wish to know the extent&nbsp;to which a change in price of a commodity will cause&nbsp;the quantity demanded to change. Demand is highly&nbsp;elastic where QD changes by a significantly larger proportion&nbsp;than any given change in price. Ignoring the negative&nbsp;sign, it will have a value greater than 1.</p>
<p>Income elasticity of demand is responsiveness of demand&nbsp;following a change in income alone. The formula used&nbsp;is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;YED=(% change in QD)/(% change in income)</p>
<p>Demand is said to be highly income elastic where QD&nbsp;changes by a significantly larger % than any given %&nbsp;change in Y. YED, irrespective of the degree of elasticity,&nbsp;has a positive value for normal goods because there&nbsp;is a direct relationship between income and demand and&nbsp;a negative value for inferior goods owing to the inverse&nbsp;relationship between consumers' income and demand.</p>
<p>Businesses are always interested to know when it is&nbsp;best to raise prices or not to raise prices. The answer&nbsp;depends on the effects of pricing decision on TR, or&nbsp;total receipts, that is determined by PED.</p>
<p>Total revenue is the total amount received by firms from&nbsp;the sale of a product, before the deduction of taxes or&nbsp;any other costs. TR can be measured by multilying per&nbsp;unit price and the quantity sold i.e. TR = P x Q</p>
<p>Where demand is highly elastic, QD changes proportionately&nbsp;more than price. Thus the change in quantity&nbsp;has a bigger effect on TR than does the change in price&nbsp;as illustrated by the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6c7b3d0b1d019a9a071c62cf757160fd" alt="" width="259" height="182"></p>
<p>When the price falls from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, the total revenue&nbsp;increases as the loss in revenue ( - ) is outweighed by the&nbsp;gain (+). This arises because demand is highly elastic.&nbsp;Note that the shaded area is common both before and&nbsp;after the price fall. Similarly, when demand is inelastic&nbsp;QD changes proportionately less than price. Therefore,&nbsp;the change in quantity has a smaller effect on TR than&nbsp;does the change in price as shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/0e5782be9ac64647cc7a19c441aa4fb8" alt="" width="221" height="218"></p>
<p>A fall in price from P<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to P<sub>1</sub> leads to a reduction in total&nbsp;revenue with the loss (-) being greater than the gain (+).<br>PED is determined by several factors, for instance, the&nbsp;closer the substitutes for a particular commodity, the&nbsp;higher will be its price elasticity of demand. Also price&nbsp;elasticity of demand is greater in the long run than in&nbsp;the short run because people may find it hard to adjust&nbsp;their spending patterns. Furthermore, higher the proportion&nbsp;of income spent on a good, the more consumers&nbsp;are forced to cut consumption when its price rises, the&nbsp;bigger will be the income effect and the more elastic will&nbsp;be the demand. Lastly, the more people consider the&nbsp;product as a luxury item or the product lacks addictive&nbsp;properties and strong brand image, the higher the PED.</p>
<p>The direction of change in TR also depends on the&nbsp;direction of change in income and the type of commodity&nbsp;i.e normal or inferior good. When YED is positive,&nbsp;irrespective of income elastic or inelastic demand, an&nbsp;increase in Y always results in an increase in TR and&nbsp;a decrease in Y results in a decrease in TR due to positive&nbsp;income effect. In case when YED is a negative value, an&nbsp;increase in consumers' incomes results in a decrease in&nbsp;TR and a fall in income leads to an increase in TR owing&nbsp;to the negative income effect.</p>
<p>The extent to which TR changes depends on the degree&nbsp;of YED. When YED is positive (normal good)and highly&nbsp;elastic i.e. &gt; 1, a proportionately larger increase in&nbsp;quantity demanded in response to increase in incomes&nbsp;will have a bigger positive effect on TR. On the contrary,&nbsp;when YED is negative (inferior good) and highly&nbsp;elastic, an increase in consumers' incomes results in proportionately&nbsp;greater fall in QD and hence, will have a&nbsp;larger negative effect on TR. Unlike this, in times of&nbsp;economic recession, when incomes are generally low&nbsp;businesses selling inferior goods will have an increase in&nbsp;their TR and businesses selling normal goods will receive&nbsp;a cut in their TR.</p>
<p>This can be further explained by the determinants of&nbsp;YED. For instance, as people's incomes rise demand for&nbsp;luxury goods expands more rapidly, hence, YED for these&nbsp;goods is expected to be positive and &gt; 1. But this rise&nbsp;in incomes results in proportionately smaller rise in QD&nbsp;for basic goods such as bread and even a reduction in&nbsp;demand for inferior goods. The extent of responsiveness&nbsp;of demand to a given change in Y also depends on the&nbsp;level of incomes of consumer, for example, for a given&nbsp;rise in income, poor people may buy a lot more cheese,&nbsp;whereas rich people may buy only a little more.<br>In the end we conclude that highly elastic PED and&nbsp;YED may result in both rise and fall in TR. In case of&nbsp;PED it depends on the direction of change in price and&nbsp;in case of income elasticity the change in TR is not&nbsp;only dependent on the direction of change in income&nbsp;but also the type of product in consideration.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 206</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8815</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how an equilibrium price for a product is established&nbsp;in the market and how it may change.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Equilibrium means a state of equality or a state of balance&nbsp;between the two market forces i.e. demand and supply.&nbsp;In other words, an equilibrium price is when QD = QS&nbsp;and without a shift in demand and/or supply there will&nbsp;be no change in market price.<br>Prices where demand and supply are out of balance are&nbsp;termed points of disequilibrium.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e2b64f1377310c2fef64afba058c57bc" alt="" width="332" height="249"></p>
<p>Let us begin our analysis with the basic supply-demand&nbsp;diagram. The vertical axis, in the figure above, shows&nbsp;the price of a good, measured in dollars per unit. The&nbsp;horizontal axis shows the total quantity demanded and&nbsp;supplied, Q, measured in number of units per period.</p>
<p>The supply curve S tells us how much producers are&nbsp;willing to sell for each price that they receive in the&nbsp;market. The curve slopes upward because the higher the&nbsp;price, the more firms are usually able and willing to&nbsp;produce and sell.</p>
<p>The demand curve D tells us how much consumers are&nbsp;willing to buy for each price per unit that they must&nbsp;pay. It slopes downward because consumers are usually&nbsp;ready to buy more if the price is lower.</p>
<p>The two curves intersect at the equilibrium, or market&nbsp;clearing, price and quantity. At this price (P), the quantity&nbsp;supplied and the quantity demanded are just equal.</p>
<p>To understand why markets tend to clear, suppose the&nbsp;price were initially above the market clearing level, say,&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub>, Then producers would try to produce and sell more&nbsp;than consumers were willing to buy. A surplus would&nbsp;accumulate, and to sell this surplus or at least prevent&nbsp;it from growing producers would begin to lower their&nbsp;prices. Eventually price would fall, quantity demanded&nbsp;would increase, and quantity supplied would decrease&nbsp;until the equilibrium price P was reached.</p>
<p>The opposite would happen if the price were initially&nbsp;below P, say, at P<sub>2</sub>. A shortage would develop because&nbsp;consumers would be unable to purchase all they would&nbsp;like at this price. This would put upward pressure on&nbsp;price as consumers tried to outbid one another for existing&nbsp;supplies and producers reacted by increasing price and&nbsp;expanding output. Again, the price would eventually reach&nbsp;P.</p>
<p>The strength of the system lies in the tendency for the&nbsp;price to change until the market clears i.e. QD = QS. At&nbsp;this point there is neither shortage nor excess supply&nbsp;so there is also no pressure for the price to change&nbsp;further.</p>
<p>This equilibrium price will remain unchanged only so&nbsp;long as the demand and supply curves remain unchanged.&nbsp;If either of the two curves shifts, a new equilibrium will&nbsp;be formed as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/52197c1e7e1d88dac66394e3a73fb093" alt="" width="347" height="253"></p>
<p>A rise in consumers' money incomes, for instance, led&nbsp;to the demand curve shifting to D<sub>2</sub>, there would be a&nbsp;shortage of e - g at the original price P. This would&nbsp;cause price to rise to the new equilibrium P<sub>1</sub>. As it did&nbsp;so, there would be a movement along the supply curve&nbsp;from point g to point i, and along the new demand curve&nbsp;(D<sub>2</sub>) from point g to point i. Equilibrium quantity would&nbsp;rise from Q to Q<sub>1</sub>.<br>Likewise, if one of the determinants of supply changes&nbsp;the supply curve will shift causing a movement along&nbsp;the demand curve to the new intersection point.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1149a27fefce895025e592751c3770cf" alt="" width="335" height="246"></p>
<p>For example, in figure above if costs of production rose,&nbsp;the supply curve would shift to the left to S<sub>1</sub> There&nbsp;would be a shortage of e - j at the old price of P. Price&nbsp;would rise from P to P<sub>1</sub>. Quantity would fall from Q&nbsp;to Q<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>Sometimes a number of determinants might change simultaneously&nbsp;leading to a shift in both curves. When&nbsp;this happens equilibrium simply moves from the point&nbsp;where the old curves intersected to the point where the&nbsp;new ones intersect as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/cb7f388ccbacf60423ece4144fbbe004" alt="" width="344" height="251"></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The US current account remained in deficit between 1980 and 2002 with the&nbsp;exception of 1980, 1981 and 1991 when the US had current account surplus.&nbsp;On the whole, volatile fluctuations in the US current account balance reflect a&nbsp;cyclical pattern. For instance, the surplus in 1980 and 1981 was followed by&nbsp;a deficit that was replaced by another short period surplus in 1991.</li>
<li>Current account records payments for imports and exports of goods and services,&nbsp;plus net investment incomes and transfers for a designated period. A&nbsp;current account deficit is where outflows exceed inflows and expenditure is,&nbsp;therefore, higher than income. Hence, a growing deficit requires increasing amount&nbsp;of extra funds that can come from capital inflows. Alternatively, the deficit can&nbsp;be made up either by borrowing from abroad or by running down savings.<br>The US deficit on current account must have been matched by surplus in capital&nbsp;account. It might have been possible due to the excess of foreign investment into&nbsp;US or excess of international borrowing by the US government. Also the US&nbsp;government might have used its reserves to finance this deficit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A surplus on current account subsequently results in appreciation of a country's&nbsp;currency as shown in the diagram below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/48f82c6193c6ad4ac4ff55cc19d97524" alt="" width="374" height="261"><br><br>The result of rising exports and decreasing imports will be a shift in both demand&nbsp;for and supply of domestic currency to the right in the foreign currency market.&nbsp;These changes in demand and supply cause exchange rate to appreciate.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Depreciation means a fall in the free market exchange rate of the domestic currency&nbsp;with foreign currency. The lower exchange rate would make country's exports&nbsp;competitive and thus more would be sold. Furthermore, It would also make&nbsp;imports into the country more expensive and thus less would be purchased.&nbsp;However, whether depreciation ultimately improves current account of a country&nbsp;depends on PED for exports and PED for imports. According to the Marshall Learner&nbsp;condition depreciation will improve current account only if the sum of&nbsp;price elasticities of demand for imports and exports is greater than 1. Where the&nbsp;sum of the two elasticities is less than one depreciation results in further worsening&nbsp;of current balance.</li>
<li>Overall, the analysis of the two figures confirms the expected impact of exchange&nbsp;rate depreciation on current balance. Movement in the US current account balance&nbsp;in fig.1 follows fluctuations in exchange rate shown in Fig.2. During the first&nbsp;two years, the lower value of $ turns current balance into surplus. A strengthening&nbsp;of $ for the next 3 years led to a deepening of current account deficit. From&nbsp;1985 onwards $ looses value against Euro but the effects of weakening $ are&nbsp;seen in an improvement in current account deficit as late as in 1987. Hence, the&nbsp;growing deficit in two years 1986 ＆ 87 is contrary to expectation. This might&nbsp;have been due to the time that it takes before depreciation begins to influence&nbsp;the levels of both exports and imports. This time lag can be explained by the&nbsp;concept of short run price elasticity of demand which, according to J-curve effect, is&nbsp;less than 1 for both exports and imports. The two figures repeatedly confirm&nbsp;this time lag in the years 1992 and then in 2002.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Foreign exchange rate is the rate at which one currency trades for another on the&nbsp;foreign exchange market. Fixed exchange rate is one of the two fundamantal exchange&nbsp;rate mechanisms that countries follow as part of their exchange rate policy in different&nbsp;times. A totally fixed exchange rate system is where authorities take whatever measures&nbsp;are necessary to maintain the exchange rate at some stated level.<br>A fixed exchange rate eliminates uncertainty in international trade and investment.&nbsp;Both become less risky, since profits are not affected by movements in the exchange&nbsp;rate. This gives confidence to businesses to enter into long term contract and give&nbsp;credit. Hence it promotes free trade and also encourages capital movement.<br>Furthermore, a government may follow fixed echange rate system to maintain the rate&nbsp;below its true market value in order to boost its exports and curb imports. For&nbsp;instance, Chinese authorities have pegged their currency to the US$ at a rate considered&nbsp;below its true worth, mainly to continue growth momentum in their exports.&nbsp;In additition, speculators might force a currency's value up or down to make profits,&nbsp;fixed exchange rate reduces these artificial fluctuations.<br>On the contrary, a persistent current account deficit means strains would be felt on&nbsp;foreign currency and gold reserves or alternatively, surplus on capital account is&nbsp;required to finance this deficit which is likely to lead to an accumulation of overseas&nbsp;debt. This may become a burden in terms of future interest payments. In addition,&nbsp;unpopular deflationary measures might have to be introduced such as increasing tax&nbsp;rates and cutting government expenditure, or protectionist measure such as tariff,&nbsp;quota and exchange controls.<br>Authorities also loose control over monetary adjustment to balance macro economic&nbsp;variables such as inflation as interest rates have to be pegged to world levels. Consequently,&nbsp;government cannot control inflation or any other macro economic variables,&nbsp;by attempts to control money supply. Thus inflation will depend on world&nbsp;rates, which may be high and domestically unacceptable.<br>Overall fixed exchange rate system is seen as too inflexible. But countries adopt this&nbsp;mechanism particularly in times of uncertainty caused by volatile fluctuations in&nbsp;exchange rate.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">The world's water crisis is simple to understand. The amount of water in the world is finite. The world's&nbsp;population is expected to grow from 6 billion today to 8.9 billion in 2050 and our water use is growing&nbsp;even faster. A third of the world's population lives in countries where water supplies are under severe&nbsp;pressure. By 2025, this is expected to rise to two-thirds. In total, there is more than enough water available&nbsp;for everyone's basic needs, but access and consumption are unequal. The United Nations (UN) recommends&nbsp;that people need a minimum of 50 litres of water a day for drinking, washing, cooking and sanitation.&nbsp;In 1990, over a billion people did not have even that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Global water consumption rose six-fold between 1900 and 1995, more than double the rate of population&nbsp;growth. The needs of farming, industry and households also continue to increase. As important as the&nbsp;quantity of water is quality. As pollution increases in some areas, the amount of usable water declines.<br>70% of the water used worldwide is currently used for agriculture. Pressure on supplies will increase as&nbsp;more people adopt western lifestyles and diets, which require far more water than those of other cultures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The poor are the ones who suffer most. Water shortages can mean long walks to fetch water, high prices&nbsp;to buy it, food insecurity and disease from drinking dirty water. Economic development in these poorer&nbsp;countries could provide the funds to tackle water problems, but economic development needs agriculture&nbsp;and industry to drive it and these require yet more water.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The UN-backed World Commission on Water estimated in 2000 that an additional $100 billion a year would&nbsp;be needed to tackle water scarcity worldwide. Even if this money can be found, spending it wisely is a&nbsp;further challenge. Dams and other large-scale projects now affect 60% of the world's largest rivers and&nbsp;provide millions with water. But in many cases the costs in terms of population displacement and irreversible&nbsp;changes in nearby ecosystems have been considerable.<strong><br></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The state of Rajasthan gets little rain compared to other parts of India and has been hit by drought several&nbsp;years in a row. In Kishangarh, as in many other parts of the state, the natural problem is made worse by&nbsp;human intervention. The town is an important centre for the marble trade. It is located near marble mines&nbsp;and the main Delhi to Mumbai highway. Marble is brought here to be cut and polished and then despatched&nbsp;to wholesale marble markets across India. There are 400 marble-cutting units in Kishangarh, which between&nbsp;them employ nearly 100000 people. High-speed water jets are used to spray the marble blocks and keep&nbsp;them cool while they are being cut to size. One factory alone uses up to 10000 litres a day, obtained&nbsp;entirely from the area's groundwater resources. Groundwater is also the only source of water for the many&nbsp;villagers who live in the area and depend on farming for their livelihood. 'They use so much water while&nbsp;we barely have enough for our basic sanitary needs, let alone to water our crops,' said a local farmer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over two million villagers in the state of Rajasthan are forced to buy water from private suppliers to&nbsp;supplement the daily supply. Special tankers, drawn by tractors, make the rounds of the villages in the&nbsp;area of Kishangarh every day. The problems are made worse by the pollution created by the marble factories&nbsp;during the production process. Cutting marble generates a huge amount of fine dust which covers the ground&nbsp;with a fine layer. This prevents rainwater from percolating into the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Twenty years ago Kishangarh had two large lakes, which supplied it with water through the year even&nbsp;when there was little rainfall. Now, since the increase in the activities of the marble factories, they have&nbsp;dried up completely.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Extract 5 The Concept of virtual water as a basis for efficient trade<br></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some countries are now using the new concept of 'virtual water' to determine their agricultural and industrial&nbsp;production strategies 'and their trading policies. Virtual water is the amount of water needed to create goods.&nbsp;When you consume one, kilo of grain, you are in effect also consuming the 1000 litres of water needed&nbsp;to grow that grain; when you consume one kilo of beef, you are consuming the 13000 litres of water&nbsp;needed to produce that amount of meat, and this is the hidden or virtual water involved in production.&nbsp;People are responsible for the consumption of far more water than they realise. The contrast in water use&nbsp;can be seen between continents. In Asia people consume about 1400 litres of virtual water every day, whereas&nbsp;in Europe and North America, people consume about 4000 litres each day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some countries such as Morocco, Jordan, Israel and Egypt have made the conscious decision to increase&nbsp;imports of products with high virtual water content and reduce their exports of such products. Countries&nbsp;such as these are short of adequate water supplies but would find it impractical to import supplies of real&nbsp;water for their needs, simply because the weight and volume would make it too expensive. However a&nbsp;country that chooses to become a net importer of virtual water, as opposed to real water, can relieve pressure&nbsp;on its own water resources. In many parts of the world subsidising water supply to farmers is commonplace,&nbsp;but one might seriously question whether this makes sense if the farmers use scarce water resources to&nbsp;produce crops with high virtual water content for export.<br>Given the increasing pressure on the world's supply of water it is clear that changes in food trade patterns&nbsp;based upon a consideration of the concept of virtual water could have a beneficial impact on economic&nbsp;welfare, despite the problems created as a result of the reallocation of. resources that this requires.<strong><br></strong></p>

<li style="text-align: left;">It is claimed that there is more than enough water for everyone's basic needs. What evidence is contained&nbsp;in the data to suggest that the 'looming water crisis' is created by demand side factors?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">The pollution resulting from marble cutting in Kishangarh is an example of a market failure. Discuss&nbsp;one policy that might be used to correct this market failure, and its likely effect on the water shortage.</li>

<li>Demand side factors did indeed create the problem of a 'looming water crisis' but&nbsp;supply side factors also played a role. Evidence in the data states that the world's&nbsp;population is expected to grow from 6 billion today to 8.9 billion in 2050. Global&nbsp;water consumption per person is also increasing as lifestyles are beginning to change.&nbsp;In the years 1990-1995 the usage has increased 6 times, making water usage faster&nbsp;than population growth itself. Therefore it can be concluded that water usage is the&nbsp;main demand side problem that is causing the crisis. Evidence from the data in figure 1&nbsp;shows us that in the agricultural, manufacturing and industrial sector, water usage&nbsp;is going up. Not only that, wastage of water in the domestic and industrial sector&nbsp;is very high. In the industrial sector, of all the water that is withdrawn, only 20%&nbsp;is used while the rest goes to waste. The case is the same in the domestic scene.&nbsp;Another demand side factor would be that 70% of the world's water usage goes&nbsp;to farming. Hence the demand per person for water would only increase as the&nbsp;problem is made worse due to the fact that more and more people are beginning&nbsp;to adopt western lifestyles and diets. Therefore, the evidence in the data does show&nbsp;to a great extent the 'looming water crisis' is caused by demand side factors.<br><br>But the problem is also due to the fact that the increase in supply has been hindered.&nbsp;On the whole, supply side development has been slow. The UN has estimated that&nbsp;the world needs US$1 billion to develop water resources and currently, there are&nbsp;not enough funds to do so. Also, ecological concerns have hindered water supply&nbsp;projects. Due to the higher level of pollution, the amount of usable water has decreased.&nbsp;Thus, it can be concluded that it is not all together demand side factors that have&nbsp;created the 'looming water crisis' but also supply side factors.<br><br></li>
<li>The main problem here is that demand for water is rising faster than supply of water.&nbsp;This is because farming requires a lot of water and on top of that, the population&nbsp;is rising. Also, in the growing marble cutting industry, there are 400 firms which&nbsp;use an average of 10,000 litres of water daily. The wasteful usage of water only&nbsp;adds on to the problem. From figure 1 in the data, it can be assumed that the actual&nbsp;consumption of water is probably 20%. In the supply side, the shortage of water&nbsp;is due to natural factors such as little rain. The people tend to depend entirely on&nbsp;groundwater in wells. Due to marble cutting, dust settles over the entire countryside,&nbsp;preventing rainwater from percolating into grounds. This too adds on to the water&nbsp;shortage problem.<br><br>The negative externality in this case is that the shortage of water has caused prices&nbsp;to go up and thus people have to pay more for water. In the commercial sector,&nbsp;as the price of water rises, people have to resort to buying from private resources.&nbsp;In doing so, they have to use transport and this wastes petrol which is a depletable&nbsp;resource. Also, marble cutting dust destroys the land's ability to store water underground.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c2ed892d809caf77754f402668dc31b9" alt="" width="469" height="251"><br><br>In this case, market cutting must be cut down to q<sub>s</sub> from q<sub>m</sub>.<br><br>Unfortunately, if rivers dry up this industry has to be stopped as there will be thirst&nbsp;and animal life will be affected if the trend continues. Eventually the marble industry&nbsp;would close down also.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/188611b2ce99351da9f919de4d4ce251" alt="" width="431" height="228"><br><br>In this case, market cutting must be banned completely as the social cost is just&nbsp;too high.<br><br>Hence, the solution would be to use more advanced technology in the industry. It&nbsp;is not possible to move the whole industry to another part of the country due to&nbsp;reasons such as high transport costs and the fact that mines are all located in that&nbsp;area. Figure 1 shows us that in industrial usage of water, the wastage is 80%. Thus&nbsp;making technology such as the jet spray technology more precise, accurate and&nbsp;making sure that water can be recycled through means of filtration would be possible&nbsp;solutions to correct the water shortage problem. Technology can also be used to&nbsp;redesign the factories so that dust does not leak out of the entire cutting factory.&nbsp;Making sure that there is no more open air cutting and that all cutting is done inhouse,&nbsp;with the workers wearing masks and goggles would ensure that the negative&nbsp;externality is reduced. This can be done through government regulations against open&nbsp;air cutting. The government can impose a pollution tax or quota on cutting. Tax&nbsp;incentives and grants can also be given out to buy new technology that reduces&nbsp;the amount of dust and water needed in the marble cutting industry. However, some&nbsp;problems can arise from this. Technological costs are very high, interest rates can&nbsp;be very high as well. The 400 firms in the industry would then suffer a loss in&nbsp;price competitiveness causing sales, profits and employment to fall. The shortage&nbsp;problem would probably be reduced but water shortage would generally still persist.&nbsp;But if technology is very effective and recycling is close to 100% then the problem&nbsp;may be solved and there would be enough water for people. Also, if alternative&nbsp;fluids can be used for cutting, even the lakes, which have dried up, may be revived.<br><br><br></li>
<li>The concept of virtual water is the water used to produce a good or product. Ultimately,&nbsp;there are 2 types of products in the world, namely high virtual water based&nbsp;products like rice farming and low virtual water based products like wheat farming.&nbsp;The former uses much more water than the latter for a ton of food.<br>In theory, the idea is a very good idea. The world must specialize in production&nbsp;based on water supply. Countries which are short of water like Egypt and Arab&nbsp;countries must go into low virtual water products and countries with abundant water&nbsp;supplies must move into production of high virtual water products. Market forces&nbsp;would lead to this trend eventually. Food production would then move out of the&nbsp;Middle East and the people would rather buy food from Canada who has abundant&nbsp;water. Thus we should not distort the market for agriculture production by subsidizing&nbsp;water. Currently there are governments who are doing this, giving the illusion&nbsp;of abundant water. This leads to more usage and wastage as production is not according&nbsp;to availability of water or virtual water based production.<br><br>By adopting the pattern of trade based upon the virtual water content of goods, there&nbsp;would be a reallocation of resources throughout the world as production patterns&nbsp;in many countries would have to change. The problem here though, is that cost of&nbsp;production depends on what countries produce which in turn depends on the science&nbsp;and technology used, labor costs and productivity and cost of raw materials. Water&nbsp;is only 1 factor of production and may not be a major factor. What if Canada has&nbsp;abundant water but labor and land are expensive? Or what if Egypt has no water&nbsp;but cheap land and labor? Comparative advantage mav still be there in a countrv&nbsp;for whatever production due to the other costs of production that are low. If market&nbsp;forces are to prevail, production in the world will not be based on the concept of&nbsp;virtual water. We may need government intervention to direct production based on&nbsp;the virtual water concept.<br><br>To base production on the concept of virtual water would also lead to other problems.&nbsp;Countries may end up being overspecialized instead of being well diversified. This&nbsp;would compromise on economic security and stability of that nation. Also, there&nbsp;may not be enough low virtual water industries to go around all countries. This&nbsp;is because most industries are high virtual water industries (tourism and manufacturing).&nbsp;Almost all industries need water and so while the idea of trade based on&nbsp;virtual water content is good, the option ceases to exist in reality. Also this would&nbsp;create structural unemployment. For example in the Middle East, if agriculture is&nbsp;abandoned, what are the farmers going to do? They are occupationally immobile&nbsp;and can't go into the manufacturing industry. Thus the concept of production and&nbsp;trade based on virtual water is highly theoretical.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Extract 1 The Troubled German Economy<br></strong>Fifteen years after West and East Germany were reunited, people on both sides of the divide are still paying&nbsp;for the change. In the western part of the new Germany taxes are spent on supporting those less well off&nbsp;in the east, where unemployment is sometimes as high as 20%. Once the powerhouse of the European&nbsp;economy, Germany is now faced by very slow growth rates compared to other European economies. In&nbsp;the late 1990s it grew by only 1.6% a year, a full percentage point less than the European Union average.&nbsp;Since 2000, it has barely expanded at all.<br>One problem caused by reunification was that trade unions representing workers in the east won the right&nbsp;to the same social benefits, such as unemployment benefits, as those in the west. They also secured substantial&nbsp;pay rises. However, many of these workers in the east worked in overmanned, inefficient factories,&nbsp;so increased wages made production costs painfully high and caused redundancies, which pushed unemployment&nbsp;up to over 4 million. It was left to taxpayers in the west to foot the bill for unemployment benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Extract 2 Singapore Economy in Growth Spurt<br></strong>Singapore's economy grew at a rate of 12.5% in the three months to June from the same period a year&nbsp;earlier. It is the fastest quarterly expansion in a decade, and confirms the country's status as one of Asia's&nbsp;fastest growing economies. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) now forecast growth of between&nbsp;8% and 9% for the whole year, putting Singapore on a par with China, the fastest growing economy in&nbsp;Asia.</p>

<li>The APC measures consumption as a parentage of income. For Singapore it was&nbsp;42% in 2003, and for Germany it was 57%.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The uncompetitiveness of workers and industries in the former East Germany,&nbsp;has put a heavy burden on the rest of Germany. Workers in East Germany are&nbsp;unproductive. Resources have to be diverted to support high levels of unemployment&nbsp;in the East.</li>
<li>A micro supply-side program to retrain workers in the East to raise their productivity levels. Workers with redundant skills and workers in relevant industries; but with low productivity; must be made to attend full-time course. They&nbsp;must be financially supported while doing so.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Extract 1&nbsp;suggests that Germany was in recession in the 2000s; since it had barely&nbsp;expanded at all. Therefore it is the Germans who would not be spending and, in&nbsp;tum, not buying imports. However exports would be performing as normal. Therefore&nbsp;an improving surplus in the export trade.<br>Of course the East German problem may have a negative effect; but it makes up less than 20% of the German economy. West German products are still competitive&nbsp;world-wide.</li>
<li>Singapore is a very open economy; with exports being 150-200% of GDP. Its growth&nbsp;depends on external demand. Thus, when the world economy was slowing down&nbsp;in 2002-03; Singapore production also slowed down. Therefore, new investments&nbsp;also slowed-down. Probably Singapore was having a lot of spare capacity.<br>The German economy depends on internal demands. Its exports are not as high as&nbsp;Singapore's (as a % of GDP). Germany was in recession. Actual production fell&nbsp;in 2003. Therefore there was no need for new investments. Although real investments&nbsp;did increase from 2002 to 2003, it was a small one, being lower than in 2000-01.</li>
<li>Injections are autonomous increases in expenditures. They are government spending;&nbsp;exports and investments. For Singapore, over the period given, these have all increased&nbsp;as a whole. The injections will work on the multiplier which will increase the national&nbsp;income by a greater amount.<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ca15588587ef00fd1dc842e06ebca4aa" alt="" width="385" height="169"><br>GDP increases due to increase in injections. The higher income will give a higher&nbsp;standard of living and more employment. Singapore is a very open economy; and&nbsp;therefore, the leakages are equally high. Singapore's propensity to import is high&nbsp;due to our high degree of specialisation. Savings are high due to CPF (Compulsory&nbsp;savings). These make the value of the multiplier (k) smaller as:<br>k = 1/(mpm&nbsp;+ mps + mpt)<br>In conclusion, the impact of injections would be quite limited in Singapore.<br>Another possibility is that the injections would be inflationary. If we assume that&nbsp;Singapore is near its potential output, then the AD increases faster than the output;&nbsp;causing prices to rise.<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/906796e676a3f144008c3f76baef1bfa" alt="" width="355" height="170"><br>Price rise due to the shortage of resources.

<p style="text-align: left;">White sugar can be processed from either of two types of raw material: sugar beet, which is grown extensively&nbsp;in the UK and other European Union countries, and sugar cane, which is grown only outside the EU.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">British Sugar (BSC) is a firm in an enviable position. As the sole processor of the sugar beet grown in&nbsp;the UK, it enjoys a large share of the market for refined white sugar. In addition it receives a guaranteed&nbsp;price from the EU for the sugar it produces.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tate and Lyle is a company that also processes sugar in the UK, but uses sugar cane, which is imported&nbsp;from countries outside the European Union such as Brazil, Australia and the Caribbean countries. Imports&nbsp;of sugar cane are limited by quotas, which restrict the supply and ensure that BSC faces little competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Neither BSC nor Tate and Lyle has any incentive to cut prices since there can be no resulting increase&nbsp;in sales, as quotas limit increases in production. BSC has its production quota set by the Common Agricultural&nbsp;Policy of the European Union, while Tate and Lyle's ability to increase sales is limited by the sugar cane&nbsp;import quota. The EU subsidises the export of all surplus sugar and this helps to keep prices in the world&nbsp;market low.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the past BSC has more than once been found guilty of abusing its market power. It has twice been&nbsp;fined by the EU, on the first occasion for blocking the entry of another firm into the market, and later&nbsp;for colluding and price fixing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">BSC's profits have exceeded 20% in every year but one since 1994. In 2001, the margin was 21 % compared&nbsp;to the overall profit margin of its parent company (Associated British Foods) of just 6%. It has been&nbsp;estimated that if the guaranteed price were reduced by 11 %, profits of 10% could still be earned. The&nbsp;reduction would transfer 123m euros from the company to its consumers.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4ce220b13d7f3ec1974bc685fc6ec5f2" alt="" width="611" height="314"></p>

<li>The EU prices were about double the world price for the whole period. It also&nbsp;remained constant for long periods before falling marginally. The world price&nbsp;fluctuated within a 200 cents margin.</li>
<li>Firstly, the world price is lower, possibly, due to freer market forces. This&nbsp;explains the moderate fluctuations as well. The EU price is set by regulation.&nbsp;Its production is also affected by government regulation.</li>
<li>Firstly, BSC controls the entire supply of beet, the vegetable needed for sugar&nbsp;production. Secondly, BSC has a very large share of the UK market.</li>
<li>It could be brand loyalty. BSC has been there for decades. It is a trusted brand.&nbsp;It has a good rapport with the public, having contributed to charities and national&nbsp;causes.

<li>Refer to the diagram below that shows the market structure of a typical monopoly.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/14f848a004846aa426ac417e1e5276e7" alt="" width="401" height="198"><br><br>The monopoly produces mere P &gt; MC (no allocative efficiency). Therefore the price&nbsp;is P<sub>m</sub> and quantity q<sub>m</sub>. The consumer surplus is only P<sub>m</sub>ae, the producer surplus is&nbsp;P<sub>m</sub>efd.<br><br>In a competitive situation, equilibrium would be at P<sub>c</sub> and q<sub>c</sub> (where P = MC).&nbsp;Consumer surplus would be greater: abP<sub>c</sub>. The monopoly takes over P<sub>m</sub>ebP<sub>c</sub>. The&nbsp;shaded areas are deadweight losses of consumer surplus and producer surplus.</li>
<li>Initially the demand was D<sub>0</sub>, the price P<sub>0</sub> and quantity q<sub>0</sub>. There was supernormal&nbsp;profit (shaded area).<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/76864c4874dfed00150dd58b4df366f2" alt="" width="422" height="225"><br><br>When new firms enter, the demand for BSC will fall drastically to D<sub>1</sub> (foreign price&nbsp;is half). BSC makes a loss because price is now P<sub>1</sub> but cost is C<sub>1</sub> at output q<sub>1</sub>.</li>
<li>Refer to the diagram below that shows the typical long run equilibrium of a monopoly&nbsp;making supernormal profits.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a5f856e757c55d46f80ebeb741449526" alt="" width="397" height="200"><br><br>Often, it is argued that the monopoly market structure is not in the public interest.&nbsp;At its equilibrium point, it can be seen that the price P<sub>0</sub> at this output q<sub>0</sub> is higher&nbsp;than the MC. In economic terms, it is called allocative inefficiency. It means that&nbsp;output is not at the level where society's satisfaction can be maximised, from the&nbsp;consumption of this good. As long as what people pay (the price that represents&nbsp;the satisfaction consumer desire) is greater than the cost of producing the last unit,&nbsp;the market is not efficient. It is only when output is at the level where P = MC&nbsp;then there is allocative efficiency. Therefore, in this case, output should have been&nbsp;at Oq<sub>1</sub> and price at OP<sub>1</sub>. The monopoly will make a smaller profit.<br><br>The socially ideal output level is where P = MC. Because the monopoly is the only&nbsp;seller, which stands a better chance of making profits. It knows that profits can only&nbsp;be made at the expense of consumers, he creates a shortage so that price rises faster&nbsp;than AC. The difference between the two is the profit margin. It is only in a perfectly&nbsp;competitive market situation that one has allocative efficiency. Competition forces&nbsp;prices down till output will be at the point where P = MC. However, in all the&nbsp;imperfect markets - oligopoly, monopolistic competitive and monopoly, where will&nbsp;be various degrees of allocative inefficiency, depending on the level of competition.<br><br>Another reason why the monopoly does not produce at the socially optimum level&nbsp;is because output is not at the productively efficient level. Referring to above diagram,&nbsp;output is on the sloping left side of the AC curve and not at its minimum. The&nbsp;firm is with excess capacity where allocated resources are not fully utilised. In a&nbsp;competitive situation output would be at the lowest AC. It is socially ideal to produce&nbsp;at optimum capacity.<br><br>It is not always the case that society loses out when monopoly exist. When monopoly&nbsp;exist, it is true that they are allocatively and productively inefficient, but this does&nbsp;not mean that they are less efficient than firms in other market structures, particularly&nbsp;a perfectly competitive market. This is because a monopoly can enjoy economies&nbsp;of scale (EOS) that firms in other market situations may not. The monopoly enjoys&nbsp;EOS because it is the only supplier in the market. Refer to the diagram below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/29230b158ad85a7e54c7d53af2c73578" alt="" width="388" height="177"><br><br>The monopoly has an option of either mass producing to enjoy EOS as shown by&nbsp;monopoly firm 2 or to drastically cut output as shown by monopoly firm 1. Monopoly&nbsp;firm 2 enjoys EOS and produces at output level Oq<sub>3</sub>. At this level it still makes&nbsp;supernormal profit as shown, but its price, MC and AC are still lower than the firm&nbsp;in Perfect Competition. The firm in perfect competition makes only normal profits, but its price, MC&nbsp;and AC are higher than Monopoly 2. Its output is also lower. The perfect competition is by definition&nbsp;efficient but consumers are better off with Monopoly 2. This is because firms&nbsp;perfect competition may not enjoy EOS. Too many firms are sharing a relatively small market.<br><br>It is only when a monopoly chooses to be at the output level of Monopoly 1, in&nbsp;this case the monopoly's prices, MC and AC are higher than the perfect competition and its output&nbsp;is lower. Consumers are worse off.<br><br>For certain industries, it is better to have a monopoly or near monopoly market&nbsp;situation. This is because there may be a need for the few or one firm to enjoy&nbsp;EOS. This enables the price to be affordable to consumers and profits to be made&nbsp;at the same time. Alternatively, there may be no output at all. Some monopolies&nbsp;have very high fixed costs. Competition will cause them to make losses. It is better&nbsp;to have production of a good being sold at a high price than to have none at all.&nbsp;Monopolies are in a better position to undertake research and development. Consumers,&nbsp;as a result, will enjoy new products and accessories. New technology leads&nbsp;to a more efficient use of limited resources. Thus monopolies are not necessarily&nbsp;bad.</li>

<li>Terms of trade (TOT) is the ratio of average price of&nbsp;a county's exports to the average price of its imports.&nbsp;It, therefore, measures the rate at which the goods of&nbsp;one country exchange for the goods of another. In real&nbsp;world the TOT are represented as an index of the ratio&nbsp;of export prices and import prices:<br>TOT = (Index of export prices)/(Index of imports prices)&nbsp;× 100<br>The ratio is calculated from the average prices of many&nbsp;thousands of goods which are traded with the rest of the&nbsp;world. In relation to the terms of trade, index incorporates&nbsp;weights which are attached to each good and&nbsp;service based on their relative importance in total exports&nbsp;and total imports.<br>Official statistics show the terms of trade as a single&nbsp;index in relation to a given base year. For instance, if&nbsp;year 0 has a base year index of 100 and in year 1 the&nbsp;index stands at 104.2 then it implies that on average the&nbsp;country is receiving relatively better prices for its&nbsp;exports than it is having to pay to other countries for&nbsp;its imports. In this case the terms of trade have&nbsp;improved. In contrast to this the value of terms of trade&nbsp;index 97.5 in year 1 means that on average the country&nbsp;is having to pay a relatively higher price for its imports&nbsp;than it is receiving for its own exports. In this case&nbsp;terms of trade have deteriorated. Care must be taken&nbsp;when interpreting the terms of trade. A favourable&nbsp;movement does not necessarily imply a value of over&nbsp;100, but simply an improvement on the previous year's&nbsp;value. Similarly a deterioration simply refers to a decline&nbsp;in its value.<br>Exchange rate on the other hand is the price of a country's&nbsp;currency in terms of another country's currency. It&nbsp;usually changes due to the fluctuations in the forces of&nbsp;demand and supply of a currency in the foreign&nbsp;exchange market. A declining exchange rate has a detrimental&nbsp;effect on a country's term of trade. Depreciation&nbsp;means that more units of a country's currency are&nbsp;required than before to obtain the same units of another&nbsp;country's currency. When this happens it effectively&nbsp;decreases the prices of its exports in foreign currency&nbsp;and at the same time increases the prices of its imports&nbsp;in local currency. In that case terms of trade of the&nbsp;country worsens.<br>Unlike a decline in exchange rate a high rate of inflation&nbsp;may potentially improve a country's terms of trade.&nbsp;The term inflation refers to a persistent and generalized&nbsp;increase in the price level of an economy. A high rate of&nbsp;inflation when it causes prices of a country's exports to&nbsp;increase could bring a favourable movement in its terms&nbsp;of trade. It, however, depends on the relative rate of&nbsp;inflation i.e inflation rate in a country compared to the&nbsp;rate in other countries with which it trades. When, for&nbsp;instance, a country's rate of inflation is relatively higher&nbsp;than its trading partners' its terms of trade is likely to&nbsp;improve. Conversely, when the rate of inflation in a&nbsp;country is considered high but it is relatively lower than&nbsp;its trading partners then terms of trade may worsen.&nbsp;The effects of rising export prices on a country's terms&nbsp;trade, therefore, depend on the relative rate of inflation.<br>It, therefore, follows that a declining exchange rate causes&nbsp;a TOT of a county to worsen while high rate of inflation&nbsp;may improve it.</li>
<li>A fall in an economy's terms of trade could result from&nbsp;various combinations of changes in prices of its imports&nbsp;and exports. It may, for instance, result from a rise in&nbsp;import prices when export prices either decrease or&nbsp;remain stagnant. This could also result from a decrease&nbsp;in export prices where import prices either rise or&nbsp;remain unchanged, Whatever combination of changes in&nbsp;prices of export and imports causes a fall in a country's&nbsp;terms of trade the result is that price of exports on&nbsp;average has fallen relative to the average price of imports.<br>So, from a fall in terms of trade it follows that the&nbsp;country's exports are now more competitive and therefore&nbsp;its export volume should increase. At the same time&nbsp;the country's imports have become relatively expensive&nbsp;that should reduce its import volumes. Rising exports&nbsp;may require export reliant industries to expand their&nbsp;output levels and therefore create more employment&nbsp;opportunities for unemployed resources. Simultaneously&nbsp;a decrease in imports may result in an increasing&nbsp;demand for domestic goods leading to even more job&nbsp;creation. The combined effect of these can be viewed as&nbsp;rising aggregate demand that could result in demand pull&nbsp;inflation particularly if supply-side is less responsive to&nbsp;changes in the price level. Also the rising demand for&nbsp;resources may cause their prices to increase and could&nbsp;translate into cost push inflation.<br>So far as the country's net earnings from its trade is&nbsp;concerned it is subject to the price elasticity of demand&nbsp;for exports and imports. The importance of these&nbsp;elasticities of demand is generalized in the Marshall learner&nbsp;condition. This implies that a fall in terms of&nbsp;trade will lead to an improvement in an economy's trade&nbsp;balance only if the sum of price elasticity of demand for&nbsp;its exports and imports is greater than unity i.e. elastic.&nbsp;This can be illustrated with reference to the figures below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b9948e28dc999008fc69b1eb8793275c" alt="" width="303" height="256"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0f2bebf49b755071721090e8c2247cb6" alt="" width="301" height="267"><br><br>In figure (a) a fall in the foreign price of exports from&nbsp;P to P<sub>1</sub> causes an increase in demand for exports from&nbsp;X to X<sub>1</sub>. Given the elastic demand for exports, this will&nbsp;lead to a reduction in export earnings by area A, but at&nbsp;the same time there will be an increase in exports earnings&nbsp;by the area B. Since the larger proportionate change&nbsp;in quantity demanded outweighs the smaller proportionate&nbsp;fall in price, therefore, it results in an increase in&nbsp;export earnings by (B - A).<br>ln figure (b) an increase in the price of imports in local&nbsp;currency from P to P<sub>1</sub> reduces their demand from M to&nbsp;M<sub>1</sub> . This leads to an increase in expenditure on imports&nbsp;by the area C but a reduction in expenditure of area D.&nbsp;Thus there is an overall reduction in expenditure on&nbsp;imports of (C - D) because the demand for imports is&nbsp;elastic. In terms of trade balance, the effect will have&nbsp;been improvement of (B - A) + (C - D).<br>So long as the elasticity conditions are favourable, a fall&nbsp;in terms of trade will improve the country's balance of&nbsp;trade position. However, elasticity conditions are&nbsp;unlikely to be favourable in the short run. It takes time&nbsp;for people to adjust their patterns of consumption; therefore,&nbsp;foreign currency spending on imports is largely&nbsp;unchanged. On the other hand foreign currency earnings&nbsp;fall because much the same volume of exports is sold&nbsp;at lower price in foreign currency. Hence initially the&nbsp;trade balance deteriorates before it starts improving. This&nbsp;is usually referred to as the 'J' curve effect as shown&nbsp;in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b5a20aca106aaa035f73aac10245e9bf" alt="" width="357" height="192"><br><br>Let's assume that a fall in terms of trade occurs at a time&nbsp;when the economy is at point A. Initially the trade deficit&nbsp;worsens, as indicated by a movement from point A to&nbsp;B. After a while, however, the trade deficit starts to fall&nbsp;and eventually a surplus could be obtained as indicated&nbsp;by point C.<br>In conclusion the overall effects of a fall in a country's&nbsp;terms of trade depend on many different factors such&nbsp;as price elasticity of demand and supply for exports&nbsp;and price elasticity of demand for imports.</li>

Thus the individuals who make decision about how much to consume do not fully appreciate the benefits of goods such as education and health care. Moreover, these goods create a divergence between the private benefits and social benefits of production and consumption, therefore result in a risk of market failure. The essence of merit goods is to do with a failure of information to the consumer and spillover effects on non-consumers. As a consequence free market forces would not provide them in the quantities that society ought to consume. i.e. socially optimum level. This is illustrated in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/97b1dbad02ea05106858a4dc9b4b4055" alt="" width="413" height="294"><br><br>Here the correct level of demand, if consumers fully appreciated the true value of the product, is D<sub>1</sub> (social benefit). This leads to a market price of P<sub>1</sub>, where marginal social benefits equal marginal social costs (supply curve). This price is associated with the socially optimum level of production and consumption of Q<sub>1</sub>. However, since consumers undervalue the product, therefore D<sub>2</sub> demand is registered. This leads to a market price of P<sub>2</sub> and production and consumption of Q<sub>2</sub>. This is below the optimum level, hence market has allocated insufficient amount of resources for the production of this good and, therefore resulted in welfare loss as shown by the shaded triangular area.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate welfare loss, a government may adopt various policies ranging from subsidies, educational campaigns regulation to state provision in order to increase their consumption.</p>
<p>A provision of producer subsidy is most commonly used measure for this purpose. A producer subsidy is transfer of money from government to firms. Since it is usually in the form of cost sharing, therefore, it increases profitability of producers and hence encourages them to increase their output. So a subsidy to producers shifts their supply curve to the right and therefore may result in higher consumption. The effect of subsidy is shown on the following graph.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/23c9c61d279e983caf072a3f80a90343" alt="" width="301" height="220"></p>
<p>Vertical distance between S and S + subsidy (S - P<sub>1</sub>) measures per unit subsidy. It can be noted that the effect of subsidy is to reduce the price from P to P<sub>1</sub> and increase the consumption from q to q<sub>1</sub>. Market price, however, does not fall by the full amount of subsidy, because the demand curve is downward sloping. So, the benefit of subsidy is distributed between consumers and producers. Consumers benefit from a decrease in price from P to P<sub>1</sub> while producers receive the remaining amount (P - S) and the total expenditure of subsidy to the government can be measured as per unit subsidy (S - P<sub>1</sub>) multiplied by the new equilibrium quantity (q<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p>Most importantly a subsidy has increased consumption to the socially optimum level of q<sub>1</sub>. However, the extent to which it improves output and consumption depends on price elasticity of demand and supply. If, for instance, either PED or PES is inelastic then a heavy amount of subsidy may not be justified by a relatively smaller change in consumption. Moreover, in order to raise finances, either the government has to shift funds from elsewhere or can raise funds through additional taxes. In both cases the government action could undermine welfare elsewhere. In the former case it could involve sacrificing benefits from other welfare projects and in the latter case additional taxes could exert extra burden on tax payers' pockets. In addition to this a subsidy is not a preferred measure if it takes a considerably long time to come into effect and eventually have an impact on consumption. It is also believed that in most cases a subsidy results in producers to lose the initiative to improve their efficiency levels.</p>
<p>It, therefore, follows that owing to information failure a merit good is under-supplied in a free market economy. The government, therefore, needs to intervene to improve their supplies and consumption. In order to do so it is required to weigh up cost and benefits of alternative measures and adopt the one that is most effective in the given conditions.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 213</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8753</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Using examples, explain the difference between merit&nbsp;goods and public goods and show why it is possible for&nbsp;profit to be made in the supply of one of these types&nbsp;of good but not the other.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Goods or services, which are indivisible, and to which the&nbsp;exclusion principle does not apply are classified as public&nbsp;goods. These goods can be jointly consumed by many&nbsp;individuals at no additional cost. The classic examples&nbsp;of public goods are street lights and national defense.&nbsp;On the other hand, a merit good is defined as a good that&nbsp;is better for a person than the person who may&nbsp;consume the good realizes. Thus the individuals who&nbsp;make decision about how much to consume do not fully&nbsp;appreciate the benefits of merit goods. Moreover, these&nbsp;goods are often associated with positive extenalities as&nbsp;it is believed that they create a divergence between the&nbsp;private and social benefits. Good examples of merit goods&nbsp;include health care services, education, work training&nbsp;programmes, public libraries etc.<br>Public goods possess two distinguishing characteristics&nbsp;i.e. they are non-excludible and non-rival.<br>Non-excludability entails that once these goods come&nbsp;into existence there is no effective way of restricting&nbsp;their benefits to only those who pay for them. Whilst&nbsp;non-rivalry means as more and more people consume&nbsp;these goods; the benefits to those already consuming are&nbsp;not diminished.<br>These two features give rise to the free rider problem;&nbsp;people receiving benefits from a good without contributing&nbsp;to its cost. It entails a situation in which everyone&nbsp;believes that others will take on the burden of payment&nbsp;and as a result no one will be willing to pay for them.&nbsp;So, there is no effective demand registered in the market&nbsp;and hence there is no economic incentive for private&nbsp;enterprises to supply them. Therefore it is held that the&nbsp;market forces fail to allocate resources for such goods.<br>Merit goods, on the contrary, are classified as private&nbsp;goods because they are characterized with excludability&nbsp;and rivalry. Excludability entails that there is an effective&nbsp;way of excluding individuals who are unwilling or&nbsp;unable to pay; therefore it is possible to charge a market&nbsp;price. A health care provider, for instance, can charge a&nbsp;price for his services from individual patients with&nbsp;different health issues. Those unable or unwilling to pay&nbsp;cannot benefit from his services. Rivalry means as more&nbsp;and more people consume the product; the quantity&nbsp;available to others is reduced. It means when a doctor&nbsp;is busy giving treatment to one patient his services at&nbsp;that point in time are not available to others.<br>Thus an effective demand for these goods is registered&nbsp;in the market in that people who are able to pay they&nbsp;are also willing to pay when they need these goods.&nbsp;Thus, there is an economic incentive for private enterprises&nbsp;to produce and supply them through the market.&nbsp;However, due to a lack of information consumers may&nbsp;not feel the need to consume them up to the correct&nbsp;level i.e. socially optimum level. Therefore it is held that&nbsp;the free market forces would not provide them in the&nbsp;quantities that society ought to consume.<br>It, therefore, follows that merit goods, unlike public&nbsp;goods, are produced and provided by the market forces&nbsp;but the society judges that they would not be consumed&nbsp;to the correct level.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 214</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8752</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>Income elasticity of demand (YED) is the responsiveness&nbsp;of demand for a product to changes in income. The&nbsp;coefficient of YED is measured by the following.<br><br>YED = (Percentage change in the quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in the income)<br><br>So, the coefficient of YED tells us what the percentage&nbsp;change in the quantity demanded for a good is following&nbsp;a given change in the income of the consumer. These&nbsp;percentage changes are calculated by dividing the change&nbsp;in income by the original income and the change in&nbsp;quantity demanded by the original quantity demanded.<br>Regardless of sign when the coefficient of YED&gt; 1,&nbsp;demand is said to be income elastic. This is the case&nbsp;when the percentage change in quantity demanded&nbsp;outweighs the percentage change in income. When,&nbsp;however, coefficient of YED &lt; 1, demand is said to be&nbsp;income inelastic. In that case percentage change in&nbsp;income outweighs percentage change in demand. Demand&nbsp;is unitary elastic when proportionate changes in demand&nbsp;and income are identical. There may be a case of zero&nbsp;income elastic demand. It is when a change in income&nbsp;has no effect whatsoever on the quantity demanded.&nbsp;With income elasticity of demand the sign attached the&nbsp;ratio is all important. A plus sign (+) signifies a normal&nbsp;good whereas a minus sign (-) reveals that the good in&nbsp;question is 'inferior'. For most goods the coefficient of&nbsp;YED is positive i.e. demand for a normal good always&nbsp;rises with income. The negative coefficient, however,&nbsp;suggests that demand falls as income rises or it rises&nbsp;when income falls. Consumers, for instance, decrease&nbsp;the purchase of goods, such as used clothes, as their&nbsp;incomes rise. Following graph illustrates this negative&nbsp;income effect on an inferior good.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/093198752eec07d211b6c0f7bad310bb" alt="" width="297" height="190"><br>On the vertical axis changes in expenditure signify&nbsp;changes in demand resulting from a change in income&nbsp;measured on the horizontal axis . A rise in income, for&nbsp;instance, from Y to Y<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;causes consumers to reduce their&nbsp;purchases as indicated by a fall in expenditure from E&nbsp;to E<sub>1</sub>. This is because they can now afford to switch&nbsp;to what they believe to be a relatively better substitute&nbsp;that they prefer to this good. Similarly a decrease in&nbsp;income reduces their affordability and, therefore, forces&nbsp;them to switch to this relatively cheaper or what they&nbsp;believe to be as an inferior substitute and that causes&nbsp;their spending on inferior good to rise. This inverse&nbsp;relationship between income and expenditure produces&nbsp;a negatively sloping income consumption curve for an inferior good.<br><br></li>
<li>Economists define PED as a numerical measure of the&nbsp;sensitivity of quantity demanded of a product to change&nbsp;in product's own price. Economists measure the degree&nbsp;of PED as;<br><br>Ed = (Percentage change in the quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in the price product)<br><br>PED coefficient tells us the percentage change in the&nbsp;quantity demanded for a good following a given change&nbsp;in the price of that good. Negative coefficient of PED&nbsp;suggests the negative slope of a normal demand curve.&nbsp;However, it is normally the convention to ignore the&nbsp;negative sign and concentrate on the value of the figure.<br><br>All governments use taxation and expenditure as tools&nbsp;to pursue certain goals as part of their economic policy.&nbsp;They rely on a combination of direct and indirect taxation&nbsp;to raise the necessary funds for their expenditure&nbsp;and in some cases to influence production and consumption&nbsp;of various goods as part of their economic policy.&nbsp;Concepts of price elasticity and income elasticity of&nbsp;demand can be useful to work out effectiveness of taxation&nbsp;and expenditure relative to their goals.<br><br>Indirect taxes are levied on purchases of goods and&nbsp;services. Regardless of who pays them, the producers&nbsp;or consumers, a government can figure out the effects&nbsp;of changing their rates on its tax revenue and consumption.&nbsp;Consider the graphs below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5fd7aad79a10a511b92d0bac1650268c" alt="" width="414" height="217"><br><br>Figures above illustrate this in a simplified form by shifting&nbsp;the supply curves to the left. In both cases let's&nbsp;assume the market price is $30 that already includes a&nbsp;tax of $10. If the government raises tax from $10 to $20&nbsp;it shifts the supply curves leftwards by $10 and therefore&nbsp;causes the market prices to increase. Now tax revenue&nbsp;changes from $30 to $20 where demand is relatively&nbsp;elastic but increases from $100 to $180 where demand is&nbsp;relatively inelastic. Therefore if the government is trying&nbsp;to raise more revenue it should increase taxes on those&nbsp;products that have inelastic demand. If, however, it were&nbsp;to increase the tax revenue on those products with&nbsp;elastic demand the money collected would actually&nbsp;decline.<br><br>So far as the objective of restricting consumption of&nbsp;demerit goods is concerned raising an indirect tax is more&nbsp;effective when demand is elastic because any given&nbsp;proportionate increase in price causes a larger proportionate&nbsp;fall in quantity demanded. So the government&nbsp;can use the concept of price elasticity of demand to&nbsp;figure out by how much tax on such goods to be raised&nbsp;in order to restrict their consumption to a certain level.<br><br>An increase in indirect tax effectively reduces people's&nbsp;real income as it forces them to spend more on goods&nbsp;with low price elasticity. Thus in effect it reduces their&nbsp;affordability to buy other goods and services. This is&nbsp;where the concept of income elasticity of demand proves&nbsp;to be useful because it can help the government to&nbsp;analyze changing patterns of demand. An increase in&nbsp;indirect tax on fuel, for instance, may force the people&nbsp;to spend more on buying fuel therefore they might cut&nbsp;down their demand for other goods. The magnitude of&nbsp;this effect can be calculated by using the coefficient of&nbsp;income elasticity of demand. Moreover, changing rates&nbsp;of indirect taxes can affect the rate of inflation, employment&nbsp;and income inequalities. The extent to which all of&nbsp;these take effect, however, depends on price elasticity&nbsp;of demand for the goods subject to higher indirect taxes.<br><br>A subsidy is a negative tax that means it has exact&nbsp;opposite effect of an indirect tax. When government&nbsp;subsidizes a good the objective may be to increase&nbsp;production and consumption of a merit good or to&nbsp;redistribute incomes in favour of relatively poor people&nbsp;by reducing their expenditure on some essential good. In&nbsp;both cases price elasticity of demand helps the government&nbsp;to assess the extent to which a subsidy causes a&nbsp;fall in price and increase in consumption. If, for instance,&nbsp;the objective is to raise consumption than subsidy is&nbsp;more effective where demand for a good is elastic, this&nbsp;is because a subsidy will reduce the price and therefore&nbsp;will result in proportionately larger increase in consumption.&nbsp;If, however, the objective is to reduce people&nbsp;expenditure on a good then it proves effective where&nbsp;demand is inelastic.<br><br>A government may also use the concept of income&nbsp;elasticity of demand to figure out the effects of changing&nbsp;income tax rates on consumption of various products&nbsp;and different regions. Since a change in tax rate causes&nbsp;a change in people's disposable incomes that in return&nbsp;affects their affordability and hence demand for various&nbsp;goods and services.<br><br>To begin with let's assume the government increases&nbsp;standard rates of income tax with the view to collect&nbsp;more revenue. This in effect will reduce people's&nbsp;disposable incomes that might result in an increase in&nbsp;demand for inferior goods and a decrease in demand for&nbsp;normal goods. It means that the businesses and regions&nbsp;specializing in producing inferior goods may have an&nbsp;increase in their sales and therefore benefit in terms of&nbsp;higher incomes. Businesses and regions specializing in&nbsp;normal goods may have a decrease in their revenues and&nbsp;hence incomes. By how much it affects different regions&nbsp;and businesses can be calculated by using coefficient of&nbsp;income elasticity of demand. Similarly a policy to&nbsp;reduce income tax rates would have opposite impact.&nbsp;Therefore it helps government to analyze the changes in&nbsp;demand for income sensitive goods and their effects on&nbsp;earnings and employment in those industries.<br><br>From the above discussion it follows that the concepts&nbsp;of price and income elasticity of demand prove to be&nbsp;highly useful for economic management as they help the&nbsp;government to forecast changes resulting from its&nbsp;taxation and expenditure policy in the economy. Price&nbsp;elasticity of demand, however, seems more useful due&nbsp;its wider impact on the economy.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past decade, Brazil boomed and grew rich by selling raw materials to China. Brazil’s&nbsp;economy averaged 3.6% annual growth, peaking at a rate of 7.5% in 2010. Its currency, the&nbsp;Brazilian Real, substantially increased in value.<br>By comparison, Mexico saw lower growth, partly because it was tied to a faltering United States&nbsp;(US) economy. Mexico also suffered from deep problems of its own, for example, a poor education&nbsp;system and a rise in violent crime, deterring tourists and investors. Mexico’s economy averaged&nbsp;2.6% annual growth over the past decade, while its currency, the Mexican Peso, fell slightly in&nbsp;value.<br>From 2011, it was Brazil’s turn to struggle as China’s demand for its raw materials decreased. In&nbsp;2013 alone, Brazil’s currency depreciated by more than 10%. The Brazilian Government largely&nbsp;wasted the boom years, investing little in roads and other infrastructure that could have supported&nbsp;its development. In addition, many households borrowed money to finance a consumer boom&nbsp;including a rapid rise in imports of luxuries from the US. As a result, a significant trade deficit in&nbsp;goods and services developed.<br>Meanwhile, the Mexican Government used the past decade to significantly strengthen its economy,&nbsp;improving the education system and making its telecommunications, financial and energy sectors&nbsp;more efficient. Economists now expect the country to grow more rapidly when Mexico’s biggest&nbsp;trading partner, the US, recovers economically. Also, Mexico exports manufactured goods to a&nbsp;growing European market. At the same time, Mexico has maintained a relatively small trade deficit&nbsp;that can be financed easily by long-term foreign investment in its companies and factories.<br>Source: The Wall Street Journal, September 2013</p>

<li><img src="./AL Econ_files/0f88a98c6182c0c4d67a3ef22084cf1c" alt="" width="341" height="248"><br>Brazilian economy has grown from $0.5 trillion in 2003 to $2.5 trillion in 2013. The graph above depicts&nbsp;this growth by an outward shift in the Brazilian PPC.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Despite a fall in its value after 2011 the Brazilian Real had appreciated by approximately 25% between 2004&nbsp;and 2013.</li>
<li>Stability of the Mexican Peso during the period might have resulted from a deliberate attempt by the&nbsp;Mexican monetary authorities to influence demand and supply of Peso in the forex market. When, for&nbsp;instance, Peso was likely to depreciate the authorities might have used their US Dollar reserves to buy&nbsp;excess supply of Peso and thus prevented depreciation. Similarly when there was a buying pressure on&nbsp;Peso, in order to prevent its rise they must have sold Peso with the view to eliminate its shortage.</li>
<li>The changes in the currency values are a reflection of changes in the supply and demand for the Brazilian&nbsp;Real and the Mexican Peso. In Brazil, for instance, a significant trade deficit in goods and services developed.&nbsp;It means that the supply of Real exceeded its demand as shown in the graph below.<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/127d61d8d0d28b9200ea4f680ffe054b" alt="" width="545" height="217"><br>As given in the text, a decline in China's demand for Brazil's raw materials reduced the demand for the&nbsp;Real from D to D<sub>1</sub>. At the same time failing to invest heavily in infrastructure as suggested in the text 'the&nbsp;waste of the boom years' the Brazilian government allowed a consumer boom that led to a rapid increase&nbsp;in imports of luxuries from the US. This caused an increase in supply of Real from S to S<sub>1</sub>, eventually&nbsp;leading to its depreciation.<br>Mexico, however, experienced a relatively small trade deficit and the value of Peso, therefore, is relatively&nbsp;more stable in fact it rises after 2012. The graph above shows the effect of this small trade deficit by a&nbsp;relatively smaller increase in supply of Peso. It, therefore, suggests that there was a little gap between&nbsp;demand and supply of Peso. This gap, however, was offset by increased demand for Peso resulting from&nbsp;long-term foreign investment in its companies and factories.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In Mexico spending on improving the education system and making its telecommunications, financial and energy&nbsp;sectors more efficient is likely to boost aggregate demand. After a while when this spending come into effect&nbsp;in terms of improved productivity of its factors of production, it is likely to increase aggregate supply. Thus&nbsp;the approach of Mexican government targeting a combination of an increase in aggregate demand along with&nbsp;improvement in supply sides is more likely to generate an expansion of the economy.<br>In Brazil, however, the government 'wasted the boom years' by failing to invest in education and infrastructure&nbsp;leading to supply bottlenecks. Also Brazilian approach of excess spending on imported luxury goods caused&nbsp;more outflow of money with little benefit in return. So, the Brazilian approach is unlikely to generate expansion&nbsp;as it resulted in a progressively smaller increase in AD along with no effective change in its output capacity.</li>
<li>An assessment of future prospects of the two economies requires a broader picture. We need additional&nbsp;information on factors such as their respective rate of inflation, the level of unemployment and demographic&nbsp;features.<br>A high rate of inflation, for instance, accompanying a large trade deficit might undermine growth prospects as&nbsp;the government priority in such a case would be to address these issues and therefore compromise on growth.&nbsp;A lower rate of inflation provides room for targeted growth strategies. Moreover, the relative inflation rates of&nbsp;these economies compared to their competitors in international trade would also be helpful in assessing whether&nbsp;the exports of the economies would remain competitive. Furthermore, we need data on their balance of payment&nbsp;in order to assess over all net flows of money.<br>Information on the levels of unemployment would help to assess the effectiveness of current economic policies&nbsp;as well as growth potential in future. A high rate of unemployment, for instance, suggests that the current&nbsp;economic policy is ineffective and with such measures same trend may prolong. Similarly the economy with&nbsp;the growing labour force might have better growth prospects because in future there will be more workers&nbsp;available to work with.<br>With reference to these two economies it is mentioned that their economic performance is linked with other&nbsp;economies. For example, it is clear that Mexico's prospects are linked to the United States so information on&nbsp;the US economy would be useful. Also, in the past, Brazil has been dependent upon demand for raw materials&nbsp;from China. The future prospects of Brazil therefore will depend upon economic activity in China. Signs of&nbsp;slow down in Chinese economy, for instance, can lead to a fall in demand for Brazilian raw material, it, therefore,&nbsp;can affect the growth prospects of Brazil. In conclusion it can be stated that the additional information, as&nbsp;explained above, will be useful in order to make a more accurate assessment of future economic prospects of&nbsp;these two economies.</li>

<li>lnflation is defined as a persistent and generalized&nbsp;increase in the level of prices. The term persistent implies&nbsp;that average of all prices is rising year in and year out.&nbsp;<br>Demand-pull inflation is largely the result of the level&nbsp;of aggregate demand (AD) being allowed to grow too&nbsp;fast compared to what the supply-side capacity can&nbsp;meet. The result is excess demand for goods and services&nbsp;and pressure on businesses to raise prices in order&nbsp;to increase their profit margins. These rises in aggregate&nbsp;demand may be due to rises in consumer demand, in the&nbsp;level of government expenditure, in investment by firms,&nbsp;or in foreign residents demand for the country's exports&nbsp;or any other combination of these four components&nbsp;of AD. The effect is illustrated in the figure below;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8fa5dcb246a99b366059812ab1b72f43" alt="" width="389" height="275"><br><br>The rise in aggregate demand is illustrated by a rightward&nbsp;shift in the aggregate demand curve, from AD<sub>1</sub> to&nbsp;AD<sub>2</sub>. Prices rise from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, and output rises from&nbsp;Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub>. The steeper the aggregate supply curve, the&nbsp;more prices will rise and the less output will increase.&nbsp;The aggregate supply curve will tend to become steeper&nbsp;as the economy approaches the peak of the business&nbsp;cycle. In other words, the closer actual output gets to&nbsp;potential output, and the less slack there is in the&nbsp;economy, the more will firms respond to a rise in demand&nbsp;by raising their prices.<br>On the contrary, cost-push inflation is associated with&nbsp;leftward (upward) shift in the aggregate supply curve.&nbsp;Such shifts occur when costs of production rise independent&nbsp;of aggregate demand. This rise in costs may&nbsp;originate due to the rise in wage rate or raw material&nbsp;prices. An increase in tax rate or depreciation of a&nbsp;country's currency may also result in higher costs. So&nbsp;if firms face a rise in costs, they will respond partly by&nbsp;raising prices and passing the costs to the 'consumer&nbsp;and partly by cutting back on production. This is shown&nbsp;by the graph below;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7d44b50b65096bfd390bab809aba4418" alt="" width="362" height="265"><br><br>There is a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve:&nbsp;from AS<sub>1</sub> to AS<sub>2</sub>. This causes the price level to rise to&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub> and the level of output to fall to Q<sub>2</sub>. Just how much&nbsp;firms raise prices and cut back on production depends&nbsp;on the shape of the aggregate demand curve.<br>Demand-pull inflation is typically associated with a&nbsp;booming economy. Many economists therefore argue that&nbsp;it is the counterpart of demand-deficient unemployment.&nbsp;"When the economy is in recession, demand-deficient&nbsp;unemployment will be high, but demand-pull inflation&nbsp;will be low. When, on the other hand, the economy is&nbsp;near the peak of the business cycle, demand-pull inflation&nbsp;will be high, but demand-deficient unemployment&nbsp;will be low.<br>However, the effect of cost push inflation on output&nbsp;and employment will be the opposite of demand-pull&nbsp;inflation. With demand pull inflation, output and hence&nbsp;employment will tend to rise. With cost push inflation&nbsp;employment and output fall.</li>
<li>Inflation is defined as a persistent and generalized increase&nbsp;in the level of prices. The term persistent implies&nbsp;that average of all prices is rising year in and year out.&nbsp;Inflation affects domestic economy as much as it does&nbsp;to the country's trade position.<br>Persisting inflation, particularly disturbs the distribution&nbsp;of income and wealth and therefore profoundly affect&nbsp;the existing social order. In times of rising price level&nbsp;people on fixed incomes and those in a weak bargaining&nbsp;position become poorer whereas those who can use their&nbsp;economic power to gain large pay rent or profit gain.&nbsp;There is also a redistribution of income from lenders to&nbsp;borrowers that discourages savings. If the Chancellor&nbsp;fails to increase personal income tax allowances (the&nbsp;amount which a worker can earn tax free) in line with&nbsp;inflation, then the burden of tax will increase, transferring&nbsp;resources from the tax payers to the government.&nbsp;Moreover, it tends to cause uncertainty among the&nbsp;business community. If it is difficult for firms to predict&nbsp;their costs and revenues, they may be discouraged from&nbsp;investing. This will reduce the rate of economic growth.&nbsp;On the other hand, policies to reduce the rate of inflation&nbsp;may themselves reduce the rate of economic growth,&nbsp;especially in the short run. This may then provide the&nbsp;government with a policy dilemma.<br>Inflation also requires firms to use extra resources to&nbsp;cope with its effects. Accountants and other financial&nbsp;experts, for instance, may have to be employed by&nbsp;companies to help them cope with the uncertainties or&nbsp;extra costs have to be incurred to change price labels,&nbsp;or prices in catalogues or menus, or adjust slot machines.&nbsp;The costs of inflation may be relatively mild if inflation&nbsp;is kept to single figures. They can be very serious,&nbsp;however If inflation develops into hyperinflation with&nbsp;prices rising perhaps by several hundred per cent or&nbsp;even thousands per cent per year, the whole basis of&nbsp;free market economy will be undermined. Firms constantly&nbsp;raise prices in an attempt to cover their rocketing&nbsp;costs. Workers demand huge pay increases in an&nbsp;attempt to stay ahead of the rocketing cost of living.&nbsp;Thus prices and wages chase each other in an ever-rising&nbsp;inflationary spiral. People will no longer want to save&nbsp;money. Instead they will spend it as quickly as possible&nbsp;before its value falls. People may even resort to barter&nbsp;in an attempt to avoid using money altogether.<br>Price increases are deeply unpopular. People feel that&nbsp;they are worse off, even if their incomes rise by more&nbsp;than the rate of inflation. Thus inflation can have far&nbsp;reaching effects on domestic output business profits and&nbsp;employment.<br>Uncertainty caused by inflation also affects the country's&nbsp;foreign trade. If, for instance, a country suffers from&nbsp;relatively high inflation, its exports will become less&nbsp;competitive in the world market. At the same time,&nbsp;imports will become relatively cheaper than home-produced&nbsp;goods. Thus exports will fall and imports will&nbsp;rise. In the short term, the effect on export and import&nbsp;demand tends to be low because of low price elasticity&nbsp;of demand. Therefore, an improvement in its term of&nbsp;trade caused by rising export prices could improve&nbsp;country's export earnings and hence trade balance.<br>In the long run, however, a relatively higher rate of&nbsp;inflation makes a country's exports less price competitive&nbsp;in the world markets. Also, industries which produce&nbsp;import substitutes find it more difficult to compete&nbsp;in the domestic economy because imports become&nbsp;relatively cheaper. Consequently this may show through&nbsp;in reduced export orders, lower profits and fewer jobs&nbsp;leading to a worsening of a country's trade balance and&nbsp;eventually causing its exchange rate to fall.<br>In most cases domestic effects of inflation are more wide&nbsp;spread, therefore, government should be more concerned&nbsp;with the domestic effects. However, if a country is highly&nbsp;dependent on foreign trade then domestic stability is&nbsp;directly linked with the country's trade performance,&nbsp;therefore, it should be more concerned with the external&nbsp;effects of inflation.</li>

<li>Income elasticity of demand (YED) is a numerical measure&nbsp;of the sensitivity of quantity demanded of a product to&nbsp;change in money income of the buyers. So, YED coefficient&nbsp;tells us what the percentage change in the quantity&nbsp;demanded for a good is following a given change in&nbsp;the income of the consumer. Cross elasticity of demand&nbsp;(XED), on the other hand, is a numerical measure of the&nbsp;sensitivity of quantity demanded of one product following&nbsp;a change in the price of another. XED coefficient,&nbsp;therefore, tells us what the proportionate change in the&nbsp;quantity demanded for one good is following a given&nbsp;change in the price of a related good.<br>Economists use the following to measure coefficient of&nbsp;XED.<br><br>XED =(Percentage change in the quantity demanded of product A)/(Percentage change in the price of product B)<br><br>These percentage changes are calculated by dividing the&nbsp;change in price of good A by the original price of A and&nbsp;the change in quantity demanded of good B by the original&nbsp;quantity demanded of B.<br><br>The following measure is used to calculate the coefficient&nbsp;of YED.<br><br>YED =(Percentage change in the quantity demanded)/(Percentage change in the income)<br><br>These % changes are calculated by dividing the change&nbsp;in income by the original income and the change in quantity&nbsp;demanded by the original quantity demanded.<br>Note that the formula of YED is identical to that for&nbsp;XED except that we are dividing the proportionate&nbsp;change in quantity demanded by the change in income&nbsp;rather than by change in price of a related good.<br><br>With income elasticity of demand the sign attached the&nbsp;ratio is all important. A plus sign (+) signifies a so-called&nbsp;normal good whereas a minus sign (-) reveals the product&nbsp;to be an 'inferior' good. For most goods the coefficient&nbsp;of YED is positive i.e. demand for a normal good&nbsp;always rises with income. Normal goods are further&nbsp;classified into:<br><strong><br></strong>Superior goods (luxury goods) for which income elasticity&nbsp;of demand is greater than unity, and basic goods&nbsp;for which income elasticity of demand is&nbsp;less than 1.<br>Although the quantity demanded of a normal good always&nbsp;rises with income, it rises more than proportionately&nbsp;for a superior good, for example, luxury cars.&nbsp;Conversely, demand for a basic good such as detergent&nbsp;rises at a slower rate than income. Negative coefficient&nbsp;of income elasticity of demand indicates an inferior good.&nbsp;Consumers decrease the purchase of these goods, such&nbsp;as used clothes, as their incomes increase.<br><br>The coefficient of XED is positive if the two products&nbsp;are substitutes. It is when the quantity demanded of&nbsp;product A moves in the same direction as price of B. For example, an increase in price of mutton results in&nbsp;an increase in demand for beef. The larger the positive&nbsp;XED coefficient, the greater is the substitutability&nbsp;between the two products.<br><br>When XED coefficient is negative the two products are&nbsp;complementary (consumed together). An increase in the&nbsp;price of one decreases the demand for the other. The&nbsp;larger the negative XED coefficient the greater is the&nbsp;complementarity between the two goods. If, however,&nbsp;XED = 0 then the two products are unrelated or independent&nbsp;goods.<br><br></li>
<li>In a market economy prices of goods and services are&nbsp;determined by the market forces of demand and supply.&nbsp;Firms sell their output at market prices and receipts&nbsp;from their sales are called revenues. It is measured by&nbsp;multiplying per unit price (p) with the quantity sold&nbsp;( q). Thus TR = P x Q as shown in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/911759de04e50de4db177a8a9e480f7a" alt="" width="204" height="163"><br><br>The Shaded area in the graph indicates revenue&nbsp;(Op x Oq = Opeq) earned by the firm from selling Oq&nbsp;output at Op per unit price. In order to analyze how&nbsp;a change in demand affects the revenues earned by the&nbsp;firm consider the following graphs.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f88a31c9a4e18adab493d077074ec343" alt="" width="401" height="201"><br><br>A rightward shift in demand curve from D to D<sub>1</sub> suggests&nbsp;an increase in demand and hence an increase in per&nbsp;unit price and quantity sold. As a result firm's revenues&nbsp;rise as indicated by the shaded area i.e. the area that&nbsp;measures revenues after demand rises i.e. the area OP<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1</sub> q<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>measuring revenues after demand rises is larger than the&nbsp;area OPeq. On the contrary a leftward shift in demand&nbsp;curve from D to D<sub>1</sub> suggests a decrease in demand and&nbsp;hence a decrease in per unit price and quantity sold. As&nbsp;a result firm's revenues fall as shown by the shaded area&nbsp;i.e. the area OP<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1</sub>q<sub>1</sub> measuring revenues before demand&nbsp;falls is larger than the area OPeq.<br><br>Firms often use income elasticity of demand (YED) and&nbsp;cross elasticity of demand (XED) in order to forecast&nbsp;changes in demand and hence revenues earned from selling&nbsp;their products. In case of YED the direction of change&nbsp;in revenues (TR) depends on the direction of change in&nbsp;demand and the type of commodity. Since normal goods&nbsp;have positive YED therefore, irrespective of income elastic&nbsp;or inelastic demand, an increase in demand always results&nbsp;in an increase in TR and a decrease in demand&nbsp;causes TR to fall. However the extent of change in demand&nbsp;and hence revenues depends on the degree of YED. So,&nbsp;the higher the YED, the larger the change in revenues is&nbsp;predicted.<br><br>Considering the graphs above, let's assume that the firm,&nbsp;using its past data, has confirmed that the good it sells&nbsp;is considered normal in general. Now if the firm forecasts&nbsp;an increase in demand possibly due to the rising&nbsp;trend of money incomes of buyers then it will predict&nbsp;an increase in its revenues as shown in the graph on the&nbsp;left. If, however, it forecasts a decreasing trend in money&nbsp;incomes possibly due to the economy going into recession&nbsp;then it will predict a fall in demand and hence&nbsp;revenues as shown by the shaded area in the graph on&nbsp;the right.<br><br>Let's assume that the past data suggests the firm is&nbsp;selling an inferior good then a fall in money incomes will&nbsp;increase demand and therefore firm will predict an increase&nbsp;in its revenues. On the contrary if firm's forecast&nbsp;suggests that money incomes are rising then firm's sales&nbsp;and hence revenues are likely to decrease. The extent of&nbsp;change in revenues will be determined by the proportionate&nbsp;change in money incomes and the proportionate&nbsp;change in QD.<br><br>In case of cross elasticity of demand the firm can predict&nbsp;changes in its revenues by considering the likely&nbsp;changes in prices of substitute and complementary goods&nbsp;and their effects on demand for its own product.<br><br>Let's assume that the firm's forecast suggests a rise in&nbsp;the price of a close substitute good making it relatively&nbsp;expensive then the good sold by the firm, it can then&nbsp;predict an increase in the demand for its product and&nbsp;hence an increase in revenues. Similarly a forecast of a&nbsp;fall in price of a close substitute relative to the price of&nbsp;the firm's product will decrease the demand and hence&nbsp;a decrease in revenues earned by the firm.<br><br>If, however, the firm expects the price of a complementary&nbsp;good to rise then it will predict a fall in demand&nbsp;for its product and hence a fall in revenues earned from&nbsp;its sales. On the contrary if price of a complementary&nbsp;good is expected to fall then the firm can predict a rise&nbsp;in demand for its product and hence an increase in its&nbsp;revenues earned. In both cases the extent of change in&nbsp;demand and hence revenues depends on the degree of&nbsp;cross elasticity of demand.<br><br>Both YED and XED are useful measures to predict&nbsp;changes in revenues in different situations. When a firm&nbsp;can predict the actions and reactions of rival firms more&nbsp;accurately it may find XED a more useful measure. But&nbsp;uncertain behavior of competitive firms or the market in&nbsp;general may make XED less relevant. Similarly an accurate&nbsp;forecast of changes in incomes and the degree of&nbsp;YED may prove to be more useful provided other&nbsp;demand factors do not change. But in a more dynamic&nbsp;environment in the market where a score of other factors&nbsp;influence demand simultaneously may undermine&nbsp;the relevance of YED. So we conclude that both XED&nbsp;and YED could be useful for a firm depending upon the&nbsp;circumstances.</li>

The price is not allowed to rise above this level&nbsp;but it is permitted to fall below it. Government uses&nbsp;price ceiling in circumstances when equilibrium price set&nbsp;by the market forces for some essential food items is&nbsp;unfairly high and it may not be affordable for less&nbsp;privileged. If the ceiling is set above the equilibrium price,&nbsp;it has no effect, since the equilibrium remains attainable.&nbsp;If, however, the maximum price is set below the free&nbsp;market equilibrium price, the price ceiling lowers the&nbsp;price and is said to be binding or effective. The effects&nbsp;on the markets are illustrated by the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f5c17b6dc8e558b8ffc82859aeb0b910" alt="" width="317" height="206"></p>
<p>The free market equilibrium price of an essential food&nbsp;item is at 'p' and quantity traded is oq. If, however,&nbsp;government fixes a maximum at p<sub>1</sub> at this lower price,&nbsp;firms, par-ticularly those with higher costs, will supply&nbsp;less, and supply will be Q<sub>2</sub>. Consumers, on the other&nbsp;hand, will demand more at this low price; they would&nbsp;like to purchase the quantity Q<sub>2</sub>. So demand exceeds&nbsp;supply, and a shortage q<sub>2</sub> - q<sub>1</sub> develops.</p>
<p>As a consequence of maximum price some people gain&nbsp;and some lose. As the graph above clearly suggests, firms&nbsp;lose - they receive lower price, and some might leave&nbsp;the industry. Consumers who can purchase this item at&nbsp;a lower price are clearly better off, but those who have&nbsp;been rationed out and cannot buy due to the shortage&nbsp;are worse off. The gain to consumers is the difference&nbsp;between rectangle D and triangle B. The loss to producers&nbsp;is the sum of rectangle D and triangle C. Triangles&nbsp;B and C together measure the deadweight welfare loss&nbsp;from price controls.</p>
<p>Since maximum price undermines the rationing ability of&nbsp;the free market, hence, at the ceiling price there is a&nbsp;lasting shortage of the good. In this situation when&nbsp;quantity supplied is insufficient to satisfy everyone who&nbsp;wishes to buy the good, some other method of allocation&nbsp;must be adopted. Sellers, for instance, sell their&nbsp;available supplies on a "first come, first served" basis.&nbsp;Long queues of buyers at shops will develop, and&nbsp;allocation will be on the basis of luck. Alternatively sellers&nbsp;may keep products under the counter and sell only&nbsp;on the basis of favoritism.</p>
<p>Consequently, the government is required to adopt a&nbsp;system of rationing because an unregulated shortage leads&nbsp;to an inequitable (unfair) distribution of the product.</p>
<p>Rationing is when the government limits the amount of&nbsp;a good that people are allowed to purchase. The authorities&nbsp;can ration the goods by giving out ration coupons&nbsp;sufficient to buy the available supply. In this case&nbsp;coupons might be distributed equally or on some criteria&nbsp;such as level of income etc. If government can regulate&nbsp;an effective rationing system, then poor people, who&nbsp;could not have afforded these items at market clearing&nbsp;prices, now will be able to buy at maximum prices.&nbsp;Thus it will help poorer.</p>
<p>However a major consequence of maximum price on food&nbsp;items, with or without rationing, is the emergence of&nbsp;black markets. This is a market in which the items will&nbsp;be sold illegally at whatever price equates illegal demand&nbsp;and supply. The existence of such a market depends on&nbsp;there being a few people willing to risk heavy penalties&nbsp;by running a black market and a large number of consumers&nbsp;prepared to purchase the product on such a&nbsp;market. For instance, black marketers would buy q<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;amount of the good at the controlled price p<sub>1</sub> paying the&nbsp;amount shown by rectangle E. They would sell at the&nbsp;price p<sub>2</sub>, earning profits shown by the sum of rectangles&nbsp;A and D.</p>
<p>Besides rationing, government can adopt other measures&nbsp;to alter either demand or supply to minimize the shortage.&nbsp;Government may attempt, for instance, to encourage&nbsp;supply by drawing on stocks if available or else it&nbsp;can increase production by direct involvement. Situation&nbsp;can also improve if government gives subsidies or tax&nbsp;relief to producers. All these measures would help to&nbsp;increase market supply and therefore reduce the level of&nbsp;shortage. However, these are costly measures and the&nbsp;burden might fall on tax payers.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that effective maximum price&nbsp;on its own may not help all the poorer unless government&nbsp;takes effective measures to deal with the problems&nbsp;followed by shortage.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 219</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8747</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the meaning of the term 'equilibrium price and quantity' in the market for a good or service and show how a new equilibrium is established when there is an increase in demand.&nbsp; [8]</p>

It exists when&nbsp;opposing forces are in balance. In a market, equilibrium&nbsp;is a situation when the plans of both buyers and sellers&nbsp;exactly match i.e. QD = QS. As a result there is no&nbsp;tendency for market price or quantity traded to change&nbsp;any further. Let us begin our analysis with the basic&nbsp;supply-demand diagram as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/07fcbe1b4ceb093a359fe86f64667c59" alt="" width="269" height="233"></p>
<p>The supply curve S tells us how much producers are&nbsp;willing to sell for each price. The curve slopes upward&nbsp;because the higher the price, the more firms are usually&nbsp;able and willing to produce and sell. The demand curve&nbsp;D tells us how much consumers are willing to buy for&nbsp;each price. It slopes downward because consumers are&nbsp;usually ready to buy more if the price is lower.</p>
<p>The two curves intersect at point 'e' the equilibrium&nbsp;point from where we identify equilibrium price 'P<sub>e</sub>' on&nbsp;vertical axis and equilibrium quantity 'Q <sub>e</sub>' on horizontal&nbsp;axis. At this point there is neither shortage nor excess&nbsp;supply, so there is no pressure either on the price or&nbsp;the quantity to change any further.<br>To understand why markets tend to clear, suppose the&nbsp;price was initially above the market clearing level, say&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub>, then producers would try to produce and sell more&nbsp;than consumers were willing to buy. A surplus would&nbsp;accumulate, and to sell this surplus or at least prevent&nbsp;it from growing producers would begin to lower their&nbsp;prices. Eventually price would fall, quantity demanded&nbsp;would increase, and quantity supplied would decrease&nbsp;until the equilibrium price P<sub>e</sub> was reached.</p>
<p>The opposite would happen if the price was initially&nbsp;below 'P<sub>e</sub>' say, at P<sub>2</sub>. A shortage would develop because&nbsp;consumers would be unable to purchase all they would&nbsp;like at this price. This would-put upward pressure on&nbsp;price as consumers tried to outbid one another for existing supplies and producers reacted by increasing&nbsp;price and expanding output. Again, the price would&nbsp;eventually reach P<sub>e</sub>·</p>
<p>This equilibrium price will remain unchanged only so&nbsp;long as the demand and supply curves remain unchanged.&nbsp;If either of the curves shifts, a new equilibrium will be&nbsp;formed. Now let's assume that demand increases, say&nbsp;either due to a rise in money income or a rise in price&nbsp;of a substitute good or a change in any other factor that&nbsp;affects demand then a new equilibrium price and quantity&nbsp;will be determined. Consider the graph below:</p>

<p>A rightward shift in demand curve D to D<sub>1</sub> suggests an&nbsp;increase in demand. Initially there would be ashortage&nbsp;of a - b at the original price P<sub>e</sub>· This would cause price&nbsp;to rise to the new equilibrium P<sub>1</sub>.

<p style="text-align: left;">New Zealand’s terms of trade declined 3.2% from June to September 2012. There was a 13%&nbsp;drop in dairy prices which contributed to a 32% rise in the volumes of dairy products exported;&nbsp;the net effect on the total value of dairy exports was an increase of 16%. Meat prices fell 6%, but&nbsp;volumes were 15% higher, so that export receipts from the sector were 8.9% higher than June.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Exports of transport equipment fell 7.2% in volume terms, which was likely to reflect reduced&nbsp;economic activity in Australia and the United States, the key markets for New Zealand’s&nbsp;manufactured exports. Demand in Australia is expected to recover in 2013, aided by interest rate&nbsp;cuts and renewed economic activity in China. Furthermore, prices for many of New Zealand’s&nbsp;key export commodities were showing signs of improvement, and as international inflationary&nbsp;pressures remained weak, the terms of trade were expected to stabilise during 2013.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">New Zealand's annual balance of trade deficit has increased to NZ$1.4 billion in October 2012, up from a&nbsp;deficit of NZ$875 million in the previous year. The total value of exports in October 2012 was 11% lower&nbsp;than in October the previous year. This can partially be explained by a 5.5% rise in the exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar over that period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dairy products accounted for nearly half the decline in exports, down 20% on October 2011. Imports at&nbsp;NZ$4.2 billion were up 1. 7% on October 2011, due to higher imports of machinery and of consumer goods.</p>

<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>The terms of trade is the ratio of export prices to import prices. New Zealand's terms of trade index was&nbsp;recorded at 130 in June 2011 and then it fell to less than 120 in Sep.2012. This decline in the index value&nbsp;of terms of trade suggests that it has deteriorated.</li>
<li>Fig. 1 suggests that there is a drop in the export price index from a little over than 120 to 105 while import&nbsp;price index remained steady at around 90. Thus the prices of exports relative to the prices of imports have&nbsp;declined and therefore account for the deterioration in TOT.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Price elasticity of demand is a numerical measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded following a&nbsp;change in the price of the same good. PED for New Zealand meat can be calculated as;<br>PED = (%Δin QD of meat)/(%Δin price of meat)&nbsp;⇒ -2.5 = (15%)/(-6%)</li>
<li>Demand for meat is price elastic (PED&gt; 1), therefore, a proportionately larger increase in demand for meat&nbsp;had a bigger effect on receipts from its exports than the proportionate fall in the price of meat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Information in the data suggests that key export commodity prices were showing signs of improvement. This&nbsp;could be attributed to a fall in interest rate in Australia and a renewed economic activity in China leading to&nbsp;a higher demand for New Zealand's exports. On the other hand weak international inflationary pressure was&nbsp;likely to maintain the prices of New Zealand's import. Thus a reversing trend in export prices and stable import&nbsp;prices were expected to stabilize New Zealand' terms of trade.</li>
<li>The theory of comparative advantage suggests that a country must concentrate on production of those goods&nbsp;in which it has the greatest comparative cost advantage. Comparative cost advantage refers to the opportunity&nbsp;costs of producing those goods arising from the differences in factor endowments, culture and traditions and&nbsp;technology. New Zealand specializes in exports of dairy products and meat because it can produce these goods&nbsp;at a lower opportunity costs than its trading partners. Similarly import of machinery and various consumer items&nbsp;suggests that other countries can produce them at lower opportunity cost than New Zealand.</li>
<li>The data reflects that New Zealand's terms of trade had declined after June 2011. This meant that the price&nbsp;of New Zealand's exports relative to the price of its imports had fallen. This would provide a competitive&nbsp;advantage to New Zealand's products that would be expected to reduce the balance of trade deficit or turn the&nbsp;deficit into a surplus. However, in Oct. 2012 the annual balance of trade deficit has increased to $NZ 1.4 billion&nbsp;compared to a deficit of $NZ875 recorded in 2011. This could be attributed to the elasticity of demand for&nbsp;exports and imports. According to the Marshall Lerner condition a fall in export price would improve balance&nbsp;of trade if PED of its exports is greater than one. This is because a fall in price of exports brings about a&nbsp;proportionately greater rise in demand for its exports and hence the total receipts from exports also rise. But&nbsp;if the foreign demand for exports is inelastic then the total receipts fall and the deficit increases.<br>Furthermore, decreasing prices of New Zealand's exports could be supported by J-curve. The J-curve theory&nbsp;predicts that a fall in export price will initially worsen and then improve a country's trade deficit. This is shown&nbsp;in figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a358cf9b5eed920ef80cc429a48a9bb7" alt="" width="312" height="222"><br><br>According to the J-curve theory a fall in export price relative to import price worsens trade deficit because the&nbsp;price effect will dominate the volume of exports in the short run. In other words the lower price of exports&nbsp;will more than offset the increased volumes of exports so that the deficit worsens. Over the longer period,&nbsp;however, improvement will set in to bring about greater export revenue due to the elastic demend for exports.&nbsp;Thus deterioration in New Zealand's terms of trade affected its trade balance negatively due to the inelastic&nbsp;demand for its exports in the short run. In the long run, however, it is expected to improve its trade balance.</li>

The term persistent implies&nbsp;that average of all prices is rising year in and year out.&nbsp;Inflation affects domestic economy as much as it does&nbsp;to the country's trade position.</p>
<p>Persisting inflation, particularly disturbs the distribution&nbsp;of income and wealth and therefore profoundly affect&nbsp;the existing social order. In times of rising price level,&nbsp;for instance, people on fixed incomes and those in a&nbsp;weak bargaining position become poorer whereas those&nbsp;who can use their economic power to gain large pay rent&nbsp;or profit gain. There is also a redistribution of income&nbsp;from lenders to borrowers that discourages savings. If&nbsp;the Chancellor fails to increase personal income tax&nbsp;allowances (the amount which a worker can earn tax&nbsp;free) in line with inflation, then the burden of tax will&nbsp;increase, transferring resources from the tax payers to&nbsp;the government.</p>
<p>Moreover, it tends to cause uncertainty among the&nbsp;business community. If it is difficult for firms to predict&nbsp;their costs and revenues, they may be discouraged from&nbsp;investing. This will reduce the rate of economic growth.&nbsp;On the other hand, policies to reduce the rate of inflation&nbsp;may themselves reduce the rate of economic growth,&nbsp;especially in the short run. This may then provide the&nbsp;government with a policy dilemma.</p>
<p>Inflation also requires firms to use extra resources to&nbsp;cope with its effects. Accountants and other financial&nbsp;experts, for instance, may have to be employed by&nbsp;companies to help them cope with the uncertainties or&nbsp;extra costs have to be incurred to change price labels,&nbsp;or prices in catalogues or menus, or adjust slot machines.&nbsp;The costs of inflation maybe relatively mild if inflation&nbsp;is kept to single figures. They can be very serious,&nbsp;however if inflation develops into hyperinflation with&nbsp;prices rising perhaps by several hundred per cent or&nbsp;even thousands per cent per year, the whole basis of&nbsp;free market economy will be undermined. Firms constantly&nbsp;raise prices in an attempt to cover their rockages&nbsp;eting costs. Workers demand huge pay increases in an&nbsp;attempt to stay ahead of the rocketing cost of living.&nbsp;Thus prices and wages chase each other in an ever-rising&nbsp;inflationary spiral. People will no longer want to save&nbsp;money. Instead they will spend it as quickly as possible&nbsp;before its value falls. People may even resort to barter&nbsp;in an attempt to avoid using money altogether.</p>
<p>Price increases are deeply unpopular. People feel that&nbsp;they are worse off, even if their incomes rise by more&nbsp;than the rate of inflation. Thus inflation can have powerful&nbsp;effects on the domestic economy affecting variables&nbsp;such as the real output, business profits and jobs.</p>
<p>Uncertainty caused by inflation also affects the country's&nbsp;foreign trade. If, for instance, a country suffers from&nbsp;relatively high inflation, its exports will become less&nbsp;competitive in the world market. At the same time,&nbsp;imports will become relatively cheaper than home-produced&nbsp;goods. Thus exports will fall and imports will&nbsp;rise. In the short term, the effect on export and import&nbsp;demand tends to be low because of low price elasticity&nbsp;of demand. Therefore, an improvement in its term of&nbsp;trade caused by rising export prices could improve&nbsp;country's export earnings and hence trade balance.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, if a country has a much higher&nbsp;rate of inflation than others for a considerable period of&nbsp;time, this will make its exports less price competitive&nbsp;in world markets. Also, industries which produce import&nbsp;substitutes find it more difficult to compete in the&nbsp;domestic economy because imports become relatively&nbsp;cheaper. Eventually this may show through reduced&nbsp;export orders, lower profits and fewer jobs, and also in&nbsp;a worsening of a country's trade balance and depreciation&nbsp;in the value of its currency.</p>
<p>In most cases domestic effects of inflation are more wide&nbsp;spread, therefore, government should be more concerned&nbsp;with the domestic effects. However, if a country is highly&nbsp;dependent on foreign trade then domestic stability is&nbsp;directly linked with the country's trade performance,&nbsp;therefore, it should be more concerned with the external&nbsp;effects of inflation.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 222</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8743</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Define the components of aggregate demand and, with&nbsp;the help of a diagram, explain how an increase in spending&nbsp;in an economy might result in inflation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Aggregate demand (AD) shows various amounts of&nbsp;goods and services (real output) that domestic consumers,&nbsp;businesses, government, and foreign buyers collectively&nbsp;desire to purchase at each possible price level.&nbsp;Thus AD = C + I + G + X - M.</p>
<p>Consumption (C) expenditure includes expenditure on&nbsp;all goods and services produced and sold to their final&nbsp;users. It includes services, such as medical care and&nbsp;goods, such as fresh meat, vegetables cars, television&nbsp;sets etc. Investment (I) is defined as expenditure on the&nbsp;production of goods not for present consumption, but&nbsp;rather for their use in the future. The goods that are&nbsp;created by this expenditure are called investment (or&nbsp;capital) goods. Investment expenditure can be divided&nbsp;into three categories: stock-building, fixed capital formation&nbsp;and the construction of residential housing. When&nbsp;governments (G) provide goods and services that households&nbsp;want, such as health care and street lighting, it is&nbsp;obvious that they are adding to the sum total of valuable&nbsp;output in the same way as do private firms. Net exports&nbsp;(X - M) represents total exports of goods and services&nbsp;minus total imports of goods and services.</p>
<p>Other things equal, the lower the price level, the larger&nbsp;the real output the buyers will purchase. Conversely,&nbsp;the higher the price level, the smaller the real output&nbsp;they will buy. Thus the relationship between the price&nbsp;level and the amount of real output demanded is inverse.&nbsp;However, if one or more of those "other things" change,&nbsp;the entire AD curve shifts. We refer to those "other&nbsp;things" as determinants of AD i.e. C, I, G, X - M.</p>
<p>Thus an increase in AD is the result of higher consumer&nbsp;spending (C), increased capital spending (I), a rise in&nbsp;government expenditure on goods and services (G) and&nbsp;an increase in net exports (X - M). So when AD rises&nbsp;firms will respond to a rise in demand partly by raising&nbsp;prices and partly by increasing output. Just how much&nbsp;they raise prices depends on how much their costs rise&nbsp;as a result of increasing output. In other words, it will&nbsp;depend on the slope of the AS curve. Consider the&nbsp;following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/038c28313e5a1d8001a1736cd25a14a2" alt="" width="400" height="246"></p>
<p>An aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the level of real&nbsp;domestic output which will be produced at each price&nbsp;level. Upward sloping AS suggests that higher price levels&nbsp;create an incentive for enterprises to produce and sell&nbsp;more, while lower price levels reduce output. As a result,&nbsp;the relationship between the price level and the amount&nbsp;of real output businesses offer for sale is direct or&nbsp;positive. Equilibrium output is determined by the intersection&nbsp;of AD ＆ AS.</p>
<p>At output Y<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;the economy is in a severe recession and&nbsp;that large amount of unused machinery and equipment&nbsp;and unemployed workers are available for production.&nbsp;These idle resources (both human and property) can be&nbsp;put back at work with little or no upward pressure on&nbsp;the prices. Thus an increase in AD results in an increase&nbsp;in real GDP from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub> accompanied with some&nbsp;increase in general price level. As the AD rises further&nbsp;to AD<sub>3</sub> economy expands in real output from Y<sub>2</sub> to Y<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;some industries may encounter shortages of workers&nbsp;while other industries face substantial unemployment.&nbsp;At the same time in certain industries raw material shortages&nbsp;or other production bottlenecks may begin to appear.&nbsp;Expansion may also mean some firms will be forced to&nbsp;use older and less efficient machinery as they approach&nbsp;capacity production. Also, less capable workers may be&nbsp;hired as output expands. All these things tend to&nbsp;decrease productivity, increase costs, and raise prices&nbsp;from P<sub>2</sub> to P<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>On the extreme, we find that the economy reaches its&nbsp;full capacity real output Y<sub>f</sub>· Any increase in the AD and&nbsp;hence the price level in this range will not produce&nbsp;additional real output because the economy is already&nbsp;operating at its full capacity. Resources and additional&nbsp;production, which one firm gains will be lost by some&nbsp;other firm. This bidding will raise resource prices (costs)&nbsp;and ultimately product prices, but real output will remain&nbsp;unchanged.<br>Thus it follows that persistent increase in spending can&nbsp;lead to acceleration in inflation as the economy uses up&nbsp;scarce resources and short run aggregate supply becomes&nbsp;inelastic.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 223</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8741</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In a free market price rations scarce goods.<br>Explain this statement and, with the help of a diagram,&nbsp;show how price rations scarce goods when there is an&nbsp;increase in the costs of production.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>In a free market, price mechanism is the organizing force.&nbsp;Price mechanism is a term used to describe the means&nbsp;by which the many millions of decisions taken each day&nbsp;by consumers and businesses interact to determine the&nbsp;allocation of scarce resources among competing uses.&nbsp;Invisible hand, so the price mechanism is known operates&nbsp;in a competitive market through the pursuit of&nbsp;self-interest to allocate scarce resources in society's best&nbsp;interest. Thus it remains the essence of the ideology of&nbsp;free market system.</p>
<p>For markets to operate in an orderly and efficient manner&nbsp;the buyers and sellers in the market must respond to the&nbsp;incentives provided by the price mechanism, thus price&nbsp;system functions as a signal and an incentive for producers&nbsp;to act in the required way to maximise their gain,&nbsp;which, in turn, optimises the allocation of resources.&nbsp;However, a distinguishing function of market price is to&nbsp;ration scarce goods when demand in a market outstrips&nbsp;supply. Consider the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/78a91b7364a8530dd3bef97a08cb7a2f" alt="" width="375" height="268"></p>
<p>Suppose that in a particular market costs of production&nbsp;increases say due to a rise in wages or increase in price&nbsp;of any other inputs. The higher costs of production&nbsp;would limit profits at each and every price. Hence the&nbsp;firms will cut back on production from q to q<sub>1</sub>, probably&nbsp;switching some of the resources to other more&nbsp;profitable products. This will, therefore, shift the supply&nbsp;curve to the left from S to S<sub>1</sub>. So there will be a&nbsp;shortage of a - b at the old price OP. This would&nbsp;increase the market price to P<sub>1</sub> leading to a movement&nbsp;along the demand curve from point b to e and along the&nbsp;new supply curve from point a to point e.</p>
<p>Thus an immediate result is that the rising price serves&nbsp;to limit to some extent the higher demand for the good&nbsp;which has now become more expensive compared to&nbsp;other goods, thereby creating an incentive for consumers&nbsp;to economise in its use. But simultaneously, the possibility&nbsp;of higher profits creates an incentive for firms to&nbsp;shift resources into producing the goods, whose relative&nbsp;price has risen and to demand more resources such as&nbsp;labour and capital in order to increase their output.</p>
<p>Thus when a fall in supply causes a shortage, the price&nbsp;is bid up - leaving only those with the willingness and&nbsp;ability to pay. Hence the rationing function of price&nbsp;serves to ration scarce goods in favour of consumers&nbsp;with the willingness and ability to pay a higher price for&nbsp;a good.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 224</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8740</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Palm Oil Production</strong></p>

So, changes in natural conditions or availability of skilled labour might result in&nbsp;changes in productivity of land. Hence information on changes in all other inputs would give better understanding&nbsp;of changes in productivity of palm oil industry in Indonesia.</li>
<li>Firstly governments can introduce green tax. A green tax is levied on a good or service, which is judged to be&nbsp;detrimental to the environment. In this case governments may introduce a tax on a factor input such as land&nbsp;used to produce palm oil. The main aim of such taxation is to increase the private cost so that the producers&nbsp;or consumers pay for environmental damages that their actions create. Since there is a direct link between the&nbsp;level of output / consumption and the total environmental damages, therefore, the tax is likely to contract&nbsp;demand and reduce the level of output to the estimated social optimum level of production.<br>A well designed environmental tax can encourage innovation and the development of new cleaner technologies.&nbsp;Also, revenue derived from these taxes can be earmarked for lower taxes elsewhere in the economy&nbsp;or can be used to fund increased spending on environmental projects. However, there are problems in setting&nbsp;tax that equates marginal private costs with the marginal social costs. This is because no government can&nbsp;accurately predict how consumers and/or producers will respond to higher costs and prices. Furthermore,&nbsp;such a tax reduces output and raises price, and this might have an adverse effect on consumer welfare.&nbsp;Secondly, it might be more cost-effective for governments to switch away from environmental tax to direct&nbsp;subsidy that encourages greater innovation in designing cleaner production technologies. Thus a subsidy can&nbsp;be provided to research centers encouraging them to develop cleaner techniques to increase per yield&nbsp;so that increase in output of palm oil can, at least, reduce the pressure of clearing forests for cultivation.&nbsp;However, the potential benefits from research are uncertain and technological breakthroughs might take a&nbsp;long period of time. Also, the burden of subsidy eventually falls on tax payers.<br>In conclusion, under the given circumstances governments need to evaluate costs and benefits of different&nbsp;policy options and adopt the measures that maximize net social benefits.</li>

<li>The exchange rate essentially reflects the external value of&nbsp;a country's currency. According to the economic theory&nbsp;it is determined by the demand and supply forces on the&nbsp;foreign exchange market and represents the rate at which&nbsp;one currency can be exchanged for another currency.<br>In outlining the determination of exchange rate of a&nbsp;particular country we will make the assumption that the&nbsp;two countries are involved, namely Pakistan and US.&nbsp;The exchange rate is, therefore, US$ in terms of Rs.&nbsp;Consider the following graph:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/94caafa75eff299d451f2edc81caac0f" alt="" width="367" height="231"><br><br>Demand for $ is drawn downward sloping because lower&nbsp;the price of $ in terms of Rs, the cheaper it is to import&nbsp;goods and services from US or to buy assets in US and&nbsp;therefore, the higher the quantity demanded of $. While&nbsp;the supply curve of $ is upward sloping because a higher&nbsp;price of $ in terms of Rs. makes it cheaper for US&nbsp;buyers and investors to import Pakistani goods or buy&nbsp;assets in Pakistan. Thus the intersection of demand and&nbsp;supply gives an exchange rate Rs. 100 = 1 $<br>However, there are a number of influences on both the&nbsp;demand and supply of currencies which shift the equilibrium&nbsp;and therefore may cause fluctuations in exchange&nbsp;rate. In order to avoid these fluctuations, the authorities&nbsp;could attempt to maintain their rate at a predetermined&nbsp;level. In that case the central bank of the country&nbsp;maintains the rate of exchange through buying and selling&nbsp;of currencies on day to day basis in the forex market.&nbsp;Continuing with our example let's assume that Pakistani&nbsp;authorities seek to stabilize exchange rate at Rs. 100 =&nbsp;1 $. Suppose now there is an increase in demand for $&nbsp;represented by a shift in the demand curve to the right&nbsp;to D<sub>2</sub> as shown in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ca3b36f5630b5574e0658945df4b8aef" alt="" width="365" height="235"><br><br>This could be the result of either an increase in demand&nbsp;for US exports to Pakistan or increase in US interest&nbsp;rate at relatively higher level attracting investment from&nbsp;Pakistan. Without official intervention the exchange rate&nbsp;would now rise to Rs. 102 = 1 $, which is above the fixed&nbsp;rate. In this situation government, through its central&nbsp;bank, would be forced to buy Rs. and hence supply $&nbsp;equal to a b from its official foreign currency reserves.&nbsp;This would shift the supply curve to S<sub>2</sub> and hence would&nbsp;eliminate the downward pressure on Rs.<br>On the contrary if Pakistani exports to US rise or US&nbsp;investors want to buy into Rs. to take advantage of&nbsp;higher interest rate on offer in Pakistani bank accounts,&nbsp;they will swap their $ for Rs. This will increase the&nbsp;demand for Rs. in the foreign exchange markets, and in&nbsp;the absence of official intervention, will cause Rs. to&nbsp;appreciate. Now in order to prevent appreciation of Rs.&nbsp;Pakistani authorities would sell Rs. in order to buy any&nbsp;surplus of $ at the targeted exchange rate.<br>Thus government can stabilize exchange rate by buying&nbsp;and selling currencies in order to remove shortages or&nbsp;surpluses in the foreign exchange market.</li>
<li>A persistent upwards and downwards movements in&nbsp;consumer price index (CPI) reflects unstable domestic&nbsp;price level while a frequent fluctuation in exchange rate&nbsp;is an indication of an unstable exchange rate.<br>Fluctuating rates of inflation, particularly if they are&nbsp;unexpected, disturb the distribution of income and wealth&nbsp;and therefore profoundly affect the existing social order.&nbsp;In times of rising price level, for instance, people on&nbsp;fixed incomes and those in a weak bargaining position&nbsp;become poorer whereas those who can use their economic&nbsp;power to gain large pay rent or profit gain. There&nbsp;is also a redistribution of income from borrowers to&nbsp;lenders which discourages savings.<br>Moreover, it tends to cause uncertainty among the&nbsp;business community. If it is difficult for firms to predict&nbsp;their costs and revenues, they may be discouraged from&nbsp;investing. This will reduce the rate of economic growth.&nbsp;It also requires firms to use extra resources to cope with&nbsp;the effects of fluctuation in inflation. Accountants and&nbsp;other financial experts, for instance, may have to be&nbsp;employed by companies to help them cope with the&nbsp;uncertainties or extra costs have to be incurred to change&nbsp;price labels, or prices in catalogues or menus, or adjust&nbsp;slot machines.<br>Uncertainty caused by unstable price level also affects&nbsp;the country's foreign trade. If, for instance, a country&nbsp;suffers from relatively high inflation, its exports will&nbsp;become less competitive in the world market. At the&nbsp;same time, imports will become relatively cheaper than&nbsp;home-produced goods. Thus exports will fall and imports&nbsp;will rise. In the short term, the effect on export&nbsp;and import demand tends to be low because of low&nbsp;price elasticity of demand. In the long run, however, the&nbsp;risk associated with unstable price level might result&nbsp;in an unstable exchange rate and balance of payment&nbsp;problem.<br>On the other hand an unstable exchange rate can lead to&nbsp;uncertainty in foreign sector both for traders and investors&nbsp;particularly when fluctuations are large and frequent.&nbsp;To a certain extent, however, the risk can be reduced by&nbsp;the use of 'forward markets' where the traders can 'hedge'&nbsp;against the risk of a change in exchange rate by agreeing&nbsp;with a forex dealer a particular rate for a particular date&nbsp;in future. However, it is believed that the changes in the&nbsp;external value of a country's currency might deter long-term foreign investment or might make firms reluctant&nbsp;to negotiate long run trade contracts.<br>Moreover, frequent changes in exchange rate can have&nbsp;serious repercussions in the domestic economy. When&nbsp;a country's currency appreciates, its exports become&nbsp;less competitive in world market, and industries which&nbsp;produce import substitutes find it more difficult to compete&nbsp;in the domestic economy because imports become&nbsp;relatively cheaper. However, if the demands for imports&nbsp;and exports are highly price inelastic, such that (PED<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;+ PED<sub>m</sub>) is less than 1, a depreciation will worsen trade&nbsp;balance while an appreciation is likely to improve it.&nbsp;Through fluctuations in trade balance it, therefore, causes&nbsp;the domestic price level, domestic output and unemployment&nbsp;rate to fluctuate and thus brings instability in&nbsp;the economy as a whole.<br>Also, an unstable exchange rate over a period time might&nbsp;erode the confidence of both foreign buyers of the&nbsp;country's goods and local buyers of foreign goods. It is,&nbsp;therefore, likely to reduce the level of trade and thus&nbsp;deprives the country of all the benefits associated with&nbsp;specialization and trade.<br>In addition, fluctuation in exchange rate usually gives&nbsp;rise to speculation that can lead to even greater fluctuations.&nbsp;If, for instance, an appreciation of foreign currency&nbsp;is expected speculators will purchase it in bulkthe&nbsp;result being a depreciation of the local currency,&nbsp;possibly greater than the one which was expected. On&nbsp;the contrary if they expect local currency to rise in&nbsp;value they start buying local currency and thus cause an&nbsp;even larger increase in its value.<br>Thus changes in the exchange rate can also have powerful&nbsp;effects on the macro economy affecting variables&nbsp;such as the demand for exports and imports, real output&nbsp;growth, inflation, business profits and jobs.<br>From the discussion above it follows that domestic price&nbsp;level and exchange rate are, to a large extent, interconnected&nbsp;in the sense that stability in price level can&nbsp;reduce fluctuations in exchange rate and vice versa.&nbsp;However, in most cases, government should be more&nbsp;concerned with the unstable domestic price level for its&nbsp;much wider impact on the economy. Therefore we&nbsp;conclude that low and stable rate of inflation is an&nbsp;important policy target but the stability in exchange rate&nbsp;cannot be ignored at the same time.</li>

Such&nbsp;goods are characterized by excludability, rivalry and&nbsp;rejectability. Exclusion simply implies that anyone who&nbsp;does not pay for train travel can be excluded from the&nbsp;benefits of services while rivalry suggests that the space&nbsp;available in a train is limited and a seat occupied by one&nbsp;reduces the number of seats available to others.&nbsp;Rejectability refers to the choice available to individuals&nbsp;to travel by train or use some other mode of transportation.</p>
<p><br>Though train services are classified as private goods and&nbsp;therefore, the private sector can provide them yet in&nbsp;most countries they are provided by the government for&nbsp;a number of reasons.<br>Firstly, train services require development of extensive&nbsp;logistics and infrastructure that require careful planning&nbsp;and huge investment. Governments usually have the capacity&nbsp;to plan, develop and operate the train system&nbsp;which would facilitate and integrate economic activities.&nbsp;Private sector does not make investments on the basis&nbsp;of developing social infrastructure rather they view only&nbsp;commercial viability of a particular project make investment&nbsp;only in profitable project.</p>
<p><br>Secondly, train service is an important means of mass&nbsp;transit and transportation of goods around the globe. It&nbsp;is recognized as efficient, safe and cost effective alternative&nbsp;to highway bus and air travel. Comparing train&nbsp;travel with other travelling modes statistically, we find&nbsp;that it is undoubtedly safer and more reliable. The other&nbsp;modes of travelling, particularly road travelling, result in&nbsp;higher number of traffic accidents and loss of precious&nbsp;lives or fatal injuries. Thus the increasing provision of&nbsp;train services could prevent dozens of casualties and&nbsp;hundreds of injuries. At the same time, rail traffic mitigates&nbsp;the overburdened network of highways and primary&nbsp;roads, which contributes to a smooth and safe&nbsp;road transport and ensures better prevention from damages and losses in road accidents. Thus train services&nbsp;not only benefits the user but more so they generate fair&nbsp;amount of social benefits. Therefore leaving it to the&nbsp;private sector might result in under provision leading to&nbsp;a welfare loss.</p>
<p><br>Thirdly, the ongoing continuous growth of both population&nbsp;and production of goods and services requires&nbsp;speedy, punctual, reliable and flexible transportations&nbsp;day by day. Millions of people travelling and tons of&nbsp;goods transported each day by various traffic modes&nbsp;have an impact on the quality of environment for which&nbsp;private sector has little regard. Thus with the objective&nbsp;of common good providing transportation in an environmentally&nbsp;friendly manner the provision of train services&nbsp;network in all parts of the country becomes an integral&nbsp;component of various government policy objectives.&nbsp;Unlike government the private sector will view profit as&nbsp;the major goal therefore will provide these services to&nbsp;the limited profitable areas at relatively higher prices&nbsp;ignoring the less profitable or loss making routs.</p>
<p><br>Lastly, train services are also considered strategically&nbsp;important because incase of emergency the railways&nbsp;transport arms, ammunition and men from one part of&nbsp;the country to the other part. In case of famine, floods,&nbsp;epidemics and other disasters, government use the railways&nbsp;to carry food and medicines quickly to the part&nbsp;of the country, where they are needed.<br>However in some countries train services are provided&nbsp;by the private sector but they operate under a time&nbsp;limited franchised arrangement. In that case the government's role is to set the safety and regulatory&nbsp;environment. At times government also gives grants for&nbsp;the establishment of facilities and to support environmental&nbsp;benefits of certain traffics being moved from road&nbsp;to rail if that would bring a proven societal benefit to&nbsp;the environment. Thus in some countries train services&nbsp;are provided by the private sector but the governments&nbsp;continue to operate as a regulator with the goal of maximizing&nbsp;net benefits to the society.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 227</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8737</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, using elasticity of demand, why a train company&nbsp;might introduce a policy of raising fares at busy&nbsp;travel times and lowering fares at less busy travel times.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The relevant concept in the context of tram company's&nbsp;policy is price elasticity of demand (PED). Economists&nbsp;define PED as a numerical measure of the sensitivity of&nbsp;quantity demanded of a product to change in product's&nbsp;own price. Economists measure the degree of PED as:</p>
<p>Ed = (percentage change in the quantity demanded)/(percentage change in the price of the product)</p>
<p>PED coefficient tells us the percent change in the quantity&nbsp;demanded for a good following a given change in the&nbsp;price of that good. Negative coefficient of PED suggests&nbsp;the negative slope of a normal demand curve. However,&nbsp;it is normally the convention to ignore the negative sign&nbsp;and concentrate on the value of the figure .</p>
<p>Demand is said to be price elastic (Ed&gt; 1) when a given&nbsp;change in price results in a proportionately larger change&nbsp;in quantity demanded while it is price inelastic (Ed &lt; 1)&nbsp;when a given change in price leads to a proportionately&nbsp;smaller change in quantity demanded. In case of unitary&nbsp;elastic demand (Ed= I) both price and quantity demanded&nbsp;change by the same proportion.</p>
<p>In extreme cases PED is either perfectly inelastic&nbsp;(Ed = 0) where a price change results in no change in&nbsp;quantity demanded or perfectly elastic (Ed = infinite)&nbsp;when a small increase in price results in quantity demanded&nbsp;to fall to zero. As a rule we can say that the&nbsp;higher the numerical value of PED, the greater the responsiveness&nbsp;of quantity demanded to change in price&nbsp;and vice versa.</p>
<p>A train company might introduce the policy of raising&nbsp;fares at busy travel times and lowering fares at less&nbsp;busy travel times due to the different PED conditions.&nbsp;In the former case people may not have other less&nbsp;expensive and efficient modes of traveling available thus&nbsp;registering inelastic demand. In addition traveling during&nbsp;these timings could not be postponed or travelers might&nbsp;be depending more on the safety and punctuality of&nbsp;train system to reach their work places or business&nbsp;meetings. While in the latter case PED is likely to be&nbsp;elastic because there may be other less expensive modes&nbsp;of transport available or majority may not be traveling&nbsp;out of necessity but may just be taking leisure trips&nbsp;which could be postponed if fare increases.</p>
<p>In such elasticity conditions, the policy of varying fare&nbsp;in busy and less busy times will have positive impact&nbsp;on the total revenue earned by the train company. Total&nbsp;revenue is the amount that is earned by a firm from the&nbsp;sale of a product and is calculated by multiplying per&nbsp;unit price of the product with the total quantity sold&nbsp;(TR= P x Q).<br>The graph below illustrates the impact of lowering fares&nbsp;on TR in less busy travel time.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a5b0b5ee74795e8c159e5f8b1fa743ff" alt="" width="306" height="189"><br><br>On the elastic range of demand curve the rectangular&nbsp;area labeled as fall in revenue is the result of decrease&nbsp;in price from P to P<sub>1</sub> while the area indicating a rise in&nbsp;revenue is generated by the resulting increase in the&nbsp;quantity demanded from q to q<sub>1</sub>. Since the larger proportionate&nbsp;change in quantity demanded outweighs the&nbsp;smaller proportionate fall in price, therefore, the policy&nbsp;of lowering fares results in an increase in TR earned by&nbsp;the train company.<br>Following graph shows the situation of busy travel time&nbsp;with inelastic demand.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/30ba03eba195536490f06e2303cf5d03" alt="" width="278" height="254"><br><br>On the inelastic range of demand curve increase in price&nbsp;from P to&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub> reduces quantity demanded by a smaller&nbsp;proportion than price. Thus the rise in price outweighs&nbsp;the resulting fall in quantity and it, therefore, generates&nbsp;a bigger effect on the company's TR.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that the policy of charging&nbsp;high and low fares in different travel timings with different&nbsp;PED conditions is likely to increase TR of the&nbsp;train company.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 228</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8736</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether an economy's production possibility&nbsp;curve is more likely to move inward or outward over&nbsp;time.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A production possibility curve (PPC) shows all possible&nbsp;combinations of two goods that a country can&nbsp;produce within a specified time period with the given&nbsp;state of technology when all its resources fully and&nbsp;efficiently employed. The idea of production possibilities&nbsp;is usually shown graphically as given below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a3d2d9cb074defd7b31d4df13c1ee316" alt="" width="308" height="262"></p>
<p>Each point on the PPC represents maximum output of&nbsp;capital goods and consumer goods. The country must&nbsp;achieve full employment and productive efficiency in&nbsp;order to operate at any point on the PPC. However, if&nbsp;the economy were at point G, there would be unemployed&nbsp;resources and by bringing those resources into&nbsp;use the economy could move to any point on the PPC.&nbsp;Points outside the frontier such as H are unattainable&nbsp;with the current supplies of resources and technology.&nbsp;The negative slope of the PPC can be viewed in terms&nbsp;of opportunity cost, which shows that obtaining more&nbsp;of one type of output requires having less of the other.&nbsp;A PPC is drawn on the assumptions that the quantity&nbsp;and productivity of resources remain fixed and the&nbsp;economy is employing all its available resources to&nbsp;produce goods and services at the least cost. Though, economies&nbsp;may gain or lose resources over a period of time.&nbsp;Such changes could move the PPC of an economy to a&nbsp;new position. Figures below illustrate the outcome of&nbsp;the changes in the quantity and quality of resources.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/208efe5a4c54c29e627bf1aa4543a79a" alt="" width="429" height="209"></p>
<p>Fig. 1 shows outward movement resulting in expanded&nbsp;production possibilities while Fig. 2 shows inward&nbsp;movement reflecting a decline in productive potential.</p>
<p>An outward movement in an economy's PPC could result&nbsp;from an increase in either the quantity or improvement&nbsp;in the productivity of its resources. Over a period of&nbsp;time if, for instance, the working population of the&nbsp;economy grows its PPC would shift outward as there&nbsp;would be more workers available to work. However, if&nbsp;the size of working population decreases the economy's&nbsp;PPC moves inward. These changes in working population&nbsp;could result either from varying size and composition&nbsp;of population or the changing participation rate.&nbsp;Similarly, improvement in labour productivity resulting&nbsp;from new skills, improved education, training and better&nbsp;health increases the economy's productive potential,&nbsp;hence shifts the PPC outward. On the contrary, a decline&nbsp;in labour productivity, say due to the worsening health&nbsp;conditions, could move its PPC inward.</p>
<p>Position of an economy's PPC also depends on its level&nbsp;of capital stock available. If, over a period of time, the&nbsp;economy manages to add more capital than the amount&nbsp;of capital becoming obsolete its PPC is likely to move&nbsp;outward. However, if the economy fails to add more&nbsp;capital than the amount of capital that wears out its&nbsp;PPC could shift inward. These changes in the stock of&nbsp;capital result from the level of investment that depends&nbsp;on the sentiments of business people about future&nbsp;demand and profitability, tax regimes, the rate of growth&nbsp;of economy and interest rate.</p>
<p>Outward movement of PPC is not always the outcome&nbsp;of more capital rather it could also result from technical&nbsp;progress leading to higher productivity of machines and&nbsp;tools. Much of the investment in research and development&nbsp;aims at producing not just extra machines but&nbsp;superior machines. Thus if most of the investment is&nbsp;made in superior machines producing higher output from&nbsp;the given amount of resources then the outcome is an&nbsp;outward shift in PPC.</p>
<p><br>Furthermore, if a country strikes luck and discovers vast&nbsp;new deposits of coal, oil or some other minerals its&nbsp;productive potential and hence the PPC would move&nbsp;outward. On the contrary, depletion of some important&nbsp;natural resource, say due to excessive extraction, could&nbsp;shift the PPC inward.</p>
<p>In particular cases, inward shift in PPC could also result&nbsp;from the destruction of productive resources caused by&nbsp;natural calamities such as flood, draught, earthquake.&nbsp;Likewise a country suffering from political unrest or&nbsp;war with other countries may also have similar impact&nbsp;on its productive resources and PPC.<br>Thus it can be concluded that movement of an economy's&nbsp;PPC over a period of time largely depends on the quantity&nbsp;and productivity of its available resources. Increasing&nbsp;quantities and/or improvement in productivity of natural,&nbsp;manmade and human resources could result in an&nbsp;outward movement while a decrease in the quantity and&nbsp;productivity of these inputs may cause the PPC to shift&nbsp;inward.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 229</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8735</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why all types of economic system benefit from&nbsp;the existence and use of money.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Strictly in economic terms anything which is generally&nbsp;acceptable in purchasing goods or settling debts is called&nbsp;money while an economic system comprises of all the&nbsp;institutional means through which scarce national resources&nbsp;are used to satisfy human wants. Economists&nbsp;classify economic systems as free market, planned and&nbsp;mixed economic system.</p>
<p>A free market is typically characterized by limited involvement&nbsp;of government in the economy coupled with&nbsp;individual ownership of the means of production. Individuals&nbsp;can pursue their own self-interest without many&nbsp;constraints. Free market is thus one where decisions are&nbsp;decentralized and resource allocation takes place through&nbsp;price system, also known as invisible hand.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in a command economy government&nbsp;controls the factor of production and makes all key decisions&nbsp;about their use and about the distribution of&nbsp;income. Thus decision making is a centralized process.&nbsp;The complete opposite of the pure self-interest of the&nbsp;free market system, consumers, workers and the government&nbsp;are all assumed to be working for the 'common&nbsp;good'. There is no competition, so there is no price&nbsp;mechanism. The authorities set the prices.</p>
<p><br>A mixed economy is where government actively participates&nbsp;in the economy by promoting economic stability&nbsp;and growth, providing certain goods and services which&nbsp;would be under produced or not produced at all by market&nbsp;forces. A mixed economy could mean anything depending&nbsp;on the degree of the mix of public and private sector.&nbsp;In all different types of economic systems the existence&nbsp;and use of money stimulates trade by making it easier&nbsp;to exchange through its four functions. As a medium of&nbsp;exchange money allows society to escape the complication&nbsp;of double coincidence that requires the need for&nbsp;both sides to want the good the other has to trade. It&nbsp;is cumbersome costly and difficult, if not impossible.&nbsp;Besides this large and bulky goods may be difficult to&nbsp;divide to facilitate exchanges. It, therefore reduces trade&nbsp;volumes and hence the level of specialization. Modern&nbsp;money is denominated in different values thus making&nbsp;it easier to buy and sell goods of different values.</p>
<p>As a unit of account money provides a scale to measure&nbsp;the relative worth of a wide variety of commodities,&nbsp;making possible the operation of price system in market&nbsp;and mixed economies. Thus it automatically provides&nbsp;the basis for keeping accounts, calculating profit and&nbsp;loss etc. It is very difficult under a barter system to&nbsp;establish agreed units of account as people's opinion of&nbsp;the value of certain items differ greatly.</p>
<p>Money also functions as a standard of deferred payments,&nbsp;the unit in which, given stability in its value,&nbsp;loans are made and future contracts fixed. Without money,&nbsp;there would be no common basis to allow for dealing in&nbsp;debts. By providing a standard for repayment, money&nbsp;makes borrowing and lending much easier.</p>
<p>Finally money acts as a store of wealth, the most convenient&nbsp;way of keeping any income which is surplus to&nbsp;immediate requirements. Because money is also the&nbsp;medium of exchange, wealth stored in this form is completely&nbsp;liquid: it can be converted into other goods&nbsp;immediately and without cost.</p>
<p><br>In a free market system or in private part of a mixed&nbsp;economy at least, existence of money and its use in&nbsp;terms of determining prices at which commodities are&nbsp;provided have an essential impact on the allocation of&nbsp;resources, production and distribution of goods and&nbsp;services. Money, therefore, plays a more dynamic and&nbsp;significant role in such economic systems. However,&nbsp;according to the logic of the command economy, the&nbsp;availability of money and the prices at which commodities&nbsp;and products are provided should have no significant&nbsp;impact on the allocation of resources and production&nbsp;or distribution of goods and services because the&nbsp;role of markets and hence prices are overpowered by&nbsp;the authorities.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 230</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8734</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Current Account Balances 2006-2010</strong></p>

<li>In 2006 Russia had a current account surplus of $94.3 billion and that the United States had a current&nbsp;account deficit of $803.5. Over the period, however, Russia's surplus, though fluctuated, but persisted&nbsp;and remained at $62 billion at the end of 2010 while the deficit in the United States had reduced to $324. 7&nbsp;billion.</li>
<li>Superior factor endowment may have enabled China to emerge as a more cost competitive country than&nbsp;India in the international market. The availability of large amount of skilled labour and raw materials, in&nbsp;particular, might have resulted in comparatively low prices of Chinese products and therefore relatively&nbsp;higher volumes of its exports and lower volumes of imports. Secondly, Chinese authorities may have&nbsp;deliberately maintained Chinese exchange rate at a lower level. Thus an undervalued Chinese exchange rate&nbsp;might have made its exports cheaper and imports relatively dearer leading to a stronger trade performance&nbsp;than India.</li>
<li>A recessionary period is characterized by a sustained drop in the level of economic activity. Thus a global&nbsp;recession would lead to a decline in the worldwide incomes and hence spending leading to a fall in both&nbsp;global export and import volumes and hence a decline in international trade. The impact on different&nbsp;economies, however, might vary because the income elasticity of demand for exports and imports may differ&nbsp;according to the type of products that each economy trades.<br>This would mean that those economies producing exports with negative income elasticity of demand would&nbsp;be expected to benefit in terms of improvement in their trade balance. However, the economies exporting&nbsp;goods with high and positive income elasticity of demand are likely to experience a worsening trade balance.&nbsp;Thus overall international trade volume is likely to decline but the impact on individual economies might&nbsp;vary.</li>
<li>Current account surpluses are seen as desirable for two reasons. First, it is assumed that exports create&nbsp;jobs whilst imports destroy jobs. Therefore the more exports and the fewer imports for an economy, the&nbsp;healthier the economy will be. Second, current account surpluses are seen as desirable because they are&nbsp;associated with capital or financial accountdeficit. A capital or financial account deficit means that the&nbsp;country is a net saver internationally. A persistent deficit on capital or financial account is likely to result&nbsp;in growing international wealth. This wealth should generate interest, profits and dividends which can be&nbsp;repatriated to provide an income for the country.</li>
<li>An expenditure-reducing policy is any action taken by a government that is designed to reduce the total&nbsp;level of spending in an economy. These policies include deflationary fiscal policy and monetary measures.&nbsp;The former means raising taxes and reducing government expenditure. Raising taxes will reduce disposable&nbsp;incomes meaning that less will be available to spend on imports. In addition the reduced government&nbsp;spending will depress incomes further. While the latter implies raising interest rates and reducing the money&nbsp;supply. In addition to attracting inflows of foreign capital that will increase the demand for the currency&nbsp;on the foreign exchange market, increases in the rate of interest will reduce the money supply and deflate&nbsp;the economy. This is because the higher interest rate will reduce the demand for loans for consumption&nbsp;and investment and lead to a fall in aggregate monetary demand.<br>These policies will have two principal effects. First, a reduction in spending will mean that there will be&nbsp;fewer purchases of imported goods and services. Secondly, domestic producers will find that their domestic&nbsp;market is 'dampened' and is more difficult to sell in. As a result they may try to make up for the decrease&nbsp;in sales domestically with increases in sales abroad. The overall impact therefore should be a fall in imports&nbsp;and a rise in exports.<br>These policies are particularly effective in the situation when the economy undergoes a period of high&nbsp;inflation and current account deficit. However, they are considered as highly risky policies because their&nbsp;dampening impact might induce negative sentiments among the investors who then may cut back on their&nbsp;investment plans and thus thrust the economy into recession.<br>Finally, these policies could be used in times when high rate of inflation and current account deficit coexist.&nbsp;However, a persistent long term use of such policies could conflict with other government objectives, namely&nbsp;the achievement of economic growth and full employment.</li>

The rate of inflation is measured by the&nbsp;annual percentage change in the level of consumer prices.</p>
<p>Economists make a simple distinction between demand&nbsp;pull and cost push inflation.</p>
<p>Demand pull inflation is largely the result of the level&nbsp;of AD being allowed to grow too fast compared to what&nbsp;the supply-side capacity can meet. The result is excess&nbsp;demand for goods and services and pressure on businesses&nbsp;to raise prices in order to increase their profit&nbsp;margins. So, if aggregate demand rises firms will respond&nbsp;to a rise in demand partly by raising prices and partly&nbsp;by increasing output. Just how much they raise prices&nbsp;depends on how much their costs rise as a result of&nbsp;increasing output. In other words, it will depend on the&nbsp;shape of the AS curve. The effect is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e7c13837b90817b5b02d02ed0347443f" alt="" width="321" height="240"></p>
<p>The rise in aggregate demand is illustrated by a rightward&nbsp;shift in the aggregate demand curve, from AD<sub>1</sub> to&nbsp;AD<sub>2</sub>. Prices rise from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, and output rises from&nbsp;Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub>. The steeper the aggregate supply curve, the&nbsp;more prices will rise and the less output will increase.</p>
<p>The aggregate supply curve will tend to become steeper&nbsp;as the economy approaches the peak of the business&nbsp;cycle. Thus it follows that the closer the actual output&nbsp;gets to potential output, and the less slack there is in&nbsp;the economy, the more will firms respond to a rise in&nbsp;demand by raising their prices.</p>
<p>These rises in aggregate demand may be due to the&nbsp;changes in the behavior of consumers, businesses and&nbsp;government. For instance, increases in consumer demand&nbsp;say due to expectations of higher prices in future, will&nbsp;increase AD and hence the price level. On the part of&nbsp;government a fiscal stimulus such as a cut in direct or&nbsp;indirect taxation or increasing government spending by&nbsp;borrowing from banking system feed through directly&nbsp;into extra demand in the circular flow.</p>
<p>Also a monetary stimulus by the authorities such as&nbsp;increasing money supply or lowering of interest rate&nbsp;stimulates consumer spending by households and investment&nbsp;spending by firms leading to an increase in AD&nbsp;and thus demand pull inflation. However if AD rises&nbsp;due to increased investment by businesses which increases&nbsp;capacity sufficiently to absorb all the extra&nbsp;demand, there will be no demand pull inflation.</p>
<p>Cost push inflation, on the contrary, is associated with&nbsp;leftward (upward) shift in the aggregate supply curve.&nbsp;Such shifts occur when costs of production rise independently&nbsp;of aggregate demand. If firms face a rise in&nbsp;costs, they will respond partly by raising prices and&nbsp;passing the costs to the consumer and partly by cutting&nbsp;back on production. This is shown by the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/53e4d9b978f955ee63846f350c0abaeb" alt="" width="312" height="239"></p>
<p>There is a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve:&nbsp;from AS<sub>1</sub>, to AS<sub>2</sub>. This causes the price level to rise to&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub> and the level of output to fall to Y<sub>2</sub>. Just how much&nbsp;firms raise prices and cut back on production depends&nbsp;on the shape of the aggregate demand curve. The less&nbsp;elastic the AD curve, the less will sales fall as a result&nbsp;of any price rise, and hence the more will firms be able&nbsp;to pass on the rise in their costs to consumers as higher&nbsp;prices.</p>
<p>Again this rise in costs could be caused by the changes&nbsp;in the behavior of firms and government. As a result we&nbsp;can distinguish between various types of supply shocks&nbsp;and hence cost push inflation:</p>
<p>Firstly, inflation caused by the producers called profit-push&nbsp;inflation. This is where firms use their monopoly&nbsp;power to make bigger profits by pushing up prices independently&nbsp;of consumer demand. For example the&nbsp;decisions of the major utility companies providing electricity,&nbsp;gas or water on their prices for the year ahead,&nbsp;or the price increase by the leading food retailers based&nbsp;on the strength of demand and competitive pressure in&nbsp;their markets.</p>
<p>Secondly, tax-push inflation. This is where increased taxation&nbsp;adds to the cost of living. For example, a rise in&nbsp;indirect tax rates such as VAT causes an increased domestic&nbsp;inflation because it increases a firm's production&nbsp;costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, import-push inflation. This is when the government&nbsp;devalues its currency or allows the foreign&nbsp;exchange to depreciate as part of its exchange rate policy.&nbsp;This causes prices of imported raw material and hence&nbsp;cost of production to increase leading to a cost push&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that the source of inflation in&nbsp;an economy could be either the behavior of consumer&nbsp;businesses or government. However empirical evidence&nbsp;suggests that it is largely the behavior of government&nbsp;that stimulates price level in an economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 232</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8732</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why the successful operation of the division of&nbsp;labour depends upon the use of money.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Division of labour involves the process of production&nbsp;to be broken up into many separate tasks each performed&nbsp;by one person or by a small group of people&nbsp;specializing in performing those particular tasks.<br>Division of labour allows each person to do what he or&nbsp;she can do well while leaving everything else to be done&nbsp;by others. As a result a person who concentrates on one&nbsp;activity becomes better at it than could a jack-of-all trades.&nbsp;This brings a variety of skills among workers&nbsp;and makes it easier and less costly for firms to train&nbsp;them. Also it allows firms to benefit from specialist&nbsp;machinery and gain from economizing in the use of tools.<br>Thus division of labour allows businesses to produce&nbsp;standardized goods on a large scale. The result is higher&nbsp;output, lower per unit cost and improved quality. A&nbsp;higher output at lower costs means economic progress&nbsp;as more wants and needs might be satisfied with a given&nbsp;amount of scarce resources.<br>However in order to fully benefit from division of labour&nbsp;the resulting higher output must be traded with the potential&nbsp;for gains in welfare for all parties. It, therefore,&nbsp;follows that successful operation of division of labour&nbsp;requires an efficient medium of exchange. Since money&nbsp;avoids the use of barter and the need for a double&nbsp;coincidence of wants therefore, makes trade more efficient.&nbsp;Acting as a unit of account and a medium of&nbsp;exchange it also simplifies the trading process. The store&nbsp;of value and standard of deferred payment functions&nbsp;encourage saving and investment and hence foster efficiency&nbsp;and economic progress.<br>We define money as anything which is generally acceptable&nbsp;in purchasing goods or settling debts. It need not&nbsp;consist of coins and notes. There are examples in the&nbsp;history when oxen, salt, cotton cloth and cigarettes have&nbsp;been used as money.<br>Money stimulates trade by making it easier to exchange&nbsp;through its functions. Firstly, as a medium of exchange&nbsp;money allows society to escape the complication of&nbsp;double coincidence that requires the need for both sides&nbsp;to want the good the other has to trade. It is cumbersome&nbsp;costly and difficult, if not impossible. Besides this&nbsp;large and bulky goods may be difficult to divide to&nbsp;facilitate exchanges. It therefore reduces trade volumes&nbsp;and restrains the use of specialization and division of&nbsp;labour. On the contrary money is denominated in different&nbsp;values thus making it easier to buy and sell goods&nbsp;of different values.<br>As a unit of account money provides a scale to measure&nbsp;the relative worth of a wide variety of commodities,&nbsp;making possible the operation of a price system and&nbsp;automatically providing the basis for keeping accounts,&nbsp;calculating profit and loss etc. In a barter system it is&nbsp;difficult to establish agreed units of account as people's&nbsp;opinion of the value of certain items differ greatly making&nbsp;it even more difficult to trade.<br>Money also functions as a standard of deferred payments,&nbsp;the unit in which, given stability in its value,&nbsp;loans are made and future contracts fixed. Without money,&nbsp;there would be no common basis to allow for dealing in&nbsp;debts. By providing a standard for repayment, money&nbsp;makes borrowing and lending much easier and therefore&nbsp;makes it possible to borrow and make large scale investments&nbsp;where division of labour can be applied.<br>Thus it can be concluded that money, by facilitating&nbsp;trade, has contributed a great deal to the successful&nbsp;operation of division of labour.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 233</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8731</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Suggest two possible reasons why a government might&nbsp;increase the indirect tax on such goods and discuss, in&nbsp;light of these reasons, the likely effectiveness of such&nbsp;a policy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An indirect tax is imposed on producers/suppliers by&nbsp;the government. Examples include excise duties on selected&nbsp;items or general sales tax across the board on all&nbsp;products. Governments levy these taxes for a number&nbsp;of reasons - among them, as part of a strategy, is to&nbsp;restrict consumption of certain products and, more&nbsp;importantly, to generate revenue for its spending.&nbsp;The introduction of an indirect tax increases the costs&nbsp;of a business therefore, causes a fall (leftward shift) in&nbsp;the supply curve. The vertical distance between the pre-tax&nbsp;and the post-tax supply curve shows the tax per&nbsp;unit. With an indirect tax, the supplier may be able to&nbsp;pass on some or all of this tax onto the consumer through&nbsp;a higher price. This is known as shifting the burden of&nbsp;the tax. However, the ability of businesses to do this&nbsp;depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply.&nbsp;This is illustrated on the figure below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/14b92402dac15c7f8bbf5c85a82edebc" alt="" width="428" height="270"><br><br>In the diagram above, demand is elastic meaning that&nbsp;demand is responsive to a change in price. The producer&nbsp;must absorb most of the tax itself i.e. accept a lower&nbsp;profit margin on each unit sold. When demand is elastic,&nbsp;the effect of a tax is to raise the price - but we see a&nbsp;bigger fall in equilibrium quantity. Output has fallen from&nbsp;Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub> due to a contraction in demand. The shaded&nbsp;area labeled as consumer and producer burden of tax&nbsp;represents government's tax revenue.<br>Conversely when demand is inelastic the producer can&nbsp;pass on most of the tax to the consumer by raising the&nbsp;market price without losing too much in the way of&nbsp;sales. This is shown in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/460d305eb30455baaaf4f18b715ec662" alt="" width="412" height="278"><br><br>As mentioned earlier that the government tries to achieve&nbsp;two main objectives i.e. to restrict the consumption of&nbsp;certain goods and to raise revenue for its spending. If&nbsp;the primary objective of the government is to raise&nbsp;revenue then the government would rather increase indirect&nbsp;taxes on commodities where demand is inelastic.&nbsp;This is because the tax causes only a small fall in the&nbsp;quantity consumed and as a result the total revenue from&nbsp;taxes will be greater. An example of this is the high level&nbsp;of duty on cigarettes and petrol. The effect is illustrated&nbsp;on the figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/928e4041db9669a9fb555a829558c31f" alt="" width="388" height="314"><br><br>In the figure above, S + t<sub>1</sub> is the supply curve with normal&nbsp;tax rate. An increase in tax rate shifts the supply curve&nbsp;to S + t<sub>2</sub>. Price rises from P<sub>1</sub> to p<sub>2</sub> and quantity consumed&nbsp;decreases from q<sub>1</sub> to q<sub>2</sub>. It can be noted that the&nbsp;proportionate increase in price is larger than the proportionate&nbsp;fall in quantity consumed. The resulting changes&nbsp;in tax revenue are shown by the dark shaded rectangles&nbsp;and it can be noted that the rectangular area that measures&nbsp;the resulting increase in revenue is larger than the&nbsp;area measures the decrease in revenue thus resulting in&nbsp;an overall increase in government tax revenue.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e667115474a8833526fa1ce2ba47bf06" alt="" width="369" height="310"><br><br>In the figure above, S+t<sub>1</sub> is the supply curve with normal&nbsp;tax rate. An increase in tax rate shifts the supply curve&nbsp;to S+ t<sub>2</sub>. Price rises from P<sub>1</sub> to p<sub>2</sub> and quantity consumed&nbsp;decreases from q<sub>1</sub> to q<sub>2</sub>· It can be noted that the&nbsp;proportionate increase in price is smaller than the proportionate&nbsp;fall in quantity consumed. The resulting&nbsp;changes in tax revenue are shown by the dark shaded&nbsp;rectangles and it can be noted that the rectangular area&nbsp;that measures the resulting increase in revenue is smaller&nbsp;than the area measures the decrease in revenue, thus&nbsp;resulting in an overall increase in government tax revenue.<br>From the above discussion it follows that if the prime&nbsp;motive of the government is to restrict consumption of&nbsp;certain goods then government needs to increase taxes&nbsp;on goods where demand is relatively elastic. This is&nbsp;because a relatively small increase in price caused by an&nbsp;increase in tax would reduce the consumption by proportionately&nbsp;larger quantity.<br>On the contrary, if the main objective is to raise finances&nbsp;then government should increase the tax rates on products&nbsp;which have relatively inelastic demand. This is&nbsp;because increase in price caused by increase in tax will&nbsp;bring a proportionately smaller fall in quantity consumed.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 234</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8730</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Using economic analysis, explain the possible causes of&nbsp;the increase in the sales of electronic goods, such as mp3 players, in recent years.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Sales of electronic goods refer to their quantities purchased&nbsp;at the given market prices per period of time. Economic analysis suggests that it is, usually, the outcome&nbsp;of the interaction of market demand and supply&nbsp;forces. So let's begin our analysis with the basic supply-demand&nbsp;diagram.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8b4602941cf9300092831dc034f0f8b7" alt="" width="321" height="203"><br><br>In the figure above the vertical axis shows the price of mp3 player, measured in Rs. per unit. The horizontal&nbsp;axis shows the quantity demanded and supplied, measured&nbsp;in number of units per period. The supply curve&nbsp;'S' tells us how much producers are willing to sell for&nbsp;each price that they receive in the market. The curve&nbsp;slopes upward because the higher the price, the more&nbsp;firms are usually able and willing to produce and sell.&nbsp;The demand curve 'D' tells us how much consumers are&nbsp;willing to buy for each price per unit that they must&nbsp;pay. It slopes downward because consumers are usually&nbsp;ready to buy more if the price is lower.<br>The two curves intersect at the equilibrium point 'e',&nbsp;indicating the market clearing price OP and sales OQ.&nbsp;At this point there is neither shortage nor excess supply&nbsp;i.e., quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are&nbsp;just equal. So, there is no pressure for the price to change.&nbsp;This equilibrium price and sales remain unaltered only so&nbsp;long as the demand and supply curves remain unchanged.&nbsp;If either of the curves shifts, a new equilibrium will be&nbsp;formed. Thus increase in sales of electronic goods can be&nbsp;attributed to increase in either of the market forces of&nbsp;demand and supply or both. The graph below illustrates&nbsp;the impact of increase in demand on price and sales.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/76e923c8468a1876d0841dae52a177b0" alt="" width="311" height="205"></p>
<p>A rise in demand to D<sub>1</sub> causes a shortage of e - a at the&nbsp;original price OP. As a result, market price increases&nbsp;leading to a movement along the supply curve from point&nbsp;e to e<sub>1</sub>, and a movement along the new demand curve&nbsp;from point 'a' to point e<sub>1</sub>. It can be noted that sales of&nbsp;mp3 rise from Q to Q<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>Most electronic goods are classified as normal goods&nbsp;therefore; there exists a positive relationship between&nbsp;the financial ability of the buyers and demand for these&nbsp;products. In recent years a post tax increase in purchasers'&nbsp;incomes or the availability of credit at low rate of&nbsp;interest can be attributed to this rise in demand for&nbsp;electronic products. Also nowhere the role of technological&nbsp;innovation is more evident than in the markets&nbsp;for electronic goods. As a result these products are more&nbsp;useful, reliable and efficient than ever before. This has&nbsp;made electronic products more attractive in general with&nbsp;the result of even higher demand and sales. In addition&nbsp;to this, the manufacturers these days are using extensive&nbsp;advertising for their products coupled with more effective&nbsp;marketing techniques. The credit for higher demand&nbsp;and hence higher sales of such product therefore goes to&nbsp;them for making people aware of the new features and&nbsp;in particular, the way in which these products can bring&nbsp;comfort and convenience in their routine lives.</p>
<p>Likewise, a rise in supply, with the given demand curve, will also lead to an increase in sales as illustrated in the&nbsp;figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/46ded427c3825a1d20b44f5b1b930c0d" alt="" width="371" height="240"><br><br>In the figure above a rise in supply to S<sub>1</sub> results in a&nbsp;surplus of e- a, at the original price OP. Thus the firms&nbsp;would reduce their prices in order to avoid accumulation&nbsp;of stocks. This would result in a downward movement&nbsp;along both the demand and supply curves to the new&nbsp;equilibrium point e<sub>1</sub>. The result is higher sales and lower&nbsp;price.<br>Electronic goods industries, in recent years, have gone&nbsp;through a phase of phenomenal improvement in technology&nbsp;which has led to a rise in the industry's workers&nbsp;productivity and a fall in the prices of components. This&nbsp;has led to a fall in the cost of production and hence an&nbsp;increase in their supply and sales. At the same time growing&nbsp;demand and swelling profits of the existing firms have&nbsp;made these industries more attractive for new firms.&nbsp;Consequently the increase in the size of the industry has&nbsp;also led to more firms producing even a higher output.&nbsp;Since higher sales of electronics, in recent times, is the&nbsp;result of both increase in demand and a simultaneous&nbsp;increase in supply of these products. Therefore we can&nbsp;extend our analysis to show a simultaneous change in&nbsp;both the market forces of demand and supply and their&nbsp;impact on price and sales.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/96c2d17b1449a70f176c6f566deeac46" alt="" width="356" height="237"><br><br>In the figure above the initial equilibrium is at P with&nbsp;the sales of q. An increase in demand puts an upward&nbsp;pressure on price. However, a simultaneous increase in&nbsp;supply puts a downward pressure on price. The resulting&nbsp;effect is that the equilibrium price remains unchanged,&nbsp;although there is a significant increase in sales. The&nbsp;outcome in terms of price depends on the proportion&nbsp;of increase in both the market forces however the outcome&nbsp;in terms of sales will definitely be an increase.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 235</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8729</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the accuracy of the definition of public and merit goods as 'goods that must be provided by the government'.&nbsp; [12]</p>

classified as&nbsp;public goods. These goods can be jointly consumed by&nbsp;many individuals at no additional cost.<br>Public goods possess two distinguishing characteristics&nbsp;i.e. they are non-excludable and non-rival.<br>Non-excludability entails that once these goods come&nbsp;into existence there is no effective way of excluding individuals&nbsp;from their benefits. Whilst non-rivalry means&nbsp;as more and more people consume the product; the&nbsp;benefit to those already consuming the product is not&nbsp;diminished.<br>These two features give rise to the free rider problem;&nbsp;people receiving benefits from a good without contributing&nbsp;to its cost. It entails a situation in which everyone&nbsp;believes that others will take on the burden of paying&nbsp;for public goods. Thus people may wish for the provision&nbsp;of such goods, but the demand may never be registered&nbsp;in the market.<br>The classic example of public goods is street lights. Their&nbsp;installation would be economically justified if benefits&nbsp;to the society exceed their production costs. But the&nbsp;benefits accruing to each individual user would not justify&nbsp;the purchase of such a large and indivisible product.&nbsp;Also once provided they would benefit all and no one&nbsp;can be excluded from benefitting the light if he chooses&nbsp;not to pay for them. Since the exclusion principle does&nbsp;not apply, therefore there is no economic incentive for&nbsp;private enterprises to supply them. Consequently the&nbsp;market forces fail to allocate resources for providing&nbsp;streetlights. Thus it follows that if society is to enjoy&nbsp;such goods and services they must be provided by the&nbsp;government and financed by compulsory charges in the&nbsp;form of taxes.<br>While the above discussion points out that market forces&nbsp;fail to allocate any resources to produce and provide public&nbsp;goods and, therefore, the government must provide these&nbsp;goods to the society with the view of common good. To&nbsp;this extent the definition in question seems appropriate;&nbsp;however it can be argued that goods such as public parks,&nbsp;libraries etc. do not fall in the category of public goods&nbsp;yet there can be a general consensus in the society that&nbsp;these goods must also be provided by the government and&nbsp;in many countries they are. In such cases the definition&nbsp;can be challenged and proven to be inaccurate.<br>Merit goods, on the other hand, create a divergence&nbsp;between the private and social costs and benefits of&nbsp;production and consumption thus leading to a risk of&nbsp;market failure. With the idea of a lack of information,&nbsp;a merit good is defined as a good that is better for a&nbsp;person than the person who may consume the good&nbsp;realizes. Thus the individuals who make decision about&nbsp;how much to consume do not fully appreciate the&nbsp;benefits of merit goods.<br>Good examples of merit goods include health services,&nbsp;education, work training programmes, public libraries etc.&nbsp;There is nothing inherent in any of these particular goods&nbsp;that makes them different from private goods. Thus these&nbsp;goods can be supplied through the market and in some&nbsp;countries they actually are. However, consumers may&nbsp;not be able to purchase or feel the need to consume&nbsp;them up to the correct level i.e. socially optimum level.&nbsp;Thus the free market forces would not provide them in&nbsp;the quantities that society ought to consume. This is&nbsp;illustrated in the graph below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8695f2c3c6c2ea398f91cfcc999452f8" alt="" width="512" height="381"><br><br>Here the correct level of demand, if consumer fully&nbsp;appreciated the true value of the product, would be D<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;(social benefit). This would lead to a market price gf P<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;where social benefit is equal to the supply of the product.&nbsp;This price would be associated with the socially&nbsp;optimum level of production and consumption of Q<sub>s</sub>,&nbsp;the ideal quantity of the good. However, demand is only&nbsp;registered as D<sub>2</sub> (private benefit), because consumers&nbsp;under-value the product. This leads to a market price of&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub> and thus production and consumption of Q<sub>p</sub>. This is&nbsp;below the optimum level, hence market has allocated&nbsp;insufficient amount of resources for the production of&nbsp;this good and, therefore resulted in welfare loss shown&nbsp;by the triangular area of ABC.<br>Thus it follows that a merit good is a product that society&nbsp;values and judges that everyone should have regardless&nbsp;of whether an individual wants them. In this sense, the&nbsp;government is acting paternally in providing merit goods&nbsp;and services. They believe that individuals may not act&nbsp;in their own best interest in part because of imperfect&nbsp;information about the benefits that can be derived.<br>It is important to realise that it is not simply the government&nbsp;(or public sector) that supplies merit goods.&nbsp;Both the state and private sector provide merit goods ＆&nbsp;services.<br>The discussion above suggests that the society feels that&nbsp;people will under-consume merit goods and they ought to&nbsp;be subsidised or perhaps provided free at the point of use&nbsp;by the government so that consumption does not depend&nbsp;primarily on the ability to pay for the good or service.&nbsp;In this context the definition in question seems inadequate.<br>Thus it can be concluded that merit goods, unlike public&nbsp;goods, are produced and provided by the market forces&nbsp;but the society judges that they would not be consumed&nbsp;to the correct level, therefore, government has to play a&nbsp;role to increase their production and consumption.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 236</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8728</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the role that a government should fulfil in a&nbsp;mixed economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A mixed economy is a mix of the two extremes, free&nbsp;market and planned economic system. It, therefore, could&nbsp;mean anything depending on the degree of mix.</p>
<p>The key features of such an economy include ownership&nbsp;of some of the country's factors of production&nbsp;publicly and some are owned privately. Thus, it involves&nbsp;both private and public sectors in the process of resource&nbsp;allocation. The price mechanism operates in the&nbsp;private sector; therefore, this part of the economy is&nbsp;motivated by self interest. Firms aim to maximise profit,&nbsp;consumers maximise their welfare and the factor owners&nbsp;maximise rent, interest and profit. On the other hand the&nbsp;government plans and runs the public sector with the&nbsp;goal of "common good".&nbsp;<br>The traditional role of a government&nbsp;is to protect the&nbsp;rights of individuals to keep private property. The government&nbsp;creates laws of ownership and contract and then&nbsp;provides the institutions to enforce these laws. In addition&nbsp;government has the authority to, issue currency&nbsp;and to prescribe weights and measures etc.</p>
<p>In a mixed economy the government goes well beyond&nbsp;these important basic functions. Not only does government&nbsp;directly control part of the economy, but it also&nbsp;intervenes in market transactions to correct what economists&nbsp;call market failures. These are well defined situations&nbsp;in which market forces do not effectively perform&nbsp;their coordinating function.</p>
<p>The first of these market failures is public goods such&nbsp;as national defense and street lights. These goods are&nbsp;not produced at all by markets because once provided,&nbsp;no one can be prevented from using them. The key point&nbsp;about public goods is that they are 'good' things, so they&nbsp;need to be provided, but, owing to their characteristics&nbsp;of non-excludability and non-rivalry, they have to be&nbsp;provided centrally by the government.<br>In other cases private sector allocates resources inefficiently,&nbsp;particularly in areas where goods are under&nbsp;consumed or over produced. With the idea of information&nbsp;failure, merit goods such as health care and education,&nbsp;are under produced and under consumed by the&nbsp;market forces. While demerit goods such as alcohol and&nbsp;tobacco smoking are over produced and over consumed.&nbsp;Government, in a mixed economy is required to intervene&nbsp;in order to correct these inefficiencies. Government&nbsp;can use various measures. ranging from financial&nbsp;intervention i.e. indirect tax and subsidy to improving&nbsp;information, regulation and direct provision. They have,&nbsp;therefore, become primarily a government activity.</p>
<p>In other cases cost is imposed called negative externality&nbsp;on those who are not the party of transactions. This is&nbsp;the case when factories pollute the air and rivers. Conversely&nbsp;it is possible that the social benefits of a decision&nbsp;exceed the private benefits. If this is the case then&nbsp;positive externality is said to exist. The problem created&nbsp;by externalities is that the market forces lead to inappropriate&nbsp;amount of the product involved being produced.&nbsp;Thus government has to step in to improve&nbsp;allocation of resources.</p>
<p>Reliance on market forces also generates inequalities of&nbsp;income and wealth. There is, therefore, a role of government&nbsp;to redistribute income and wealth through its taxation&nbsp;and expenditure policy. In order to achieve equitable&nbsp;distribution of income governments have developed&nbsp;welfare programmes - money collected through&nbsp;taxes is distributed to those who are deemed 'needy'.</p>
<p>In addition, government also plays a part in influencing&nbsp;the overall level of prices and in attempting to stabilize&nbsp;the economy against fluctuations in income and employment.&nbsp;In this area government intervention is geared&nbsp;towards creating a stable economic environment.</p>
<p>Whilst the above has indicated how the role of government&nbsp;has grown in a mixed economy but the extent to&nbsp;which state should intervene continues to be a contentious&nbsp;issue among economists.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 237</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8727</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Australia and its Northern Territory</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Northern Territory of Australia is a large, sparsely populated area. It relies heavily on tourism, mining,&nbsp;agriculture and fishing.

<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>In 2008-9 the Northern Territory registered a trade surplus of A$ 1454m. On the contrary, Australia&nbsp;recorded a trade deficit of A$ 41665m during the same period. The forecast figures of exports and&nbsp;imports for 2012-13 suggest that the trade surplus of the Northern Territory will rise to A$ 3193m&nbsp;while the trade deficit of Australia will turn into a surplus of A$ 12303m. Thus the trade figures predict&nbsp;an improvement in trade balance of both Northern Territory and Australia.</li>
<li>Over a period of time, the variations in monetary values of exports and imports could result as much&nbsp;from a change in prices as from a change in their volumes. However, measuring their values at constant&nbsp;prices eliminates the changes in monetary figures specifically arising from the changing prices. Therefore&nbsp;a more accurate assessment of variations in the volumes of trade is obtained.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Information on net flow of incomes and changes in reserves would be useful in assessing the international&nbsp;financial position of Australia.<br>The net flow of incomes covers profits, dividends, and interest receipts from abroad minus profits dividends&nbsp;and interest paid abroad. These receipts and payments arise from sales and purchase of assets and&nbsp;bo rrowing and lending of money between countries. The key point is that these incomes are derived from&nbsp;invested capital. Thus if Australia enjoys a positive net flow of income from abroad in its balance of&nbsp;payment then it signifies that Australians possess more international wealth and assets than what the&nbsp;foreigners own in Australia. This, of course, would reflect a strong international financial position. However,&nbsp;a negative net flow of income from abroad would suggest otherwise.<br>Changes in official reserves refer to the reserves of gold and foreign currencies held by the Central Bank&nbsp;for use by the government. A fall in official reserves held by the Australian central bank would reflect a&nbsp;weaker financial position because it then suggests that &nbsp;the reserves have been used by the Australian&nbsp;government either to finance its BOP deficit or else to artificially support the value of its currency in the&nbsp;foreign exchange market. On the other hand rising foreign exchange reserves would suggest a strengthening&nbsp;international financial position.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nominal earning figures are the simple monetary values at the prices ruling at the time. In order to show&nbsp;how much better or worse off an individual or a nation is, nominal earning figures must be corrected for. Thus,<br>Change in real earnings = growth in nominal earnings - inflation rate<br>Growth in nominal earnings = (1050 - 916)/916 &nbsp;× &nbsp;100% =14.6%,<br>Rate of lnflantion = (186.4 -167.7)/167.7 × 100% = 11.2%<br>Thus the price level is expected to rise by 11.2% and a 14.6% growth in nominal earnings will increase&nbsp;the earnings in real terms by 3.4%. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Heavy reliance on tourism suggests that the earnings of the Northern Territory will be more susceptible&nbsp;to changes in the level of incomes of the potential tourists. Generally income elasticity of demand for&nbsp;tourism is considered high, therefore, worldwide economic variations could result in a significant fluctuation&nbsp;in the number of tourists visiting the area and hence the incomes earned from tourism.<br>However the significant growth in extraction of oil, gas and other valuable minerals would benefit the area&nbsp;in terms of employment and earnings, at least in the short run. But these resources are finite and therefore&nbsp;they are subject to depletion and ultimately exhaustion. There is, therefore, a question of economic&nbsp;sustainability in the long run. Also in the energy hungry world the oil and gas reserves, in particular, would&nbsp;be extremely precious in future and selling them today at lower prices means sacrificing a much higher value&nbsp;in future. Moreover, their rapid extraction could generate considerable negative externalities that will eventually&nbsp;undermine the attractiveness of the area as a tourists' destination. It, thus, follows that over-extraction&nbsp;of natural resources could impair the economic prospects of the Northern Territory.<br>Other indicators in the table reflect a better outlook of the Northern Territory than the whole of Australia.&nbsp;For instance, the rate of inflation, although on a higher side, yet it is still lower by 1.8% than that of&nbsp;Australia. Similarly the rise in real earnings over the same period is 3.6%, which is marginally higher than&nbsp;the forecast figure for Australia. Furthermore, a 9.4% growth of working population reflects a positive&nbsp;economic prospect because potentially there will be more human resources available to work in future.&nbsp;However, this would be accompanied with a 2% rise in the rate of unemployment. This, in particular, is&nbsp;detrimental to the economic prospects of the area because it suggests a limited growth in the job market<br>Thus we infer that the economic outlook of Northern Territory seems somewhat better than the whole of&nbsp;Australia. However, issues such as dependence on a narrow range of production, over extraction of natural&nbsp;resources and the increasing rate of unemployment undermine the overall economic prospects of the area.</li>

It is an&nbsp;example of direct government intervention in markets in&nbsp;order to raise money for its functioning and more importantly&nbsp;to influence allocation of resources among&nbsp;competing uses. Examples of indirect taxes include excise&nbsp;duties, VAT and sales tax on various products.&nbsp;The ultimate liability of an indirect tax is on businesses&nbsp;thus, introduction of such a tax increases the costs of&nbsp;a business causing an inward shift in the supply curve.&nbsp;The effect is shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/11f678362015e4f9699cc51ec7daf274" alt="" width="393" height="262"></p>
<p>The curve S is before tax and S + t is the supply after&nbsp;tax. The vertical distance e<sub>1</sub>-m between the pre-tax and&nbsp;the post-tax supply curve measures the tax per unit.&nbsp;Price rises from P to P<sub>1</sub> and quantity sold decreases&nbsp;from q to q<sub>1</sub>. The rise in price from p to p<sub>1</sub> is the&nbsp;amount of tax passed on to consumers and thus represents&nbsp;the consumer's share of the tax. Since increase in&nbsp;price from P to P<sub>1</sub> is less than the tax per unit measured&nbsp;on vertical axis P<sub>1</sub>- t, therefore the remainder is the&nbsp;producers' share. The firms will of course try to pass&nbsp;on to the consumers as much of the tax as possible by&nbsp;raising the price of the good. However their ability to&nbsp;raise price by the full amount of the tax is limited by&nbsp;elasticity of demand and supply. Only in case of perfectly&nbsp;elastic demand or perfectly inelastic supply will&nbsp;the consumer not be made worse off as firms are unable&nbsp;to pass on tax to the consumers. But that is not the case&nbsp;of making consumers better off.</p>
<p>So far our analysis suggests that an indirect tax shifts&nbsp;the supply curve to the left therefore it raises price. As&nbsp;a consequence consumers pay a higher price and consume&nbsp;less. This reduces consumer surplus measured by&nbsp;the area PP<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>and e in the graph above. Clearly this&nbsp;does not benefit consumers although the way government&nbsp;spends the money collected by tax may benefit&nbsp;them in some other form. For instance consumers may&nbsp;benefit if the money is used to improve infrastructure&nbsp;or health care facilities. Also a tax on demerit goods that&nbsp;reduces their consumption may raise consumers' welfare&nbsp;without any acknowledgment by them.</p>
<p>Maximum price is the maximum legal price that a seller&nbsp;is allowed to charge for a product. The price is not&nbsp;allowed to rise above this level but it is permitted to fall&nbsp;below it. Government uses price ceiling in circumstances&nbsp;when equilibrium price set by the market forces for&nbsp;some essential product is unfairly high and it may not&nbsp;be affordable for less privileged.</p>
<p>If the maximum price is set above the equilibrium price,&nbsp;it has no effect since the equilibrium remains attainable.&nbsp;It is effective when set below the equilibrium price. The&nbsp;graph below illustrates the effects of an effective maximum&nbsp;price.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8d94f95432a1602a3ee1ebc083de8904" alt="" width="371" height="249"></p>
<p>Here Pe and qe are the equilibrium price and quantity&nbsp;that would prevail without government regulation. The&nbsp;government, however, has decided that Pe is too high&nbsp;and has mandated that the price can be no higher than&nbsp;a maximum price, denoted by P<sub>max</sub>· &nbsp;At this lower price,&nbsp;producers will produce less, and supply will be q<sub>1.&nbsp;</sub>Consumers, on the other hand, will demand q<sub>2</sub>. So&nbsp;demand exceeds supply, and a shortage q<sub>2</sub> - q<sub>1</sub> develops.&nbsp;As a result some people gain and some lose from price&nbsp;controls. Consumers who can purchase the product at&nbsp;a lower price are clearly better off, as surplus for them&nbsp;increases measured by rectangle A. But those who have&nbsp;been rationed out and cannot buy the good are worse&nbsp;off because they lose the surplus measured by triangle&nbsp;B. Over all gain to consumers is the difference between&nbsp;rectangle A and triangle B.</p>
<p>Another major consequence of maximum price, with or&nbsp;without rationing, is the emergence of black markets.&nbsp;This is a market in which goods are sold illegally at&nbsp;whatever price equates illegal demand and supply. Black&nbsp;marketers would buy q<sub>2</sub> at the controlled price of Pmax&nbsp;paying the amount measured by rectangle E. They would&nbsp;sell at the price Pb, earning profits shown by the gray&nbsp;area between Pb and Pmax. The existence of such a&nbsp;market results in all consumers becoming definitely worse&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>Finally we conclude that overall effect of indirect tax&nbsp;depends on elasticities of demand and supply whereas&nbsp;the effect of maximum price depends on whether the&nbsp;price fixed is below or above the market equilibrium&nbsp;price. So far as the consumer benefit is concerned&nbsp;maximum price can potentially result in an increase in&nbsp;consumer surplus but indirect tax in no case increases&nbsp;consumer surplus.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 239</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8725</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Using a normal demand curve, explain how consumer&nbsp;surplus occurs.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A normal demand curve slopes downward from left to&nbsp;right and thus reflects an inverse relationship between&nbsp;price and quantity demanded of a product. Whilst consumer&nbsp;surplus is the difference between what a consumer&nbsp;is willing to pay for a good and what he actually&nbsp;pays for it. lt arises due to the downward sloping nature&nbsp;of demand curve and for the fact that price paid is equal&nbsp;to the last worthwhile unit purchased. Hence consumer&nbsp;surplus is measured by the area above the price charged&nbsp;and below the demand curve.</p>
<p>To see the relationship between a normal downward&nbsp;sloping demand curve and consumer surplus, let's examine&nbsp;the following graph for chocolate.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f7d06c96a2a980424694e91ffd3cdd4a" alt="" width="430" height="367"></p>
<p>The market price, determined by demand and supply&nbsp;forces, is $12 per unit. Hence, the first unit of chocolate&nbsp;costs $12 but is worth $20. This $20 valuation is&nbsp;obtained by using the demand curve to find the maximum&nbsp;amount that the consumer will pay for each additional&nbsp;unit. The unit is worth purchasing because it&nbsp;generates $8 of surplus value above and beyond the cost&nbsp;of the purchase. The second unit is also worth buying&nbsp;because it generates a surplus of $6 ($18 - $12). The&nbsp;third unit generates a surplus of $4, the fourth yields&nbsp;only $2. The consumer is indifferent about purchasing&nbsp;the fifth unit because the market price matches the&nbsp;buyer's valuation hence it generates zero surplus. But&nbsp;consumer prefers not to buy any more as the consumer's&nbsp;valuation of sixth unit is less than the market price.&nbsp;Thus, consumer surplus is obtained by adding the excess&nbsp;values or surpluses for all units purchased. In this&nbsp;case, consumer surplus = $8 + $6 + $4 + $2 + $0 = $20. A change in market price as a result of shift in the&nbsp;market supply curve will directly affect the level of&nbsp;consumer surplus as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/d3f595579da69d193915e78e001e6603" alt="" width="315" height="219"></p>
<p>The graph shows market demand and supply curves, D<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;and S<sub>1</sub> and an initial equilibrium market price at P<sub>1</sub>. The&nbsp;triangle AP<sub>1</sub>C, which lies below the market demand curve&nbsp;but above the price of P<sub>1</sub>, shows consumer surplus gained&nbsp;in the market as a whole. If the supply curve now shifts&nbsp;leftward to S<sub>2</sub>, causing the market price to rise to P<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;the consumer surplus triangle becomes smaller, falling to&nbsp;the area ABP<sub>2</sub>. The resulting fall in consumer surplus&nbsp;is shown by the area P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>BC.</p>
<p>Apart from changes in price consumer surplus will be affected&nbsp;by elasticity of demand as shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/2857a1117e94e29428dd08197a6011c5" alt="" width="290" height="233"></p>
<p>The demand curve D<sub>1</sub> is less elastic than D<sub>2</sub> at price OP,&nbsp;thus yielding PAe amount of consumer surplus which&nbsp;is higher than the level of consumer surplus PBe on D<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;at the same price.</p>
<p>Thus, we conclude that the higher the PED the lower&nbsp;the level of consumer surplus and vice versa. In extreme&nbsp;cases when PED= 0, consumer surplus is immeasurable&nbsp;and when demand is perfectly inelastic consumer surplus&nbsp;is zero.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 240</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8724</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss how well comparative advantage explains the&nbsp;pattern of international trade.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>When a country has an absolute advantage over others&nbsp;in a product, the gains from trade are obvious. But what&nbsp;if one country can produce all commodities more efficiently&nbsp;than other countries? The answer underlies the&nbsp;theory of comparative advantage and is still accepted by&nbsp;economists today as a valid statement of the potential&nbsp;gains from trade.</p>
<p>The theory of comparative advantage suggests that gains&nbsp;from trade arise mainly because different nations have&nbsp;different opportunity costs. For a nation, the opportunity&nbsp;cost is the amount of other products, which must&nbsp;be sacrificed in order to produce a unit of another product.&nbsp;This would also reflect its factor endowment.</p>
<p>Thus a country is said to have comparative advantage&nbsp;when it can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost&nbsp;than another country. The result is increased total output&nbsp;when countries trade with one another at an exchange&nbsp;rate between their opportunity cost ratios. An&nbsp;example will help to make the point.<br>Let's assume that there are only two countries involved&nbsp;in trade, say, Pakistan and Iran. When negative production externalities exist, social costs&nbsp;exceed private cost. This leads to the private optimum&nbsp;level of output being greater than the social optimum&nbsp;level of production because the individual producer does&nbsp;not take the effects of negative externalities into their&nbsp;calculations.</p>
<p>The diagram below provides a way of illustrating the&nbsp;output of a product larger than socially desirable.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e8b9bebbb23a75bccb640d588c1e9947" alt="" width="522" height="328"></p>
<p>In the absence of externalities, the private costs of the&nbsp;supplier are the same as the costs for society. But if&nbsp;there are negative externalities, we must add the external&nbsp;costs to the firm's supply curve to find the social cost&nbsp;curve as given in the diagram above.</p>
<p>A socially efficient level of output would be Q<sub>2</sub>, where&nbsp;MSB = MSC, with a higher price P<sub>2</sub>. At this price level,&nbsp;the external costs have been taken into account. Since&nbsp;the market fails to include these external costs, therefore&nbsp;the equilibrium output will be Q<sub>1</sub> and the price P<sub>1</sub>. Hence&nbsp;good with negative externality will be over-produced i.e.&nbsp;produced in a quantity higher than is socially desirable.</p>
<p>Demerit goods, on the other hand, are worse for the&nbsp;individual consumers than the individual realize. A demerit&nbsp;good is also associated with negative externalities.&nbsp;However the reason for identifying these products differently&nbsp;is to do with the failure of information to the&nbsp;consumers. Consumers do not perceive how bad a&nbsp;particular product is for them. Either they do not have&nbsp;the right information or they simply lack some relevant&nbsp;information. The result is higher demand and over-production&nbsp;of these goods. Figure below illustrates the&nbsp;problem:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/ced4bd78bf1b0da4488dcb9dcb9b4b61" alt="" width="284" height="251"></p>
<p>Here the correct demand should be at D<sub>2</sub>, which will lead&nbsp;the socially desirable level of output of q<sub>2</sub> at a price of&nbsp;P<sub>2 .</sub>Since consumers over-value the product, therefore&nbsp;demand is registered at the higher level of D<sub>1</sub>. This leads&nbsp;to a market price P<sub>1</sub> and a production q<sub>1</sub>, which is higher&nbsp;than the socially desirable level of output q<sub>1</sub>.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 241</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8723</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how a country's production possibility curve depends upon its factors of production.

entrepreneur.&nbsp;These are all the inputs used in production of&nbsp;those goods and services that we want.</p>
<p>Broadly, land includes all natural resources usable in the&nbsp;production process such as arable land, forests, coal, oil.&nbsp;Labour consists of all the physical ＆ mental talents of&nbsp;individuals available and usable in producing goods ＆ services. Capital, a man made resource, comprises of all&nbsp;manufactured resources usable in production e.g. machinery,&nbsp;tools, equipment. Last but not least, the entrepreneur,&nbsp;who takes the initiative and combines the resources&nbsp;of land, capital, and labor to produce a good or service.&nbsp;A production possibility curve (PPC) shows all possible&nbsp;combinations of two goods that a country can&nbsp;produce within a specified time period with all its resources&nbsp;fully and efficiently employed. The idea of&nbsp;production possibilities is usually shown graphically as&nbsp;given below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/21cd9b5e1458d41bc8dfeb3df9fb187c" alt="" width="332" height="278"></p>
<p>Each point on the PPC represents maximum output of&nbsp;capital goods and consumer goods. The country must&nbsp;achieve full employment and productive efficiency in&nbsp;order to operate at any point on the PPC. However, if&nbsp;the economy were at point G, there would be unemployed&nbsp;resources and by bringing those resources into&nbsp;use the economy could move to any point on the PPC.&nbsp;Points outside the frontier such as H are unattainable&nbsp;with the current supplies of resources and technology.&nbsp;The negative slope of the PPC can be viewed in terms&nbsp;of opportunity cost, which shows that obtaining more&nbsp;of one type of output requires having less of the other.&nbsp;A PPC is drawn on the assumptions that the quantity&nbsp;and quality of resources are fixed and the economy is&nbsp;employing all of them to produce goods and services at&nbsp;least cost. Although, economies can gain or lose resources&nbsp;over a period of time. Such changes will shift the production&nbsp;possibility curve to a new position. Figures below&nbsp;illustrate the outcome of changes in the quantity and&nbsp;quality of resources.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6d9b4069795d450334b6f6e1b1aa3b6f" alt="" width="429" height="177"></p>
<p>Figure 1 shows expanded production possibilities known&nbsp;as potential growth. This could be due to an increase in&nbsp;the quantity and/or improvement in the productivity of&nbsp;resources. Common sense tells us that. Over time a&nbsp;nation's growing population will bring about increases&nbsp;in the supplies of labour and entrepreneurial ability. Also,&nbsp;labour productivity usually improves over time. Moreover, increase in stock of capital and discovery of new&nbsp;resources both result in an increase in productive potential.&nbsp;The net result is the ability to produce more of&nbsp;both capital and consumer goods.<br>Figure 2 shows a decline in productive potential of an&nbsp;economy. This is the outcome of a decrease in working&nbsp;population or else some of the economy's resources have&nbsp;become exhausted.</p>
<p>Thus a country's production possibility curve largely&nbsp;depends on the amount and quality of factors of production&nbsp;available. Countries blessed with greater quantities&nbsp;and better quality of factors will have higher PPC&nbsp;than countries with less quantities and poor quality of&nbsp;factors of production.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 242</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8722</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Inflation in Paraguay</strong></p>

<li>Weights are expressed as the amount spent on each item as a fraction of total&nbsp;expenditure. They reflect relative importance of different items to consumers and&nbsp;thus make CPI a more accurate measure of inflation.</li>
<li>A fall in weight for alcohol and tobacco from 2.1 in 1992 to 1.2 in 2008 may&nbsp;have resulted from a decrease in consumption possibly due to a rise in their&nbsp;prices or a combination of an effective awareness campaign and more strict laws&nbsp;against their use.<br>On the contrary an increase in weight assigned to transport from 7.4 in 1992&nbsp;to 14.8 in 2008 indicates an increase in the amount spent as a fraction of total&nbsp;expenditure. This may have resulted from increases in incomes of the people&nbsp;encouraging them to spend more on traveling or possibly due to the rising transport&nbsp;cost necessitating more to be spent on commuting.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>A persistent increase in general price level leading to a fall in the value of money.</li>
<li>Until 1987, the rate of inflation in Paraguay mostly remained higher than the&nbsp;rate of inflation registered in Venezuela for the same period However, from 1987&nbsp;onward the rate inflation in Paraguay remained lower than that of Venezuela.</li>
<li>The first decade registered relatively high and unstable rate of inflation. It is&nbsp;only during the second decade and particularly in eight years from 1962-1970&nbsp;that the government of Paraguay seems most successful in maintaining a low andstable rate of inflation. From 1970 onward inflation rate frequently fluctuated&nbsp;approximately between 5 to 40% which by no means can be labeled as low and&nbsp;stable rate of inflation. Overall the rate of inflation remained unstable and relatively&nbsp;higher for the period of fitly five years.</li>
<li>Relatively high rate of inflation can bring an unfair and undesirable redistribution of&nbsp;income and wealth. For instance, people on fixed incomes and those in a. weak&nbsp;bargaining position become poorer whereas those who can use their economic power&nbsp;to gain large pay rent or profit gain. There is also a redistribution of income from&nbsp;borrowers to lenders which discourages savings.<br>Moreover high rate of inflation tends to cause uncertainty among the business community,&nbsp;especially when the rate of inflation fluctuates. If it is difficult for firms to&nbsp;predict their costs and revenues, they may be discouraged from investing. This will&nbsp;reduce the rate of economic growth.<br>Also inflation is likely to worsen the balance of payments. If a country suffers from&nbsp;relatively high inflation, its exports will become less competitive in the world market.&nbsp;At the same time, imports will become relatively cheaper than home-produced goods.&nbsp;Thus exports will fall and imports will rise. As a result the balance of payments will&nbsp;deteriorate and the exchange rate will fall.<br>Around 3% annual rate of inflation should be considered desirable for a number of&nbsp;reasons. Firstly, such a low and stable rate of inflation will avoid undesirable income&nbsp;distortions caused by high rate of inflation. Secondly, low and stable rate of inflation&nbsp;may stimulate business persons to invest because they may regard it as a sign of&nbsp;an expanding economy and rising demand. Also the competitiveness of the country's&nbsp;products improves in the world market, which is likely to improve balance of payment&nbsp;and hence the country's exchange rate.<br>While low and stable rate of inflation can be an important policy target of all governments&nbsp;but the ability to achieve this depends on their administrative control and&nbsp;current economic circumstances.</li>

Conversely free goods, air and sunlight&nbsp;for instance, are plentiful in their availability, therefore&nbsp;nothing has to be sacrificed in order to obtain them.<br>Secondly the two products in question, depending on&nbsp;who holds them, can be viewed similar as either capital&nbsp;or consumer goods. Goods which directly satisfy consumer&nbsp;wants and are in the hands of consumer are&nbsp;labeled as consumer goods whereas stocks of consumer&nbsp;goods not yet in the hands of consumer are considered&nbsp;part of capital goods. In this case stocks of both cigarettes&nbsp;and vaccine held by the sellers would be considered&nbsp;as capital goods or else. Both these products in the&nbsp;hands of consumers are classified together as consumer&nbsp;goods.<br>Thirdly the two products in question are subject to the&nbsp;principles of exclusion and rivalry therefore can be classified&nbsp;together as private goods. The principle of exclusion&nbsp;states that all those who are unable or unwilling to&nbsp;pay for these goods can be excluded from the products&nbsp;benefits while rivalry means one person's consumption&nbsp;of a packet of cigarettes or a vaccination against influenza&nbsp;reduces the amount left for others to consume and&nbsp;benefit from - because scarce resources are used up in&nbsp;producing and supplying them. On the contrary public&nbsp;goods such as street lights are non excludable and non rivalrous.&nbsp;The term non excludability suggests that there&nbsp;is no effective way of excluding individuals from their&nbsp;benefits once those goods come into existence. Nonrivalry&nbsp;means when more people consume the product,&nbsp;the benefit to those already consuming the product is&nbsp;not diminished. Public goods, therefore, involve free rider&nbsp;problem, that is, we all want to be free riders when we&nbsp;believe that someone else will pay and then they will&nbsp;be available to all. Hence public goods cannot be supplied&nbsp;through markets as there is no effective demand&nbsp;registered in the market.<br>However, an economist would not classify the two&nbsp;products in question as similar when he categorizes&nbsp;private goods into merit and demerit goods. In this&nbsp;context a packet of cigarettes is viewed as a&nbsp;demerit good and a vaccination against influenza is viewed as a&nbsp;merit good.<br>A merit good is better for the consumer than the consumer&nbsp;perceives and a demerit good is worse for the&nbsp;consumer than the consumer realizes. In addition to this&nbsp;a merit good is associated with positive externalities&nbsp;whereas a demerit good is seen as a product that has&nbsp;negative externalities associated with it. Thus the&nbsp;essence of merit and demerit goods is to do with a failure&nbsp;of information to the consumer and spillover effects on&nbsp;non-consumers. In case of vaccination against influenza&nbsp;quite often people do not appreciate how good inoculation&nbsp;is for them. They do not perceive its full benefits&nbsp;at the time of making decision therefore results in insufficient&nbsp;demand being registered for the product in the&nbsp;market and may be under-consumed because people&nbsp;undervalue the product as shown in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4cdcdf1f66fa145f8108f512d751d458" alt="" width="447" height="256"><br><br>Curve D<sub>1</sub> indicates the level of demand when consumers&nbsp;have all relevant information tor decision making. However&nbsp;the demand for influenza vaccine registered in the&nbsp;market is shown by the curve D because consumers&nbsp;may not feel the need to purchase due to the lack of&nbsp;information. Thus the market forces would provide oq&nbsp;amount only whereas oq1 is the socially optimum quantity.&nbsp;Also an inoculation might be seen as a merit good&nbsp;as others who may not catch the disease from the&nbsp;inoculated person also benefit.<br>On the other hand people do not fully realize how bad&nbsp;the consumption of cigarettes is therefore consumers&nbsp;overvalue them and demand registered for them is higher&nbsp;than the socially optimum level. Furthermore, cigarettes&nbsp;can be seen as a demerit good because it inflicts external&nbsp;costs in terms of secondary smoking that can be viewed&nbsp;as possible cause of ill health for others as shown in the&nbsp;graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a49e65aa7c4b98bf2a1adf2eb71afcc2" alt="" width="512" height="297"><br><br>The social optimal level of consumption would be q<sub>1</sub> -&nbsp;an output that takes into account the information failure&nbsp;of consumers and also negative externalities. The market&nbsp;fails to take into account the negative externalities of&nbsp;consumption because the social cost &gt; private cost.&nbsp;Consumers too may experience imperfect information&nbsp;about the long term costs to themselves of consuming&nbsp;the products deemed to be demerit goods.<br>In the end it can be concluded that an economist would&nbsp;classify both the products in question together as private&nbsp;goods, however, he would view a packet of cigarettes&nbsp;as a demerit good and a vaccination against influenza&nbsp;as a merit good on the basis of the decisions made&nbsp;by individuals regarding how much to consume each of&nbsp;the two products and the implication of their decisions&nbsp;on allocation of scarce resources.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 244</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8657</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The importance of copper production in Chile</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chile is a major producer and exporter of copper. For Chile, copper is a vital export and makes a major&nbsp;contribution to its trade. The Central Bank of Chile forecast a visible trade surplus of US$17 billion for 2006,&nbsp;two thirds higher than in 2005. Changes in world copper prices in 2006, a year of global growth, were an&nbsp;important influence on Chile's trade performance. However, one problem that Chile faced in 2006 was a strike&nbsp;for higher wages and better conditions at Escondida, the world's largest copper mine. where 8 % of world&nbsp;copper was mined.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Figure 1 shows the contribution of copper to Chile's export revenue and changes in world copper prices.</p>

<li>In the middle of 2006 the price of copper was higher by approximately $6000 per tonne than its price in june&nbsp;2003. Hence increase in copper price is fourfold or about 300%.</li>
<li>High global economic growth might have resulted in a greater production of goods that incorporated copper which&nbsp;might have led to a higher demand for copper and consequently fourfold increase in its price. Also new uses of&nbsp;copper or relatively higher prices of other metals, to which copper is considered a close substitute, might have&nbsp;led to an increase in demand and then a rise in price. On the other side a fall in supply might have also contributed&nbsp;to increase in price. Supply might have fallen due to higher production costs associated with the industrial action,&nbsp;or else it might have been the result of a policy of copper producing countries to conserve their reserves of&nbsp;important minerals. The effect of changes in demand and supply on price of copper is shown in the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/fdd8e4b3b06ff98d5cf9610fe3c2a92a" alt="" width="504" height="246"><br><br>Rise in demand is shown by a rightward shift in demand curve from D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>2</sub> and fall in supply by a leftward&nbsp;shift in supply curve from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub> resulting in an increase in price from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>.</li>

<li>Chile had an approximately $10 billion trade surplus in the year 2005.</li>
<li>The current account on balance of payments records four major types of transactions: the exchange of visible&nbsp;or merchandise goods, the exchange of invisibles or services, flow of incomes, and finally current transfers. Chile's&nbsp;current account balance can be calculated by adding balance on visible and invisibles to net foreign incomes and&nbsp;net current transfers. Hence, in addition to the sum of visible exports, the sum of visible imports is required&nbsp;in order to calculate first the visible balance and then balance on invisibles, net flow of incomes and finally net current transfers are required to calculate Chile's current account balance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Although earnings from copper exports between 2002 and 2005 increased in absolute terms but it is implausible to indicate relative importance of copper export. Rather an approximately 20% increase in the proportion of earnings from copper exports to total exports earnings truly indicates that copper is becoming an increasingly important export item for Chile.</li>
<li>International specialisation means that nations concentrate on producing what they can do best rather than relying&nbsp;on self sufficiency. Specialisation results in nations producing surplus beyond their needs. Surplus products can&nbsp;then be exchanged and traded with the potential for gains in welfare for all parties.<br>According to economic theory differences in factor endowment and hence relative costs of producing goods provide the basis of specialization and trade. Theory of comparative advantage states that countries should specialise in the production of a good in which they have a comparative advantage and then trade, causing global output to increase. Comparative advantage is the ability of a nation to produce a product at a lower opportunity cost than another country.<br>For a particular country gain from specialization comes in a variety of ways. Specialisation in a single product allows the nation to produce a higher output and exploit scale economies by operating in larger markets. A higher output at lower per unit costs means more wants and needs might be satisfied with a given amount of scarce&nbsp;resources, hence resulting in improvement in allocative efficiency and significant increases in welfare. Also specialisation and trade, in ideas at least stimulates product and process innovations that generates better products for consumers and enhances the overall standard of living.<br>On the contrary specialization in a single product can prove to be risky and is prone to potential threats. A highly specialized economy such as Zambia with copper and Cuba with sugar will be highly susceptible to world&nbsp;market fluctuations. For instance, a decline in price of the product in international market, say due to a fall in demand world over, may lead to significant decline in export earnings and mass unemployment hence generating economic crisis. The situation can be even worse when the country is highly dependant on other nations for important food items or strategically important products. Also depletion of natural resources can result in lower&nbsp;output and less export earnings hampering country's ability to import products that the country is relying on other nations. For domestic workers the choice of skills is limited resulting in restricted job opportunities. In conclusion specialistion brings plenty of benefits for a nation however in particular situations the nation is vulnerable to changes in international conditions.</li>

<ol>
<li>Visible part of current account records trade in goods&nbsp;only. For instance, import and export of raw materials,&nbsp;semi-manufactured products and manufactured&nbsp;goods. Visible exports are goods sold to foreigners&nbsp;and thus, recorded with a positive sign on&nbsp;the visible part of the current account since they&nbsp;result in an inflow of money. Visible imports are&nbsp;goods bought by domestic residents from foreigners&nbsp;and are recorded with a minus sign as they cause&nbsp;an outflow of money. The difference between visible&nbsp;exports and visible imports is termed as visible&nbsp;balance or balance of trade.</li>
<li>Invisible part of current account records trade in&nbsp;services. A wide variety of services is traded internationally,&nbsp;including financial services such as banking&nbsp;and insurance, transport services such as shipping&nbsp;and air travel, and tourism. The easiest way&nbsp;to distinguish between invisible exports and imports&nbsp;is to consider flows of money rather than flows of&nbsp;services. For example, foreign residents taking holidays&nbsp;in Pakistan results in an inflow of money&nbsp;likewise, Pakistani residents taking holidays abroad&nbsp;leads to an outflow of money from Pakistan.</li>
<li>This part of current account covers profits, dividends,&nbsp;and interest receipts from abroad minus&nbsp;profits dividends and interest paid abroad. These&nbsp;receipts and payments arise from sales and purchase&nbsp;of assets and borrowing and lending of money&nbsp;between countries.</li>
<li>Current transfers include central government and&nbsp;private transfers. Central government transfers&nbsp;consist of net contribution to the international&nbsp;organization, bilateral aid and military grants to and&nbsp;from the country. Receipts from private transfers&nbsp;include items such as money sent back to families&nbsp;by Pakistani citizens working abroad and taxes on&nbsp;incomes paid by foreign workers to Pakistani tax&nbsp;authorities. Transfer payments include money sent&nbsp;home by foreign workers in Pakistan and taxes paid&nbsp;by Pakistani nationals to foreign governments.<br>The current balance is the difference between total&nbsp;receipts (inflow) and total payments (outflow). It&nbsp;can also be calculated by adding balance on visibles&nbsp;and invisibles to net foreign incomes and net current&nbsp;transfers. The current account is, therefore,&nbsp;likely to show a difference between earnings and&nbsp;expenditure. When the total outflows exceed total&nbsp;inflows, we say that there is a current account deficit;&nbsp;when the reverse occurs, we say that there is&nbsp;a current account surplus.</li>

<p>In order to determine the, size of labour force we exclude,&nbsp;from the total population, children under 16 years&nbsp;of age and people who are institutionalized, for instance,&nbsp;mentally retarded and prisoners. We also subtract the&nbsp;number of adults who are potential workers but are not&nbsp;seeking work for some reason such as homemakers, full&nbsp;time students and retired.</p>
<p>The size of a country's labour force is determined by&nbsp;changes in demographic, economic, social and cultural&nbsp;factors.</p>
<p>In general, certain demographic trends influence the size&nbsp;of labour force in an economy. For instance, if in a country&nbsp;birth rate exceeds death rate or the number of immigration&nbsp;is larger than emigration, the total population and&nbsp;hence the labour force is expected to increase. On the&nbsp;other hand, a decrease in the size of population due to&nbsp;either negative growth rate of population or a trend of&nbsp;migration to other parts of the world tend to reduce the size of labour force.<br>Changes in the age composition of population also influence&nbsp;the size of working population. For instance, a&nbsp;rising proportion of aging population out of the total&nbsp;population reduces labour force whereas increasing proportion&nbsp;of working age group is expected to increase the&nbsp;number of eligible workers who are willing to work.</p>
<p>The available labour force will also be affected by any&nbsp;statutory changes in the school leaving age and the&nbsp;retirement age. For instance, an increase in school leaving&nbsp;age from 16 to 17 years will have the effect of&nbsp;reducing the size of working population, as would a&nbsp;decrease in the age of retirement from 65 to 60 years.&nbsp;Similarly, a decrease in school leaving age or an increase&nbsp;in the retirement age would increase the size of labour&nbsp;force.</p>
<p>Recently, in many developed countries growth in labour&nbsp;force has slowed down and in some it has become&nbsp;negative mainly due to people opting for early retirements&nbsp;and also due to increase in the number of school&nbsp;leavers remaining in higher education. On the contrary,&nbsp;in some low-income countries such as India, a growing&nbsp;desire among families to achieve higher standard of&nbsp;living has led to an increase in the number of individuals,&nbsp;in each family, willing to work.</p>
<p>In many far Eastern countries such as Malaysia and&nbsp;Indonesia the growing participation rate of female workers&nbsp;has led to an increase in labour force. This can be&nbsp;viewed as a result of positive change in society's attitude&nbsp;towards women at work, decline in birth rate and lower&nbsp;family size, higher educational attainment by women,&nbsp;greater use of labour saving home appliances and most&nbsp;importantly an increase in the opportunities of part time&nbsp;work or flexible timings.</p>
<p>Finally, a rise in the demand for labour and an accompanying&nbsp;increase in earnings will result in an increase in&nbsp;the proportion of the population willing to work. For&nbsp;instance, more married women and elderly people enter&nbsp;the labour force when the demand for labour is high.&nbsp;Similarly, the labour force tends to decrease when earnings&nbsp;and employment opportunities decline.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 247</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8624</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>Inflation is defined as a persistent and generalized&nbsp;increase in the level of prices. The term persistent&nbsp;implies that average of all prices is rising year in and&nbsp;year out.<br>Inflation is measured by changes in the retail price index&nbsp;(RPI) which records changes in the general level of prices&nbsp;paid by consumers for all the goods and services they&nbsp;buy.<br>An index number is a means whereby changes in a large&nbsp;number of related variables can be averaged, and the&nbsp;average change expressed through movements in a single&nbsp;number. Its calculation is a major statistical task, involving&nbsp;three main stages illustrated below.<br>Firstly, a survey is conducted to find out what families&nbsp;buy and how much they spend on particular items. The&nbsp;findings from the survey help economists to select items&nbsp;and to assign relative weights to individual commodities&nbsp;according to the percentage of income spent on each&nbsp;commodity by an average household. To construct an&nbsp;example let's assume that the selected items are fuel,&nbsp;milk and meat and households spend their income in the&nbsp;ratio 2:3:4 respectively on these commodities.<br>Then comes the second stage of recording how much the&nbsp;prices of selected items have changed, the information&nbsp;is collected from all main retail outlet and from utility&nbsp;providers such as gas, water and transport etc. For&nbsp;example, if the prices of selected items in our example&nbsp;change as that of milk per litre from Rs. 30 to Rs. 28,&nbsp;of fuel from Rs. 55 to Rs. 70 and that of 1 Kg. meat&nbsp;from Rs. 100 to Rs. 110.<br>Once the prices have been recorded, at the third and last&nbsp;stage the percentage change in price for each item is then&nbsp;multiplied by its weights. From this the average change&nbsp;in the RPI is determined, as illustrated below:<br><br>

<br>The price index for each category shows what has&nbsp;happened to the price level since a base year value. To&nbsp;generate a weighted price index we multiply the price&nbsp;index for each category by its weight and then sum these.&nbsp;We then divide this by the sum of the weights (9) to&nbsp;find an overall price index (108.3).<br>If the index is calculated to be over 100 in year 1, then&nbsp;on average price level has increased compared with the&nbsp;base year (year 0) index = 100. In our example index in&nbsp;year 1 is 108.3, then price level has risen by 8.3% since&nbsp;the base year. An index of below 100 in year 1 would&nbsp;indicate a fall in average price level.</li>
<li>Rapid rate of inflation is considered an evil phenomenon&nbsp;by eonomists all over the world because it brings with&nbsp;it economic imbalance and a number of distortions.<br>We must first be clear about the difference between&nbsp;money (or nominal) income and real income. Nominal&nbsp;income is the number of Rs. received as wages, rent,&nbsp;interest, or profits. Real income measures the amount of&nbsp;goods and services nominal income can buy.<br>If an individual's nominal income increases faster than&nbsp;the price level, his real income will rise. If the price level&nbsp;increases faster than his nominal income, his real income&nbsp;will decline. We can determine approximately how real&nbsp;income changes with this formula:<br>% changes in real income = % change in nominal income&nbsp;- % change in price level<br>A person's real income drops only when his nominal&nbsp;income fails to keep pace with inflation.<br>The redistribution effects of inflation depend on whether&nbsp;or not it is expected. With fully expected or anticipated&nbsp;inflation, an income receiver may be able to avoid or&nbsp;lessen the adverse effects inflation would otherwise have&nbsp;on real income. But an unanticipated rapid inflation may&nbsp;bring following serious income distortions.<br>Inflation redistributes real income away from fixed-income&nbsp;receivers towards others in the economy. The&nbsp;classic case is the elderly couple living on pension or&nbsp;annuity providing a fixed amount of nominal income&nbsp;each month. They may have retired in, say, 1998 on&nbsp;what appeared to be an adequate pension. However, by&nbsp;2008 they will discover that the purchasing power of&nbsp;that pension has been cut by one-half.<br>Similarly, landlords who receive lease payments of fixed&nbsp;amounts will be hurt by inflation as they receive Rs. of&nbsp;declining value over time. To a lesser extent some whitecollar&nbsp;workers, for example,some public sector&nbsp;employees whose incomes are dictated by fixed pay&nbsp;scales, and families living on fixed levels of welfare will&nbsp;also be victims of inflation.<br>Some people living on flexible incomes may benefit. For&nbsp;example, workers in expanding industries who are represented&nbsp;by strong unions may keep their nominal wages&nbsp;apace with rate of inflation. Whereas those in declining&nbsp;industries or without strong unions may find that the&nbsp;price level jumps ahead of their money incomes. Business&nbsp;executives and other profit receivers may benefit&nbsp;if product prices rise faster than resource prices as&nbsp;business receipts will grow at a faster rate than inflation.<br>Inflation hurts savers. As prices rise, the real value, or&nbsp;the purchasing power of a nest egg of savings deteriorates.&nbsp;The simplest case is the individual who hoards&nbsp;money as a cash balance. A Rs. 100,000 cash balance&nbsp;would have lost half its real value between 1995 and&nbsp;2005. Of course, most forms of savings earn interest.&nbsp;But the value of savings will still decline if the rate of&nbsp;inflation exceeds the rate of interest.<br>Unanticipated rapid inflation benefits debtors (borrowers)&nbsp;at the expense of creditors (lenders). Suppose you&nbsp;borrow Rs. 10,000 from a bank, to be repaid in 2 years.&nbsp;If in that time the general level of prices doubles, the Rs. 10,000 which you repay will have only half the&nbsp;purchasing power of the amount originally borrowed.&nbsp;The inflation of the past several decades has been a&nbsp;windfall to those who purchased homes in earlier periods&nbsp;with low, fixed-interest-rate mortgages. Inflation has&nbsp;greatly reduced the real burden of their mortgage indebtedness.&nbsp;They have also benefited because the nominal&nbsp;value of housing has increased more rapidly then the&nbsp;overall price level.<br>Nominal national income and therefore tax collections&nbsp;rise with inflation; the amount of public debt owed does&nbsp;not. Thus, inflation reduces the real burden of the public&nbsp;debt to the government. In fact, some nations such as&nbsp;Brazil once used inflation so extensively to reduce the&nbsp;real value of their debt.<br>Finally exporters may lose as their money incomes may&nbsp;fall due to less exports but importers may find their&nbsp;money incomes rising faster than inflation due to rising&nbsp;level of imports.</li>

are&nbsp;allocated to satisfy infinite human wants. Free market&nbsp;economy and planned economy are two such systems.</p>
<p>A free market is typically characterized by limited&nbsp;involvement of government in the economy coupled with&nbsp;individual ownership of the means of production.&nbsp;Individuals can pursue their own self-interest without&nbsp;many constraints. Free market is thus one where&nbsp;decisions are decenteralised and resource allocation takes&nbsp;place through price system, also known as invisible hand.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in a command economy government&nbsp;controls the factors of production and makes all key&nbsp;decisions about their use and about the distribution of&nbsp;income. Thus decision making is a centralized process.&nbsp;The complete opposite of the pure self-interest of the&nbsp;free market system, consumers, workers and the&nbsp;government are all assumed to be working for the&nbsp;'common good'. There is no competition, so there is no&nbsp;price mechanism. The authorities set the prices. As the&nbsp;government runs the system, they have the job of&nbsp;planning how all the available resources should be used.</p>
<p>It makes sense that free market economies allocate&nbsp;resources more efficiently. Decisions about what to&nbsp;produce are made by the people who will actually&nbsp;consume the goods. Firms will produce whatever&nbsp;consumers are prepared to buy since, due to the free&nbsp;enterprise, there are no restrictions on what the firms&nbsp;can produce. It is of no surprise, that there will be a&nbsp;much larger choice of goods and services in a free market&nbsp;economy compared with a command economy. Firms&nbsp;will always be looking to produce something new to get&nbsp;ahead of their competitors. Even though the government's&nbsp;role is limited, one of its jobs is to protect property&nbsp;rights. Hence, there are incentives in the free market&nbsp;system for firms to be innovative and produce better&nbsp;quality products.</p>
<p>Contrary to this, in a planned economy planners are&nbsp;less likely to make the correct decisions across the whole&nbsp;economy. The planner will be more concerned with&nbsp;making sure that there are enough essential goods to go&nbsp;around rather than allocating resources efficiently&nbsp;between all goods. Also there is no incentive for the&nbsp;planner to be innovative, as long as they produce the&nbsp;essentials the planners will be happy.<br>With all the advantages explained above free market&nbsp;system does have certain drawbacks.</p>
<p>There may be a problem with merit goods and demerit&nbsp;goods. Merit goods, like health and education, tend to&nbsp;be under provided in a free market. Demerit goods are&nbsp;bad for the people and they may be over consumed. A&nbsp;government with a limited role might not take enough&nbsp;action in this area. For many, income disparity alone is&nbsp;the biggest disadvantage of a free market economy. A&nbsp;few may grow as millionaires while unemployment and&nbsp;poverty also rises. A command economy might not have&nbsp;the efficiency and enterprise for the successful to make&nbsp;millions, but at least the strong government will try to&nbsp;make sure that nobody falls through the safety net. It&nbsp;will be a fairer economy, even though it is likely to be&nbsp;less successful overall.</p>
<p>Historically, free market system has proved to be more&nbsp;successful in terms of achieving economic efficiency,&nbsp;higher rates of economic growth and most importantly&nbsp;better living standards. The most successful economy in&nbsp;the world (in terms of size) has been the USA, and they&nbsp;have been one of the freest economies in the world.</p>
<p>This phenomenal economic success in the capitalist block&nbsp;led to the Berlin Wall falling down late in 1989, and&nbsp;along with it the concept of planned economies throughout&nbsp;Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This stark&nbsp;reality led to the growing desirability among masses to&nbsp;opt for free market system, where they could enjoy&nbsp;consumer sovereignty, wider choice and lower prices.&nbsp;The driving force for this change was people power.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 249</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8622</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the contributions of enterprise and division of labour to an economy.&nbsp; [8]</p>

Entrepreneurship&nbsp;is associated with the founding of new&nbsp;businesses, or taking the initiative in combining the&nbsp;resources of land, capital, and labor to produce a good&nbsp;or service. The entrepreneur is the driving force behind&nbsp;production and the agent who combines the other resources&nbsp;in what is hoped will be a successful business&nbsp;venture. As an innovator he is the one who attempts to&nbsp;introduce, on a commercial basis, new products, new&nbsp;productive techniques, or even new forms of business&nbsp;organization. The entrepreneur risks not only time, effort,&nbsp;and business reputation but his or her invested funds&nbsp;and those of associates.<br>The role of entrepreneur is of prime importance in a free&nbsp;market economy. It is the entrepreneur who decides what&nbsp;to produce, how to produce and where to produce.&nbsp;Without the entrepreneur, land, labour and capital are&nbsp;just masses of resources of no economic importance. It&nbsp;is the entrepreneur who organizes them for production&nbsp;and devices technical combinations of inputs to make&nbsp;the most efficient use of scarce resources.<br>Large production units allow the process of production&nbsp;to be broken down into a series of tasks. This is called&nbsp;division of labour. Adam Smith, in his book, showed&nbsp;how the production of pins would benefit from the&nbsp;application of the division of labour in a factory. He&nbsp;suggested that pin making could be divided into 18&nbsp;distinct operations and that each employee undertook&nbsp;only one of the operations, production would rise to&nbsp;5000 pins per employee per day. This was compared&nbsp;to his estimate that each employee would be able to&nbsp;produce only a few dozen each day if they produce&nbsp;pins individually.<br>Division of labour allows people to specialize in doing&nbsp;a job at which they can become both ·proficient and&nbsp;efficient. This improvement in efficiency results in higher&nbsp;productivity, mass output, reduction in per unit cost&nbsp;and prosperity in general.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 250</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8621</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether trade arrangements, such as the European Union or the South Asian Free Trade Area, encourage or discourage the benefits of free trade.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An important feature of international trade between countries over the last two decades has been a significant expansion of regional trade agreements (RTAs) across the global economy. In economic terminology integration occurs whenever two nations or a group of nations in the same region join together to form a regional trading bloc by raising trade barriers against the products of non-member countries while freeing internal trade among members.</p>
<p>Some of these trade arrangements are simply classified as free trade agreements, which is a fairly loose form of integration where countries agree to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers between them to promote free trade in goods and services. The South Asian Free trade Area (SAFTA) created in January 2006 and containing countries such as India and Pakistan along with six other nations, is a good example of this. Nations that levying common external tariffs while freeing internal trade are said to have formed a customs union. The most sophisticated RTAs for instance, European Union, go beyond traditional trade policy mechanisms, to include regional rules on flows of investment, coordination and adoption of various uniform policies in areas such as agriculture, transport, environment, regional and social affairs. The economic effects of the creation and development of different trade arrangements can be analyzed in terms of trade creation and trade diversion.</p>
<p>Trade creation involves a shift in domestic consumer spending from a higher cost domestic source to a lower cost partner source within the bloc, due to the abolition of tariffs on intra-group trade. So for example UK households may switch their spending on car and home insurance away from a higher-priced UK supplier towards a French insurance company operating in the UK market. Trade creation should stimulate an increase in intra-group trade within the trading bloc and should, in theory, lead to an improvement in the efficient allocation of scarce resources and gains in consumer and producer welfare.</p>
<p>The basic economic rationale for the formation of regional trading groups is that integration provides the opportunity for industries among the member countries to take advantage of economies of large-scale production by expanded markets. Integration therefore needs to be viewed as a mechanism to encourage specialization and division of labor among a group of countries. In the absence of integration, each separate country may not provide a sufficiently large domestic market to enable local industries to lower their production costs through economies of scale.</p>
<p>Furthermore, increased competition between member countries may stimulate efficiency, encourage investment and reduce monopoly powers. It might also result in more rapid spread of technology among the member states and improvement in terms of trade of the whole regional bloc with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Trade diversion, on the other hand, is said to occur when the erection of external barriers causes production and consumption to divert from lower-cost non-member sources of supply to higher-cost member producers. Trade diversion is normally considered undesirable because non. member countries with comparative advantage lose their market whereas member countries turn to less efficient domestic industries of member states. Thus both the world and member states are perceived to be worse off.</p>
<p>Also, within the group. the large scale low cost producers will benefit at the expense of nascent and smaller high cost producers, some of whom could be taken over or go out of business. Similarly, mergers among firms from member countries to develop large companies in order to gain market power may result in higher prices. If it results in the development of very large companies, they may become inefficient.</p>
<p>In addition, smaller members of the group may be dominated by relatively large members in terms of policy issues or, in particular, attractiveness of resources. Thus. smaller members may become a depressed region of the group.</p>
<p>Thus the overall effect of such trade arrangements on the economic welfare of citizens in a member country and non-member country depends on whether it creates effects that are mainly trade creating or trade diverting,</p>
<p>In conclusion it is pertinent to say that development of regional trading blocs may be better than facing trade barriers from individual nations but these blocs are inferior to world wide free trade agreements.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 251</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8620</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the 'infant industry' and anti-dumping arguments for the introduction of tariffs.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A tariff is a tax placed on imported commodities with the aim of raising their price and, therefore, discouraging their purchase. A tariff can take the form of a specific tax, i.e. a lump sum tax, where the tariff is based on a fixed amount on an imported item. Alternatively, it can be ad valorem, in which case it is based on a percentage of the price of the product. Apart from raising the price of imports relative to domestic products, tariffs can also act as a source of revenue for the government.</p>
<p>The effects of tariff on a 'particular imported product can be examined with the help of the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/636add0c8ce6f22bb99dd7a72ddb738a" alt="" width="411" height="299"></p>
<p>The assumption is made that the world supply, S<sub>w</sub>, is perfectly elastic at a price of P<sub>w</sub>, and that D<sub>d</sub> and S<sub>d</sub> are domestic demand and supply of the good. Before the imposition of a tariff the domestic price would be set at the world price P<sub>w</sub>. At this price domestic demand would be q<sub>4</sub> and domestic producers would be willing to supply q<sub>1</sub>. The result of this would be that the excess demand of q<sub>4</sub> - q<sub>1</sub> would be satisfied by importing the product.</p>
<p>The imposition of a tariff causes the domestic price of the product to increase from the world price of P<sub>w</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>. This will have the dual effect of reducing domestic demand to q<sub>3</sub> and increasing the amount domestic firms are willing to supply to q<sub>2</sub>. The desired outcome of the tariff will have been achieved, since imports of the product are now only q<sub>3</sub> - q<sub>1</sub>. However tariff will reduce consumer surplus by the area 1&nbsp;+2 + 3 + 4. Area 1 is the benefit to the producer, area 3 represents tariff revenue to the government and areas 2 and 4 do not benefit anyone. They are net welfare losses.</p>
<p>Among the several arguments put forward for the introduction of tariff possibly the best known is infant industry argument. An infant industry is one which has a potential comparative advantage. Such an industry is likely to have relatively high costs because, currently, it is too small to gain economies of scale and too young to have trading experience. Without protection, the industry might find it difficult to compete with established producers in other countries who are possibly benefiting from economies of scale. The authorities may feel that, if some of these nascent industries are allowed to develop domestically they could eventually become efficient enough to compete effectively in the world market. Therefore if tariff is placed on imports, native producers would be given the time needed to develop their efficiency to the point where they would be able to compete in the domestic market without any restrictions on imports. It may be difficult, however for a government to identify the potential infant industries which are likely to be successful.</p>
<p>Tariff may also be used to counter the threat of dumping. Dumping relates to a situation in which a company sells its product in an overseas market at a price lower than the cost of production. Dumping can be achieved through export subsidies provided by the home government or through ensuring that consumers in the home market pay a sufficiently high price to cover total costs. The aim of dumping may be to drive an overseas competitor out of business, in which case it is known as predatory dumping. This may involve the predatory firm selling its product in another country at a loss in the short run in order to destroy competition and create a monopoly, hence increasing excess profits in the long term. Clearly, if dumping leads to anti-competitive behaviour and prevents the emergence of comparative advantage, then introduction of tariff on dumped products can be justified. However, whether a good is truly being dumped on a market needs careful investigation before tariff can be placed.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 252</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8618</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, with the help of an example, the effects when a government introduces a maximum price for a good or service.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Maximum price, often called price ceiling, is the maximum legal price that a seller is allowed to charge for a product. The price is not allowed to rise above this level but it is permitted to fall below it. Government uses price ceiling in circumstances when equilibrium price set by the market forces for some essential product is unfairly high and it may not be affordable for less privileged. Price controls on oil, natural gas and rental housing are frequently imposed by many governments&nbsp;around the world. If the ceiling is set above the equilibrium price, it has no effect since the equilibrium remains attainable. However, the maximum price is set below the free market equilibrium price. The price ceiling lowers the price and is said to be binding or effective. The effects of maximum price on petrol are illustrated by the figure below:&nbsp;<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/565cc0a31079f26c369ad366714e415d" alt="" width="408" height="255"><br>The free market equilibrium price of petrol is at 'p' and quantity traded is oq. Government fixes a maximum at P<sub>1</sub> at this lower price. Oil companies, particularly those with higher costs, will supply less, and supply will be Q<sub>2</sub>. Consumers, on the other hand, will demand more at this low price; they would like to purchase the quantity Q<sub>2</sub>. So demand exceeds supply and a shortage q<sub>2</sub> - q<sub>1</sub> develops.<br>As a consequence of this maximum price some people gain and some lose. As the graph above clearly suggests, oil companies lose - they receive lower price, and some might leave the industry. Consumers who can purchase petrol at a lower price are clearly better off, but those who have been rationed out and cannot buy petrol due to the shortage are worse off. The gain to consumers is the difference between rectangle D and triangle B. The loss to producers is the sum of rectangle D and triangle C. Triangles B and C together measure the deadweight welfare loss from price controls. <br>Since maximum price undermines the rationing ability of the free market, hence at the ceiling price there is a lasting shortage of petrol. ln this situation when quantity supplied is insufficient to satisfy everyone who wishes to buy petrol, some other method of allocation must be adopted. For instance, petrol stations sell their available supplies on a "first come, first served" basis. Long queues of vehicles at petrol stations will develop, and allocation will be on the basis of luck. Alternatively sellers may keep products under the counter and sell only on the basis of favoritism. <br>Consequently, the government is required to adopt a system of rationing because an unregulated shortage leads to an inequitable (unfair) distribution of the product. <br>Rationing is when the government limits the amount of a good that people are allowed to purchase. The authorities can ration the goods by giving out ration coupons sufficient to buy the available supply. ln case of petrol the coupons might be distributed equally or on some criteria such as type of vehicle or occupation. <br>A major consequence of maximum price on petrol, with or without rationing, is the emergence of black markets. This is a market in which petrol will be sold illegally at whatever price equates illegal demand and supply. The existence of such a market depends on there being a few people willing to risk heavy penalties by running a black market and a large number of consumers prepared to purchase the product on such a market. For instance, black marketers would buy q<sub>2</sub> amount of petrol at the controlled price p<sub>1</sub> paying the amount shown by rectangle E. They would sell at the price P<sub>2,</sub> earning profits shown by the sum of rectangles A and D.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 253</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8617</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Economists also classify goods in others ways.

Firstly both the goods in question can be categorized together as economic goods because their production requires scarce resources and hence involves an opportunity cost. Conversely free goods, air and sunlight for instance. are plentiful in their availability therefore nothing has to be sacrificed in order to obtain them. Secondly the two products in question, depending on who holds them, can be viewed similar as either capital or consumer goods. Goods which directly satisfy consumer wants and are in the hands of consumer are labeled as consumer goods whereas stocks of consumer goods not yet in the hands of consumer are considered part of capital goods. In this case stocks of both cigarettes and vaccine held by the sellers would be considered as capital goods or else both these products in the hands of consumers are classified together as consumer goods. <br>Thirdly the two products in question are subject to the principles of exclusion and rivalry therefore can be classified together as private goods. The principle of exclusion states that all those who are unable or unwilling to pay for these goods can be excluded from the products' benefits while rivalry means one person's consumption of a packet of cigarettes or a vaccination against influenza reduces the amount left for others to consume and benefit from - because scarce resources are used up in producing and supplying them. On the contrary public goods such as street lights are non excludable and non rivalrous. The term non excludability suggests that there is no effective way of excluding individuals from their benefits once those goods come into existence. Non rivalry means when more people consume the product, the benefit to those already consuming the product is not diminished. Public goods, therefore, involve free rider problem, that is, we all want to be free riders when we believe that someone else will pay and then they will be available to all. Hence public goods cannot be supplied through markets as there is no effective demand registered in the market. <br>However an economist would not classify the two products in question as similar when he categorizes private goods into merit and demerit goods. In this context be would view a packet of cigarettes as a demerit good and a vaccination against influenza as a merit good. <br>A merit good is better for the consumer than the consumer perceives and a demerit good is worse for the consumer than the consumer realizes. In addition to this a merit good is associated with positive externalities whereas a demerit good is seen as a product that has negative externalities associated with it. Thus the essence of merit and demerit goods is to do with a failure of information to the consumer and spillover effects on non-consumers. In case of vaccination against influenza quite often people do not appreciate how good inoculation is for them. They do not perceive its full benefits at the time of making decision, therefore resulting in insufficient demand being registered for the product in the market and may be under-consumed because people under-value the product as shown in the graph below:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/99fdac98c4573115ffbf037e825f7e28" alt="" width="390" height="230"><br>Curve D<sub>1</sub> indicates the level of demand when consumers have all relevant information for decision making. However, the demand for influenza vaccine registered in the market is shown by the curve D because consumers may not feel the need to purchase due to the lack of information. Thus the market forces would provide oq amount only whereas oq<sub>1</sub> is the socially optimum quantity. Also an inoculation might be seen as a merit good as others who may not catch the disease from the inoculated person also benefit. <br>On the other hand people do not fully realize how bad the consumption of cigarettes is therefore consumers overvalue them and demand registered for them is higher than the socially optimum level. Furthermore, cigarettes can be seen as a demerit good because it inflicts external costs in terms of secondary smoking that can be viewed as possible cause of ill health for others as shown in the graph below: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c8fd644fe02b3bd2f78b47f7f7fa088d" alt="" width="414" height="246"><br>The social optimal level of consumption would be q<sub>1</sub> - an output that takes into account the information failure of consumers and also negative externalities. The market fails to take into account the negative externalities of consumption because the social cost &gt; private cost. Consumers too may experience imperfect information about the long term costs to themselves of consuming the products deemed to be demerit goods.<br>In the end it can be concluded that an economist would classify both the products in question together as private goods however he would view a packet of cigarettes as a demerit good and a vaccination against influenza as a merit good on the basis of the decisions made by individuals regarding how much to consume each of the two products and the implication of their decisions on allocation of scarce resources.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 254</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8616</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, with examples and diagrams, the effects of a decrease in incomes on the markets for normal and inferior goods.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A decrease in incomes represents the decline in financial ability of consumers to pay for a product. In majority cases there exists a positive relationship between income and demand for the products i.e. as incomes fall demand for most goods and services decreases. Products with this relationship are termed as normal goods. For example demand for products such as private transport or expensive restaurant meals, is expected to decrease due to a fall in incomes in general.</p>
<p>However there are other products that are characterized by a negative relationship between income and demand. For instance, as incomes fall demand for public transport is expected to rise. Products with this relationship are labeled as inferior goods.</p>
<p>Economists use the concept of income elasticity of demand (YED) in order to differentiate between these two types of products. YED is the responsiveness of demand to change in income alone and is measured by the following:</p>
<p>YED =&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proportionate change in quantity demanded) / (Proportionate change in income)</p>
<p>If YED is a positive value then a fall in incomes leads to a decrease in demand and the product is classified as normal. Conversely a negative value of YED suggests that a decrease in incomes results in an increase in demand. This inverse relationship between income and demand indicates that the product is considered inferior. YED for any one product also varies with the level of consumer's income as shown in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/73d518efdd85117fa8f3a494e341afc3" alt="" width="310" height="182"></p>
<p>The product is considered normal at low incomes but becomes an inferior good at incomes beyond I<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The YED&nbsp;of both normal and inferior goods can be greater than unity (income elastic) or less than unity (income inelastic), depending on whether the percentage change in the QD is greater or less than the percentage change in income. So the sign that precedes the YED indicates the nature of the relationship between income and demand; the numerical value tells us the strength of that relationship.</p>
<p>The effect of a decrease in incomes on the market of normal and inferior goods is illustrated by the following graphs. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/59d6ae80a265b212761fc48ffc51da72" alt="" width="387" height="170"><br>A decrease in incomes in general shifts the demand curve to the right for inferior products such as public transport and to the left for normal goods such as expensive restaurant meals. Demand for public transport rises from D to D<sub>1</sub> and results in both a rise in price and quantity traded leading to an increase in total revenue from opeq to op<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1</sub>q<sub>1</sub>. Whereas demand for restaurant meals decreases and results in both decrease in price and quantity traded, consequently leading to a fall in total revenue from opeq to op<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1</sub>q<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that demand for normal goods varies directly with incomes whereas demand for inferior goods varies in opposite direction with the change in incomes.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 255</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8614</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>The British Broadcasting Corporation<br></strong></p>
<p>The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a world-famous radio and television broadcaster.</p>
<p>In 2005 the services the BBC provided to the UK were part of the public sector and financed mainly by&nbsp;a compulsory annual licence fee of £121 on those households owning a television. There were heavy fines&nbsp;for those who did not pay.</p>
<p>The BBC has an obligation to provide programmes that are educational and cultural, as well as the more&nbsp;popular programmes such as comedy and sport.<br>One economist has argued that the BBC should receive more finance, that BBC broadcasting is a public good,&nbsp;and that it has greater value for viewers than they have to pay for. To support his view he produced two&nbsp;diagrams. Fig. 1 shows the demand for BBC services among the 23 million television-owning households in&nbsp;the UK and Fig. 2 shows where this economist placed BBC broadcasting among a selection of public goods&nbsp;in 2005.</p>

<li>The curve AB on the following PPC graph shows the trade off between the two&nbsp;types of programmes before increase in licence fees.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7555f9cfb0d032dd269ef18235a8b171" alt="" width="245" height="237"><br><br>More finances available to the programme makers due to increased licence fees&nbsp;would result in potential increase in resources at their disposal, hence enhances&nbsp;their capacity to produce both types of programmes more in number as shown&nbsp;by the shift in PPC from AB to CD.</li>
<li>TV licence and TV sets are complementary goods, therefore the two goods will&nbsp;have negative cross elasticity of demand. A rise in licence cost would result in&nbsp;some degree of demand reduction and a fall in price for TV sets as shown in&nbsp;the graph below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b53237b777f1c270457142783831e706" alt="" width="273" height="233"><br><br>The demand curve for TV sets shifts leftwards from D to D<sub>1</sub>, resulting in a fall&nbsp;in their price and quantity traded. This fall in both price and quantity traded&nbsp;would eventually result in a fall in sales revenue and profits for TV producing&nbsp;firms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In almost all markets, consumers collectively obtain more utility (satisfaction) from&nbsp;their purchases than the amount of their expenditures ( product price X quantity).&nbsp;This surplus of utility arises because some consumers are willing to pay more than&nbsp;the equilibrium price but need not do so. According to fig.1 a fraction less than 17&nbsp;million, out of a total of 23 million consumers, are willing to pay more than £ 121&nbsp;but end up paying £ 121 therefore, receive better value for their money. Only a&nbsp;fraction less than 6 million are willing to pay less than the prevailing license fee.&nbsp;Overall, more people are paying less than what they are willing to pay, therefore,&nbsp;obtain net benefit usually termed as consumer surplus.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Non excludability is when there is no effective way of excluding individuals from&nbsp;their benefits once those goods come into existence. Non-rivalry means when&nbsp;more people consume the product, the benefit to those already consuming the&nbsp;product is not diminished. National defense had both a greater degree of nonrivalry&nbsp;and non excludability than police services. On the scale of non excludability&nbsp;both national defense and police services are regarded as non excludible&nbsp;to a large extent. However, national defense is fraction higher than police services&nbsp;on this scale. On the scale of non rivalry people perceive national defense as&nbsp;a better example than police services because consumption of police services by&nbsp;one member of the public would reduce availability to others. National defense&nbsp;qualifies, to a great extent, as better example of public good than police services.</li>
<li>Public goods are non excludable and non rivalrous in their characteristics. That&nbsp;is, they can be jointly consumed by many individuals simultaneously without&nbsp;any discriminatory price system being applied. Public goods, therefore, involve&nbsp;free rider problem that is, we all want to be free riders when we believe that&nbsp;someone else will pay and then these goods would be available to all. Therefore,&nbsp;cannot be supplied through markets.<br>Education and health are usually considered to be merit goods or private goods&nbsp;rather than public goods. The principles of exclusion or rivalry can be applied&nbsp;on both education and health care. This simply implies that anyone who does&nbsp;not pay for them can be excluded from enjoying their benefits. For example, if&nbsp;a student is unable to pay the cost of a bachelor degree will be excluded from&nbsp;the degree program. Principle of rivalry means that if a surgeon is operating a&nbsp;patient other patients cannot benefit from his services at the same time. The&nbsp;patients are rivals for this resource, the amount of sergeon's time is scarce.&nbsp;Surgeon's services are therefore priced according to our levels of demand and&nbsp;supply of his time. There is nothing inherent in any of these particular goods&nbsp;that makes them different from private goods. They can be supplied through the&nbsp;market and in some countries they actually are.<br>What constitutes a merit good is defined by the political process according to&nbsp;what the government deems to be socially desirable. With the idea of a failure&nbsp;of information, a merit good is defined as a good that is better for a person than&nbsp;the person who may consume the good realizes. Under this definition education&nbsp;and healthcare are often characterised as merit goods rather than public goods.</li>

<li>An exchange rate refers to the external value of a&nbsp;country's currency. It refers to the amount of foreign<br>currency needed to buy one unit of the local currency.&nbsp;For example it may take US50¢ to buy 1 Singapore&nbsp;dollar.<br>In the long term, it would be the free market forces of&nbsp;demand and supply that determines the exchange rate.&nbsp;However, in the short term, there are, basically, three methods from which a government can choose from.<br>The first system is called the fixed exchange rate system.&nbsp;As the name implies, the rate is fixed by the central&nbsp;bank (CB) of the country. This rate, called the official&nbsp;rate, is maintained by constant intervention by the CB.<br>Refer to the diagram below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/92245ce96bbed9c53fd2d88c20192b96" alt="" width="363" height="163"><br><br>This is the foreign exchange market for Singapore dollars&nbsp;expressed in US$. The official rate is US50¢ to S$1.&nbsp;Initially the market demand (Ds$) and market supply&nbsp;(Ss$) intersects at the official rate.<br>There is equilibrium in the market. If the demand for&nbsp;S$ rises froth D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> (in the diagram below); the&nbsp;government CB will have to increase supply from S<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>to S<sub>1</sub> otherwise the market will not clear. There will be&nbsp;a shortage of q<sub>0</sub>q<sub>1</sub>. On the other hand, should the market&nbsp;supply increase the government will have to buy up its&nbsp;own currency in order to support it. This is done by&nbsp;selling away its reserves of other currencies. For this&nbsp;to work, it is necessary that the government maintains&nbsp;a buffer stock of currencies (official reserves).<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a2668de274712925d2693d6ccbec8c22" alt="" width="381" height="190"></li>
<li>An appreciation of the exchange rate for any currency&nbsp;will cause an improvement in the terms of trade, ceteris&nbsp;paribus. The terms of trade is a ratio of the price index&nbsp;of a basket of exports over the price index of a basket&nbsp;of imports expressed as an index. Thus when there is&nbsp;an appreciation of the exchange rate, the price index&nbsp;of exports in another country will rise and likewise, the&nbsp;price of imports in local currency will fall, Assuming&nbsp;ceteris paribus, the terms of trade will improve.<br>An improvement in the terms of trade will have an&nbsp;impact on the balance of payments of a country. If the&nbsp;demand for imports and exports are price inelastic, as&nbsp;it usually is in the short run, then there will be a net&nbsp;inflow of money and the balance of payments will&nbsp;improve. The diagrams below show this.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ab1919749aebedc436ede698338d837c" alt="" width="387" height="263"><br><br>When prices rise from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, quantity demanded will&nbsp;fall less than proportionately, from Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub>. Area A&nbsp;is larger than Area B, which shows that export revenue&nbsp;has risen in $US.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/15106827a46c138f55ba46da8448eddc" alt="" width="364" height="211"><br><br>When prices fall from P<sub>3</sub> to P<sub>4</sub>, quantity demanded will&nbsp;rise less than proportionately, from Q<sub>3</sub> to Q<sub>4</sub>. Area C&nbsp;is larger than Area D, which shows that import expenditure&nbsp;has fallen in Singapore dollars.<br>However, in the long run, both the price elasticity of&nbsp;demand for imports and for exports will usually tend&nbsp;to be elastic. As such, an appreciation will lead to a&nbsp;deterioration of the balance of trade in the long run,&nbsp;and the country will suffer a great loss. If the country&nbsp;has insufficient funds to pay the deficit, then it has to&nbsp;borrow and be in debt.<br>The trade deficit results in a net outflow of money. In&nbsp;Keynesian terms these leakages causes a backward&nbsp;multiplier process to operate.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/dc42ebbbe9c82986ad5c2df61285e7a6" alt="" width="314" height="195"><br><br>It leads to a fall in national income from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub>, and&nbsp;fall in employment. Thus living standards in the country&nbsp;fall.<br>Still, an appreciation can be beneficial in many ways.&nbsp;An appreciation of the exchange rate will reduce the&nbsp;price of imports. This will make the country less susceptible&nbsp;to imported inflation. Thus inflation is more&nbsp;stable and more easily controlled. This is the situation&nbsp;in Singapore, where the strong Sing dollar has safeguarded&nbsp;it against inflation from overseas.<br>An appreciation of the exchange rate is also beneficial&nbsp;if the country is a creditor nation, i.e. it lends money&nbsp;to other countries. When its currency appreciates, the&nbsp;country will get back more money in terms of the other&nbsp;countries' currencies. Thus the real value of the money&nbsp;it gets back, in its own currency, though numerically&nbsp;equal, is now worth more in real terms.<br>Conversely, if a country is a debtor, it will be at an&nbsp;advantage; as it now has to repay smaller amounts of&nbsp;money to its creditors than before the appreciation of&nbsp;its exchange rate.<br>Another major benefit to a country that is brought about&nbsp;by an appreciation of its exchange rate is that it is now&nbsp;able to invest more easily overseas. The strength of its&nbsp;currency will make investments in other countries&nbsp;cheaper. Increased investments like these will result in&nbsp;increased future growth and wealth.</li>

Goods&nbsp;can be classified into free or economic goods. The former&nbsp;entails no opportunity cost to people. This means that&nbsp;no one else is made worse off when a person consumes&nbsp;a free good. Examples are sea water, desert sand and&nbsp;air. An economic good, on the other hand, entails an&nbsp;opportunity cost. Some other good has to be foregone&nbsp;in order to create an economic good. The cause of this&nbsp;is scarcity, which is a situation where human demand&nbsp;exceeds the supply of factors needed to satisfy the&nbsp;demand.<br>Economic goods can further be subdivided into public&nbsp;and private goods. A public good is one that has 2&nbsp;unique characteristics that private goods do not. Firstly,&nbsp;public goods are non-exclusive (or non-excludable). This&nbsp;means that a producer or seller cannot separate nonpayers&nbsp;from benefiting from the good. As a result, the&nbsp;payer too, eventually does not want to pay. As a consequence,&nbsp;the market will not produce a public good.&nbsp;This is termed as market failure. Contrary to this, private&nbsp;good is one that has excludability. Only payers will be&nbsp;able to benefit from the good. As a consequence the&nbsp;market can provide.<br>Using the concept of externality for public goods, there&nbsp;are no private benefits or revenue for the producer at&nbsp;all but only benefit to society at large. Examples of&nbsp;public goods are street lighting, defence and radio&nbsp;broadcasts. In the case of private good, there are private&nbsp;benefits. There is revenue, and possibly profits for the&nbsp;producer who produces it. Examples are most things&nbsp;around us - books, pens, cars and houses.<br>The second unique characteristic is public goods are&nbsp;non-exhaustible. Thus means that the use by one person&nbsp;does not reduce the amount available to another. As a&nbsp;result, there is no rivalry in consumption. As a result&nbsp;too, there is no additional opportunity cost for the second&nbsp;and third person to use. Private goods are exhaustible&nbsp;- therefore having an opportunity cost on every additional&nbsp;unit consumed because they can be finished.&nbsp;Consumers have to compete for them.<br>Merit goods are classified into private goods because&nbsp;they are excludable and exhaustive. But merit goods&nbsp;have plenty of external benefits. This means that producers&nbsp;can earn revenue on the sale of such goods, and&nbsp;payers do benefit from what they pay for. But the benefit&nbsp;extends to society at large. Examples of merit goods&nbsp;are education and medicine.<br>Demerit goods have the features of private goods. They&nbsp;too have excludability. It is possible to separate the nonpayer&nbsp;from benefiting and the good can be finished.&nbsp;However, demerit goods have negative externalities. Its&nbsp;use by one person causes a 'loss' to a third party. For&nbsp;example. smoking&nbsp; where non-smokers suffer the inconvenience.&nbsp;Drug addiction where others are at risk&nbsp;when addicts are intoxicated. Private car driving where&nbsp;too much space is taken up by one person; denying a&nbsp;larger group the space. The production and consumption&nbsp;of any good or services that causes a loss to nonparticipants&nbsp;is a demerit good.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 258</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8606</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why economies make use of money.<br><br></p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Money has many functions and these are the reason for&nbsp;using it.<br>The most important function of money is to act as a&nbsp;medium of exchange. This means that all goods and&nbsp;services can be exchanged for this commodity, called&nbsp;money. Everybody accepts because the commodity can&nbsp;be exchanged again for other goods and services. This&nbsp;function solves the cumbersome problem of satisfying&nbsp;the double coincidence of wants that barter requires.<br>Money also acts as a store of wealth. Traditionally a&nbsp;rich man could store his wealth in the form of land,&nbsp;property, jewelry and other commodities. Money offers&nbsp;another alternative and the biggest advantage of money,&nbsp;as a store of wealth, is its liquidity - it can be reconverted&nbsp;into goods and services instantly.<br>Moreover, money is used as a standard for deferred payment.&nbsp;Because of its stable value in purchasing power.&nbsp;Producers or firms are prepared to offer their goods and&nbsp;services on credit. This again, facilitates and increases&nbsp;trade.<br>Lastly, money is used as a unit of measurement and a&nbsp;unit of account. The former means that money is able&nbsp;to price or give the exchange value of things accurately.&nbsp;Because it has many denominations, goods and services&nbsp;can be priced to the last cent. Barter was not able to&nbsp;this and divisibility was a problem. As a unit of account,&nbsp;money allows us to take stock of our wealth&nbsp;conveniently. A man's or a country's wealth is quoted&nbsp;in one number and not by the long list of things processed.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 259</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8604</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the differences in the features of a market&nbsp;economy and a planned economy.</p>
<p>Comment:<br>list out and describe the main features of a market economy and command&nbsp;(centrally-planned) economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Firstly, in a market economy there is private ownership&nbsp;of resources and finished goods. A man, a company or&nbsp;a family is allowed to own houses, land, cars, shares&nbsp;and livestock. They can transfer ownership to any other&nbsp;party they wish. In a command economy, all resources&nbsp;and finished goods are owned by the government or&nbsp;state. This is called collective ownership. Theoretically,&nbsp;all property is returned to a state when a person dies.&nbsp;There is no inheritance in such an economy.</p>
<p>Secondly, the allocation of resources is determined by&nbsp;a very unique system called the price mechanism in a&nbsp;market economy. The forces of demand, representing&nbsp;consumers and supply, representing producers determine&nbsp;the value or prices of goods. The price mechanism is&nbsp;the channel by which consumers signal to producers on&nbsp;the goods and their respective quantity they want. It&nbsp;also answers the question on how to produce and for&nbsp;whom to produce. The latter is called the distribution&nbsp;function. In this system, the highest bidder secures the&nbsp;good. However, in the command economy, all the above&nbsp;decisions are made on the basis of central-planning.&nbsp;The government though surveys, careful studies and&nbsp;investigations, decides on the 4 basic economic questions.&nbsp;Its aim is to maximise society's welfare.</p>
<p>In a market economy there is freedom of enterprise.&nbsp;People are allowed to organize themselves into business&nbsp;units where they organize factors of production. The&nbsp;objective is only to maximise profits for the entrepreneur.&nbsp;However, again in a command economy, there is&nbsp;no such freedom. Only the government produces and&nbsp;allocates goods to consumers. As its objective is to&nbsp;maximise society's welfare, the government will distribute&nbsp;goods as equally as possible. Its ideal is to have&nbsp;a classless society. In the market economy, the disparity&nbsp;between income groups can be quite large.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 260</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8601</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how the determination of a&nbsp;fixed exchange&nbsp;rate differs from that of a floating exchange rate.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An exchange rate refers to the external value of a&nbsp;country's currency. It refers to the amount or a foreign&nbsp;currency needed to buy one unit of the local currency.&nbsp;For example, it may take US50¢ to buy 1 Singapore&nbsp;dollar.</p>
<p>In the long term, it would be the free market forces of&nbsp;demand and supply that determines the exchange rate&nbsp;However, in the short term, there are, basically, three methods from which a government can choose from.</p>
<p>The first system is called the fixed exchange rate system.&nbsp;As the name implies, the rate is fixed by the central&nbsp;bank (CB) of the country. This rate, called the official&nbsp;rate, is maintained by constant intervention by the CB.<br>Refer to the diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1749ee99c1d4287f873b9fbe78879dde" alt="" width="365" height="170"></p>
<p>This is the foreign exchange market for Singapore dollars&nbsp;expressed in US$. The official rate is US50¢ to S$1.&nbsp;Initially the market demand (Dd S$) and market supply&nbsp;(SS S$) intersects at the official rate.</p>
<p>There is equilibrium in the market. If the demand for&nbsp;S$ rises from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> (in the diagram below); the&nbsp;government CB will have to increase supply from S<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>to S<sub>1</sub>; otherwise the market will not clear. There will&nbsp;be shortage of q<sub>0</sub>q<sub>1.</sub> On the other hand, should the market&nbsp;supply increase, the government will have to buy up&nbsp;its currency in order to support it. This is done by selling&nbsp;away its reserves of other currencies. For this to work,&nbsp;it is necessary that the government maintains a buffer&nbsp;stock of currencies (official reserves).</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/02917a23aeb8ff0aa307b3db7cf60857" alt="" width="366" height="185"></p>
<p>The second system is the market system. It has been&nbsp;called the floating, free-fluctuating and flexible exchange&nbsp;rate system. The rate is determined by the free market&nbsp;forces of demand and supply, which is allowed to change&nbsp;even on a daily basis. The government does not intervene&nbsp;to maintain a particular rate; although the CB does&nbsp;buy and sell currencies for its own needs. The market&nbsp;clears because the rate is allowed to change. If demand&nbsp;rises, the rate, in turn rises which attracts sellers. In the&nbsp;diagram below, the rate rose from US$0.50 to US$0.70&nbsp;per S$ when the demand rose from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. The higher&nbsp;rate caused supply to increase from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1</sub> quantity.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/29337356e451688d0ccb18aa6d21ab83" alt="" width="339" height="163"></p>
<p>Likewise, when the supply increases in the market, the&nbsp;price is allowed to fall; this induces buying of the&nbsp;currency. In this system, there is no necessity for the&nbsp;government to maintain reserves for stabilization purposes.&nbsp;However, there will be plenty of currency fluctuations.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 261</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8598</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the operation of a market economy always produces a desirable outcome.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>In a free enterprise economy, the government or central&nbsp;authority does not decide what goods to produce, how&nbsp;they are to be produced and which individuals or group&nbsp;should have what goods and how much of each. Production&nbsp;and distribution are governed by the price or&nbsp;market mechanism. A market is defined as a network&nbsp;within which buyers and sellers of a particular good are&nbsp;in such close communication that the price of the good&nbsp;tends to be the same everywhere.</p>
<p>The price mechanism works through the interaction of&nbsp;market forces. They determine the prices of goods and&nbsp;services and the prices of factors of production (in this&nbsp;case, it is labour).</p>
<p>The motive of production is profit. The decisions of&nbsp;consumers determine the demand for goods and services:&nbsp;the decision of producers determine the supply&nbsp;of commodities. The interaction of demand and supply&nbsp;determines the price of the good. Changes in demand&nbsp;and supply lead to changes in market prices, which in&nbsp;tum affect the ways in which resources are being allocated.</p>
<p>Is it best to leave the allocation of goods and labour&nbsp;to the price mechanism? The answer lies in the following&nbsp;discussion.</p>
<p>An advantage of using the price mechanism is that the&nbsp;allocation and distribution of resources is efficiently&nbsp;performed without the need for an extensive central&nbsp;authority. Through a system of prices, people's preferences&nbsp;for different goods and services are being registered.&nbsp;Like a marvelous computer, these preferences&nbsp;are transmitted to those responsible for producing the&nbsp;goods, and moving the factors to produce them. All&nbsp;these occur without employing a host of officials.</p>
<p>Secondly the goods and services produced would be&nbsp;determined by price signals, which reflect consumer&nbsp;wants. Consumers are given the freedom to choose what&nbsp;they wish to have rather than goods and services imposed&nbsp;upon them, as would have occurred under the command&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the price system leads to efficiency in the&nbsp;allocation of resources. Competition among firms forces&nbsp;them to choose the least-cost production techniques, thus&nbsp;avoiding wastages. Furthermore, maximum economic&nbsp;value is obtained from a given set of resources at any&nbsp;point of time. Not only is there no wastage of resources,&nbsp;all resources are also being put to their best or most&nbsp;profitable uses.</p>
<p>There are disadvantages of using the price mechanism.&nbsp;Firstly a perfectly performing price system does not&nbsp;provide for the issue of an ethical income distribution.&nbsp;In such a system, the limited supplies of goods and&nbsp;services are rationed out to those who have the money&nbsp;to buy them. This may mean that the scarce resources&nbsp;are diverted to the production of luxuries for the rich&nbsp;before an adequate output of commodities for the poor&nbsp;is produced. This explains why in most countries, the&nbsp;government intervenes in one way or another to correct&nbsp;the inequalities that arise from the automatic operation&nbsp;of the price system. Under the price system, for instance,&nbsp;education may be an expensive commodity. If&nbsp;education is sold according to what consumers can pay,&nbsp;then the poor will hardly have a chance to be educated.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the non-provision of vital services, like&nbsp;merit goods and services, essential services for example&nbsp;health and education which would benefit everybody&nbsp;may not be provided in adequate amounts under the&nbsp;price system because they are not profit-yielding. In&nbsp;most advanced countries, the state now provides for&nbsp;what is considered to be basic needs such as medical&nbsp;care, insurance against sicknesses, industrial accidents,&nbsp;education etc.</p>
<p>Then there are public goods. There are some goods, for&nbsp;example defence and street lightning, which can be&nbsp;consumed only on a public, or collective basis. Such&nbsp;goods, known as public goods, cannot be purchased in&nbsp;small amounts by households and individuals. Furthermore;&nbsp;another individual cannot be excluded from&nbsp;consuming these goods if he has not paid for them. The&nbsp;price system is, not capable of providing such goods&nbsp;because it can be effective only when prices rightly&nbsp;reflect the wants of consumers.<br>The price system does not consider all the costs and&nbsp;benefits associated with the production and consumption&nbsp;of commodities. Because they are profit-motivated,&nbsp;producers ignore the costs of benefits that they impose&nbsp;on society as a result of their activities. Similarly, for&nbsp;the consumers. Such costs of benefits are termed externalities.&nbsp;Externalities accrue to parties other than the&nbsp;immediate buyer and seller involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>The price mechanism does not always function smoothly&nbsp;and perfectly because of imperfect flow of information.&nbsp;Businessman or producers do not always know when&nbsp;consumers demand will change and may produce to&nbsp;much or too little.</p>
<p>Also, many producers may not be aware of the cheapest&nbsp;method of production. There may also be inadequate&nbsp;information regarding &nbsp;job opportunities. Consequently,&nbsp;labour is not mobile between industries and occupations.&nbsp;Hence there may be shortage of some types of&nbsp;labour. In sum, imperfections in information (on prices)&nbsp;make it impossible for buyers and sellers to react&nbsp;correctly enough to changing conditions.<br>In conclusion, the price mechanism may not be the best&nbsp;method in the allocation of goods and resources. The&nbsp;government's discretionary intervention is sometimes&nbsp;needed to correct any market failures.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 262</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8597</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>An economy is faced by the exhaustion of an important natural resource at a time when it is&nbsp;introducing improved technology.</p>

<p>The PPC is drawn on the following assumptions: factors&nbsp;of production are fixed and limited. Technology is&nbsp;constant and labour productivity stays the same. In fact&nbsp;we simply assume ccteris paribus (all other factors remaining&nbsp;constant). Based on these, the PPC will look&nbsp;like any of the 3 below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/828ec924526443ae181f4cf69d5fe0b0" alt="" width="269" height="116"></p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6a7883df8c527b0356a0254a32cc4a21" alt="" width="264" height="115"></p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/9509ab635764e2524fa643796d24353d" alt="" width="268" height="116"><br><br>It slopes downward because of scarcity but PPC<sub>1</sub> shows&nbsp;increasing opportunity cost, PPC<sub>2</sub> shows falling opportunity&nbsp;cost and PPC<sub>3</sub> shows constant opportunity cost.</p>
<p>As given, when a country's resources (natural raw&nbsp;material) are being depleted, the PPC will shift inwards.&nbsp;With fewer resources, its maximum production is now&nbsp;less:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8ecb14c83c9671579c5180b87cbccd65" alt="" width="279" height="122"></p>
<p>Here we assume other factors stay constant. However&nbsp;if new technology is being discovered - and introduced,&nbsp;the PPC will shift outward. New technology (and&nbsp;more of it) is capital; a man-made resource.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/bf1936416a6c1a64fc3816ba051295d9" alt="" width="277" height="122"></p>
<p>If this second factor offsets the earlier factor; then the&nbsp;PPC, overall, will shift outwards.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8b6d4d263728cf2ab79437854f6c6af8" alt="" width="257" height="108"></p>
<p>Most countries in the world experience this trend.&nbsp;Science and technology gives new capital. This always&nbsp;offsets the lost in natural resources. PPC<sub>3</sub> is the final&nbsp;PPC.</p>

<li>Exchange rate is the amount of domestic currency&nbsp;needed to be given up for one unit of currency of the&nbsp;other country. It is defined as the price of one currency&nbsp;in terms of another currency. The three types of exchange&nbsp;rate regimes are, fixed, floating and managed&nbsp;float exchange rate. With reference to the question, the&nbsp;floating exchange rate is determined by the forces of&nbsp;the demand and supply of the currency. The point of&nbsp;intersection determines the exchange rate. There is no&nbsp;government intervention in the determination of the&nbsp;exchange rate which means that the government does&nbsp;not have an official rate over it. The determination of&nbsp;the exchange rate under the floating exchange rate is&nbsp;illustrated in the diagram below. Take the case of the&nbsp;Singapore dollar (S$) against the US$.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/021782051a9d1770c46fa390ea1941dc" alt="" width="280" height="171"><br><br>As shown in the diagram above, D<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>0</sub> are the&nbsp;original demand and supply of the currency respectively,&nbsp;and P<sub>0</sub> is the original exchange rate. Supply of&nbsp;the currency is influenced by the people of the country,&nbsp;who want to buy imports or they wish to invest in&nbsp;foreign countries. Also, it can be supplied by anyone&nbsp;in the world who has it. On the other hand, the demand&nbsp;for the currency is influenced by foreigners who wish&nbsp;to buy imports from the domestic country or when they&nbsp;wish to invest in the country. Also, it can be demanded&nbsp;by anyone in the world who wants it. The effect of a&nbsp;change in either the demand or supply of the currency,&nbsp;or even both will affect the exchange rate of the country.<br><br>Take the case of a factor that would affect the supply&nbsp;of the exchange rate - a change in the&nbsp;rate of compulsory savings imposed by the government.&nbsp;When the rate of the compulsory savings is raised,&nbsp;the supply of the currency is reduced from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.This is due to the fact that people now have lesser&nbsp;money in hand or disposable income to purchase&nbsp;imports. Ceteris paribus, the exchange rate strengthens&nbsp;or appreciates. The supply of the Singapore currency&nbsp;would also fall if the government adopts a contractionary&nbsp;fiscal policy, or if there is a change in the taste away&nbsp;from imported goods. Or, if the government imposes&nbsp;tariffs or quotas against imports; with an elastic demand.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/fd6baf9bd65d94315b9a4ff58161d2a7" alt="" width="348" height="211"><br><br>Factors that could influence the demand would be when&nbsp;there is political instability, the demand of the country's&nbsp;currency could decrease to Dr Ceteris paribus, the&nbsp;exchange rate of the currency is reduced from P<sub>0</sub> to&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub>. The domestic currency weakens. On the flip side,&nbsp;an improvement in the quality of exports would increase&nbsp;the demand of the currency to D<sub>1</sub> as shown in&nbsp;the figure. This is due to the fact that more people&nbsp;nowadays desire better quality products. Ceteris paribus,&nbsp;the price of currency in US dollar rises which&nbsp;means that domestic currency strengthens.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d15c2586b04cff177a6a9a8b25ab37ce" alt="" width="340" height="203"><br><br>Factors that would influence both the demand and supply&nbsp;would be speculation and monetary policy. When people&nbsp;expect the currency to appreciate soon, they will increase&nbsp;their demand for it, shifting the demand curve&nbsp;upwards, ceteris paribus causing the exchange rate to&nbsp;appreciate. On the other hand, when they expect the&nbsp;currency to fall, they will give up the currency and the&nbsp;supply curve will shift to the right, ceteris paribus&nbsp;causing the exchange rate to depreciate.<br><br>An expansionary monetary policy increases the money&nbsp;supply which, ceteris paribus reduces interest rates.&nbsp;Interest rates is the cost of borrowing money or the&nbsp;reward for savings. The cost of borrowing money is&nbsp;lower which encourages borrowing. If people were to&nbsp;spend on imports, the supply of the currency increases,&nbsp;which ceteris paribus, decreases the exchange rate. At&nbsp;the same time, capital outflow occurs, moving out of&nbsp;the country causes the demand for the currency to fall&nbsp;and supply to increase. In conclusion, this is how the&nbsp;exchange rate of a country under a floating exchange&nbsp;rate changes.</li>
<li>An appreciation of the Singapore currency means that&nbsp;it becomes stronger against foreign currency. For example,&nbsp;the original exchange rate between Singapore&nbsp;and USA is S$1 = US$0.45 but when the Singapore&nbsp;dollar strengthens against the US$, the exchange rate&nbsp;is now S$1 = US$0.80. Just as there are advantages to&nbsp;the currency appreciating, there are also disadvantages.<br><br>In the capital account, the theory states that, foreign&nbsp;and local investments may drop or may pull out of the&nbsp;country because it is more expensive to undertake&nbsp;production for exports, and entrepreneurs are often&nbsp;profit-maximising. It would thus be unprofitable to&nbsp;undertake further investments. When disinvestments&nbsp;occur, the multiplier works backward, where ceteris&nbsp;paribus, income, employment and standard of living in&nbsp;Singapore will fall via the multiplier. This is shown in&nbsp;the diagram below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d6440d829ce72340f4b9de9e3a5eaf96" alt="" width="357" height="198"><br><br>From reference to the diagram above, AD<sub>0</sub> and Y<sub>0</sub> are&nbsp;the original aggregate demand and national income respectively.&nbsp;When AD<sub>0</sub> falls to AD, because there is a&nbsp;fall in investment (investment is a component of the&nbsp;aggregate demand, AE = C + I + G + X - M), the multiplier&nbsp;will work backward which results in a multiple&nbsp;fall in the national income to Y. A following fall in&nbsp;employment and standard of living occurs.<br><br>However, this may not occur in Singapore because&nbsp;Foreign Direct Investors (FDIs) do not only consider&nbsp;the currency. Other factors which can affect investments&nbsp;in Singapore are also considered by investors. For example,&nbsp;her low taxes, especially corporate taxes are one&nbsp;of the lowest in the world invites investments because&nbsp;entrepreneurs find it more worthwhile to invest.&nbsp;Singapore's highly productive labour also encourages&nbsp;investments. Also, Singapore has extensive infrastructure&nbsp;such as the airport and good and efficient road&nbsp;networks. In addition, Singapore is financially and&nbsp;politically stable which has caused FDIs to flood&nbsp;Singapore recently.<br><br>A stronger currency makes imports cheaper in the&nbsp;domestic currency, and exports more expensive in&nbsp;foreign currency. In the long run when the demand and&nbsp;supply of these goods becomes elastic, the country's&nbsp;current account worsens as illustrated in diagram a&nbsp;below which reflects the J-curve, but in the opposite&nbsp;way.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/9ef215ce45a2c41268a1cfc1c7a900b9" alt="" width="418" height="190"><br><br>The Marshall Lerner condition states that the sum of&nbsp;elasticities of demand and supply must be more than&nbsp;one for the current account to improve. This is for&nbsp;devaluation. For revaluation, the current account will&nbsp;worsen if the Marshall Lerner condition is true. With&nbsp;reference to diagram b, since elasticities of demand&nbsp;and supply are inelastic, the current account would improve.&nbsp;This is because when the imports are cheaper&nbsp;in domestic currency, ceteris paribus, the quantity&nbsp;demanded for the imports increases less than proportionately.&nbsp;On the other hand, when the exports are more&nbsp;expensive in foreign currency, the quantity demanded&nbsp;of exports fall less than proportionately. In the long run&nbsp;the current account improves. This can also be illustrated&nbsp;in the two diagrams below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6a551ba32c2494692c72fc69dd6b2700" alt="" width="356" height="203"><br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/30bd554a0e566c297c5f8356b5a5eb8f" alt="" width="354" height="196"><br><br>As shown in the above diagram, D<sub>0</sub> and P<sub>0</sub> is the price&nbsp;of exports in US dollar and q<sub>0</sub> the quantity of exports.&nbsp;When Singapore dollar strengthens, the price of exports&nbsp;in US dollar increases to P<sub>1</sub>. Ceteris paribus, the&nbsp;quantity demanded falls less than proportionately to q<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;since demand is inelastic in the short run. The gain in&nbsp;total revenue is more than the loss in total expenditure&nbsp;as shown in the diagram. In the other diagram, D<sub>0</sub> is&nbsp;demand for imports in the local currency and P<sub>0</sub> is the&nbsp;price of imports in Singapore dollars. The demand for&nbsp;imports is also price inelastic. When the exchange rate&nbsp;rises, price of imports in Singapore currency falls to&nbsp;P<sub>1</sub>. Ceteris paribus, the quantity demanded for the&nbsp;currency increases less than proportionately to q<sub>1</sub>. The&nbsp;fall from total spending is more than the rise in import&nbsp;spending as reflected in the diagram.<br><br>However, since the question refers to Singapore, it is&nbsp;possible that this situation may not be true for Singapore.&nbsp;This is because developed countries are the ones who&nbsp;buy our exports and they are more interested in the&nbsp;quality of the products, which Singapore is known to&nbsp;produce. Therefore, in the long run, the Singapore's&nbsp;current account will improve because the price elasticities&nbsp;of her exports remain inelastic. The typical J-curve&nbsp;would not apply to Singapore because of this. Instead,&nbsp;it will extend upwards as shown in the earlier diagram.&nbsp;In addition, even if the Singapore currency appreciates,&nbsp;her exports in the foreign currency are still cheaper&nbsp;than their domestic goods which are substitutes. Therefore,&nbsp;Singapore will benefit from it because she is able&nbsp;to enjoy higher income, a higher standard of living and&nbsp;an improved balance of payments.<br><br>Another benefit of a stronger Singapore dollar is that,&nbsp;since Singapore is going regional and global in investments,&nbsp;the strong currency makes it easier for her&nbsp;investors as it gives them a competitive edge over the&nbsp;others. It is cheaper for Singapore to invest in other&nbsp;countries because their currencies are now cheaper. In&nbsp;the future when entrepreneurs from Singapore send&nbsp;profits back from investments overseas, it will improve&nbsp;the balance of payments current account. The multiplier&nbsp;then works forward, raising the national income,&nbsp;followed by a rise in employment, output and standard&nbsp;of living.<br><br>Lastly, the strong currency helps to keep the inflation&nbsp;rate low. Inflation is the persistent rise in the general&nbsp;price level in an economy. Since the average&nbsp;Singaporean imports from Malaysia, Thailand and&nbsp;Indonesia which are develonino countries when the&nbsp;Singapore dollar strengthens, all imports become cheaper&nbsp;in Singapore dollars and real income increases. It will&nbsp;also not give a current account deficit because of the&nbsp;high CPF of (35% of incomes) and national savings&nbsp;(45% of GDP). Demand for imports by Singaporeans&nbsp;thus remain inelastic because they cannot buy more&nbsp;imports, but only pay less for them.<br><br>In conclusion, the benefits that a stronger Singapore&nbsp;currency would bring are economic growth, a healthy&nbsp;balance of payments, low inflation and increased&nbsp;employment. Thus all the main macro economic objectives&nbsp;could be achieved in Singapore.</li>

Members of the labor force who cannot find work can be termed as being unemployed. In Singapore's case, as long as a person is working, even if his job does not match his qualifications, as far as the government is concerned, he is employed. <br>Singapore is a small country with limited resources. The jobs and prosperity level in the country depends on external demand. Singapore experiences unemployment both on the demand and supply side. Unemployment on the supply side can be grouped into structural, frictional and voluntary unemployment (Singapore does not have voluntary unemployment as the government does not hand out welfare benefits) and unemployment on the demand side is referred to as either cyclical or recessionary unemployment.</p>
<p>Supply side policies would work for structural and frictional unemployment but not for cyclical unemployment.</p>
<p>People who are structurally unemployed are those workers who are unemployable currently due to the fact that they have no skills or have outdated skills. The main cause of structural unemployment is technological advancement. The Singapore government has continuously campaigned for technology to keep Singapore competitive in its various industries so as to remain cost effective. The problem however, is that technology displaces workers and makes them redundant. Examples of this would be the EZ-link card which has made bus conductors redundant and the setting up of self service kiosks in banks which have made many staff working there redundant. The rapid rise in living standards has resulted in a rise in cost of living and thus there has been a need to give in to the higher wage demands of workers. As such, Singapore has lost its comparative advantage in many of its earlier industries (like manufacturing) to neighbouring countries. The unexpected, sudden rise of China and India that took away thousand's of jobs from Singapore has only exacerbated the problem.</p>
<p>The long term solution to this would be to undertake supply side policies to regain Singapore's competitiveness as an investment centre (to attract foreign investments), develop new higher value industries and hence in the process also create more jobs. Singapore depends a lot on FDI due to the fact that they come with new industries, technology, management skills and jobs and training. Singapore has&nbsp;money but it lacks the above factors. Singapore has been, for example, successful in 2 new industries, namely stem cell research and running an up market casino.</p>
<p>The type of supply side policies to pursue would be to have complete political stability, good infrastructure, very low corporate taxes, a liberalized labor market, open door policy to foreign workers, allowing a free flow of international funds, very low income taxes (which encourages talent to stay in Singapore or migrate to Singapore, hence preventing brain drain), focus on education inculcating the concept of live long learning, and no state welfare (which keeps Singaporeans on their toes, making sure they always upgrade their skills and it also keeps wages down). With all these policies in place, foreign MNC's would be more attracted to Singapore and hence this would lead to them setting up new industries that come hand in hand with new jobs. Then comes the massive task of reeducating workers. Government educational institutions and the NTUC run many full and part-time courses which are subsidised. Even private education can claim government support.</p>
<p>Another type of unemployment is frictional unemployment and such unemployment arises when there are workers in between jobs or in between school leaving and jobs. The main cause of this is imperfect knowledge in the labour market and also the fussiness of workers.</p>
<p>The supply side solution for this problem would be to provide placement services for such people. The ministry of manpower and NTUC run several services in helping workers to find jobs and employers to find the right workers. They also provide a few free job websites. The government can also encourage private employment agencies to provide the&nbsp;same service by administering low corporate taxes on employment agencies. In the case of bussiness, the policy of no welfare for the unemployed and the policy of open door to foreigners compel Singaporeans to be realistic and accept any available job. Otherwise, they will run dry of savings and foreigners may grab all the available jobs.</p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment is another type of unemployment. Here, supply side policies would not work at all. Singapore's cyclical or recessionary unemployment is imported. Since&nbsp;Singapore is a very export orientated country whereby 150% - 200% of the country's GDP is taken up by exports. It exports&nbsp;mainly to developed countries like US, Japan and Europe. Therefore, when these countries are in recession there is&nbsp;nothing much Singapore can do.</p>
<p>However, supply side policies are used to sit out a recession. The policy of having a high level of private and&nbsp;government savings is an example. Singapore saves 45% of GDP (which is the highest in the world) and so during a recession, Singapore has money to buy food and busy the people by upgrading skills and building up infrastructure. In the long term, perhaps supply side policies can be used to preempt cyclical unemployment. Using public and government funds the economic development board can seek new markets for Singapore in the world so that we do not over depend on US markets like we do currently. Thus, when USA is in a recession, Singapore can switch to exporting to countries lfke China, India or the Middle East. Supply side policies can also be used to develop new industries which are recession resistant. Recently Singapore has been trying to go into such industries like banking, high value manufacturing, biotechnological and medical industries. Unfortunately, the casino is not one of them (it is very recessionary-prone).</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 265</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8593</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The annual inflation rate in Singapore rose from 0.5% in&nbsp;2003 to 1.7% in 2004.&nbsp;Discuss whether an increase in the rate of inflation is&nbsp;more likely to cause problems for the domestic or the&nbsp;external sector of the Singapore economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Singapore is a small country with limited resources and a small population. It is also a very open economy and makes its living from trade (exports as a percentage of GDP is 150%). Also for the last two decades, Singapore has been enjoying a high standard of living. Other nations prefer Singapore exports as they are price and value competitive. We offer value for money. Thus it can be concluded that an increase in the rate of inflation will have a more detrimental effect on the external&nbsp;sector of the Singapore economy.</p>
<p>Ceteris paribus, if price of exports increases (during a period where inflation in Singapore, which has been&nbsp;going on for many years, is higher than it is in other nations) Singaporean exports will become less competitive. As such, this results in a fall in demand for exports and an increase in demand for imports.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f817f6faa1c430abe0ec62dccc612e96" alt="" width="373" height="205"></p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b96ad1a76dcb31fbf74bcffe3e7d5b03" alt="" width="412" height="191"></p>
<p>Therefore this worsens Singapore's current account. Due to the net withdrawals that have taken place, the multiplier works backwards.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/034977f501a64a0e500551e0415910d9" alt="" width="359" height="181"></p>
<p>When the multiplier has taken full effect, the economy would have shrunk by the multiplied amount of times hence causing a fall in income, employment and standard of living.</p>
<p>However, the impact as described above may be limited. Although price of exports have increased, the demand for Singaporean exports may still be there as Singapore depends on quality, selling to developed countries for whom quality comes first and price is a&nbsp;secondary factor to consider. Thus Singapore may just suffer a smaller surplus rather than a deficit.</p>
<p>If inflation is cost push, meaning wages are going up fast, GST (indirect taxes) is increasing rapidly and land rent and general utility charges are rising rapidly then general cost of production would be increasing too quickly. If this situation persists for a few years ( ceteris paribus), it will adversely affect Singapore's capital account. Singapore has always been attractive to foreign investments due to its political stability, good infrastructure, low taxes and labor productivity. Recently&nbsp;however, other countries like Malaysia and Thailand have been eroding Singapore's attractiveness by catching up with her. The emergence of China and India as alternative investment destinations has also threatened Singapore's attractiveness as an investment hub. Thus, if cost push inflation erodes Singapore's competitiveness for investment then divestment would occur whereby FDl's would leave the country, local companies&nbsp;would relocate and new firms would then chose&nbsp;no to come in. This results in an even more serious&nbsp;backward multiplier effect on the whole economy.</p>
<p>As seen from the above discussion, it is evident that external effects of inflation are directly connected to internal effects.</p>
<p>High inflation (domestic) has the potential to disrupt the economy. If workers and unions start to clamor for higher wages and the pay increases much faster than productivity, a wage-price spiral would result and this would effectively erode Singapore's export competitiveness even further. However, this is a very unlikely situation as in Singapore, union action is seldom taken. This is because unions are government controlled and Singapore's industrial culture hasn't got this practice of strikes. Also, government policy on foreign workers makes most Singaporeans afraid to strike (due to the threat of foreign workers taking over local jobs). Instead, the higher inflation will lead to a higher cost of living which translates into lower real income (affecting those in the lower/lower middle income groups especially) for everyone. Suffering a fall in real income and living standards, Singaporeans will end up working longer hours and may even be forced into taking second jobs - living a miserable life. This is just to make ends meet.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 266</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8592</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The annual inflation rate in Singapore rose from 0.5% in&nbsp;2003 to 1.7% in 2004.&nbsp;Explain how monetary factors can cause inflation.</p>

The government carries out the&nbsp;expansionary monetary policy by buying bonds to&nbsp;increase supply of cash money in the country or by&nbsp;lowering the cash ratio to increase money supply or&nbsp;by relaxing all the regulations on credit (whereby it&nbsp;becomes easier to qualify as a borrower).

<li>Wages or the price of labour, like other factors, is&nbsp;determined by the free market forces of demand and&nbsp;supply. The wage rate earned is derived when the supply&nbsp;of labour meets the demand for it. Wages can rise due&nbsp;to the forces of demand or supply or other factors which&nbsp;are independent of a change in the demand for and&nbsp;supply oflabour. This essay aims to examine the reasons&nbsp;that account for a rise in wage rate.<br><br>Firstly, wages can rise if demand for labour rises, holding&nbsp;the supply of labour and other factors constant. As&nbsp;shown in the figure below, a rising demand from D<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;to D<sub>1</sub> causes a shortage at the initial wage rate of W<sub>0</sub>.&nbsp;Wages rise till W<sub>1</sub> till the shortage is eliminated. Hence,&nbsp;a rise in wages can be due to a rise in demand for&nbsp;labour itself. There are several reasons that explain a&nbsp;rise in the demand for labour. As the demand for labour&nbsp;is a derived one, it means that a rise in the demand&nbsp;for the finished good (the MR) will cause the demand&nbsp;for labour to rise, leading to a rise in the wage rate.&nbsp;Also, the increase in productivity or the marginal&nbsp;physical product of labour will lower costs. The firm&nbsp;is able to produce more with fewer workers who are&nbsp;skilled. This will cause an increase in the demand for&nbsp;labour, causing wages to rise.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/eebeaf167fdd72234c99de3f13244fbc" alt="" width="342" height="180"><br><br>Secondly, a fall in supply of labour can also cause wage&nbsp;rates to increase if we assume demand is constant. This&nbsp;can be due to many factors. Assuming the cutoff&nbsp;point to enter the dentistry faculty has been raised&nbsp;from 55 to 60 for instance. It will be more difficult for&nbsp;one to enter the course and cause a fall in supply of&nbsp;dentists as shown by the shift of the supply curve&nbsp;from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. This will cause a shortage at the initial&nbsp;W<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>wage rate and wages will rise till it reaches W<sub>1</sub> where&nbsp;the shortage is eliminated. The increase in educational&nbsp;requirements to be able to join an occupation is one of&nbsp;the reasons in which the supply of labour is restricted&nbsp;or reduced causing a rise in wages.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/762ff19ecb5ba3b1dfac5e733e84b177" alt="" width="321" height="163"><br><br>There are other reasons as well such as a change in&nbsp;government policy. For instance, if the government decides&nbsp;to impose a quota on foreign workers in a particular&nbsp;industry, there will be a shortage of workers&nbsp;causing a rise in wages as well.<br><br>Also, the existence and influence of trade unions that&nbsp;monopolize the supply oflabour can reduce the supply&nbsp;of labour in order to force the wage rates of existing&nbsp;workers to rise. The effectiveness of the ability of trade&nbsp;unions to control the supply of labour depends on the&nbsp;influence it has and is largely successful if it were a&nbsp;monopoly in the labour market.<br><br>Also, an increase in wages paid for jobs which require&nbsp;the same educational qualifications and skills can also&nbsp;cause a fall in supply of labour in the job with the&nbsp;lower pay. Take the case of the job of a receptionist&nbsp;for example. If a clerk is paid $1000 for working in&nbsp;an office and can be paid up to $1200 if she works&nbsp;as a receptionist in a hotel, with the same educational&nbsp;qualifications and skills, then there would be a fall in&nbsp;those willing and able to work as clerks. This would,&nbsp;eventually, increase the wage rate of the clerks ceteris&nbsp;paribus.<br><br>On the other hand, there are certain instances when the&nbsp;rise in wages is caused by factors which are independent&nbsp;of the forces of demand and supply. Firstly, if the&nbsp;government were to impose a minimum wage rate, then&nbsp;the price of labour would be increased artificially. As&nbsp;shown in the figure below, the market demand and&nbsp;supply of labour intersects at W<sub>0</sub>. However, the government&nbsp;imposes a minimum wage rate of W<sub>2</sub>, higher&nbsp;then the equilibrium wage. This causes the wage rate&nbsp;to rise artificially causing an excess supply of labour&nbsp;of q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub> at wage rate W<sub>2</sub>. Hence, the imposition of the&nbsp;minimum wage can cause wages to rise, independent&nbsp;of the forces of demand and supply.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/986b4acac7a692c6d7af785d4ab21701" alt="" width="340" height="221"><br><br>Also, the changing trend in receiving the reward for labour&nbsp;in an occupation can also cause the wage rate to rise.&nbsp;For example, if workers in the factory strictly desire to&nbsp;be fully paid or rewarded in monetary terms, the wage&nbsp;rate would be higher. This is because the firm need not&nbsp;compensate them by giving them medical benefits, transportation&nbsp;and tea breaks.<br><br>In conclusion, wage rates rise due to market forces when&nbsp;the demand for labour increases or the supply of labour&nbsp;falls. It can also rise due to factors such as the imposition&nbsp;of a minimum wage law or the change in the trend&nbsp;in preference of receiving the reward for one's labour;&nbsp;which are independent of the market forces of demand&nbsp;and supply.</li>
<li>It is usually assumed that a rise in wage rates will always&nbsp;lead to a fall in a firm's profits. This may be true in&nbsp;several occasions. However there are several instances&nbsp;when this does not apply. This essay aims to examine&nbsp;the impact of a wage rise on a firm's profits and the&nbsp;extent to which they may lead to a loss.<br>Firstly, if the rise in the wage rate is substantial and if&nbsp;labour costs constitute a large proportion of a company's&nbsp;total costs, the firm's profits may fall and it may even&nbsp;incur a loss, ceteris paribus. If the demand for labour&nbsp;is price inelastic as it is irreplaceable by any other factor&nbsp;of production such as machinery for instance, then the&nbsp;firm will have to bear the higher costs that the higher&nbsp;wages bring about.<br><br>As shown in the figure, a rise in wage costs from W<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>to W<sub>1</sub> will cause a less than proportionate fall in the&nbsp;quantity demanded for labour from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>. This is&nbsp;because the demand for labour is inelastic. The loss in&nbsp;profit due to the higher wage costs is greater than cost&nbsp;savings gained from the fall in the quantity demanded&nbsp;of labour. Hence, a substantial rise in wage rate, especially&nbsp;if demand for labour is price inelastic in&nbsp;demand, will cause a firm's profits to fall or even cost&nbsp;the firm to incur losses.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4cef3eca97f7b93b466c16cb9a8f24ec" alt="" width="333" height="177"><br><br>However, it is not always the case that a rise in wage&nbsp;costs will cause the firm's profits to decline as this is&nbsp;based on the assumption that all other factors remain&nbsp;constant. This may be true in theory but in the real&nbsp;world, more than one factor can change simultaneously.<br><br>For instance, if the wage rate were to increase but the&nbsp;productivity of the workers were to rise as well, then&nbsp;it would not cause the firm to incur losses. With a more&nbsp;productive labour force, the firm can produce more with&nbsp;the same quantity of workers. This will enable the firm&nbsp;to acquire more revenue. And if the total revenue gained&nbsp;from the more productive workforce can offset the rise&nbsp;in total costs due to higher wages, then the firm will&nbsp;not face the decline of its profits. For example, the&nbsp;wage rates of Singaporean workers are higher than the&nbsp;wages earned by other Asian counterparts. But there&nbsp;are still companies investing in Singapore as its workers&nbsp;are productive. The higher costs incurred due to&nbsp;higher wage costs are offset by the revenue earned by&nbsp;the more productive Singapore workers for they are&nbsp;able to do a myriad of tasks more efficiently then their&nbsp;Asian counterparts. Hence, profit levels can be maintained&nbsp;even if total costs are rising due to higher wage&nbsp;costs if the productivity of the worker increases at a&nbsp;faster rate, acquiring a higher amount of sales, revenue&nbsp;and total output.<br><br>Also, wages is not the only thing that a firm's total&nbsp;costs constitute of. A firm's total costs can include rent,&nbsp;insurance, transportation costs and other miscellaneous&nbsp;expenses on top of wage costs. Hence, if the firm is&nbsp;able to cut down other costs of production, it may still&nbsp;be able to maintain profit levels even with rising wage&nbsp;costs.<br><br>Finally, the demand for labour is a derived demand.&nbsp;This means that labour is demanded for the production&nbsp;of another good or service. If the demand for the final&nbsp;product is price inelastic in demand, such as rubbish&nbsp;collection, a rise in wage costs will not cause the firm's&nbsp;profits to decline. When wage costs rise, the cost of&nbsp;production will rise causing supply to fall and the price&nbsp;of the good to rise. As the good is price inelastic in&nbsp;demand, an increase in the price of the good will cause&nbsp;a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded of&nbsp;the good. Hence, a rise in wage costs will not result&nbsp;in the depletion of a firm's profits as the higher costs&nbsp;will be pushed onto the consumers as higher prices.<br><br>In conclusion, it is untrue that a rise in wage costs will&nbsp;always lead to a fall in profits earned as discussed above.</li>

<li>An oligopoly is a market structure where a few large&nbsp;firm dominate. The 5-firm market concentration ratio&nbsp;for oligopolies is high. It is also an imperfect market&nbsp;structure, closer to a monopoly, than to perfect competition.<br><br>There are two types of oligopoly, one is where there&nbsp;is only a few large firms in the market, while the other&nbsp;is where there are a lot of firms but only a few large&nbsp;ones dominate the market. The oligopolistic market is&nbsp;also characterised by high barriers to entry, which are&nbsp;restrictions that make it difficult for other firms to enter&nbsp;the market. High barriers to entry would include huge&nbsp;economies of scale, high fixed costs, control of raw&nbsp;materials and brand loyalty. <br><br>Economies of scale are&nbsp;cost savings the firm enjoys when it expands in size,&nbsp;and this makes it difficult for other firms to enter because&nbsp;they are less competitive to these already established&nbsp;oligopolies. High fixed costs involved also make it&nbsp;difficult for other firms to enter because they often start&nbsp;off small and are unable to bear the costs. Some oligopolies&nbsp;even control the supply of raw materials that&nbsp;other firms need, hence they will find it difficult to be&nbsp;part of the market. Lastly, brand loyalty can also be&nbsp;a barrier to entry because of the strong preference for&nbsp;a brand by the consumers.<br><br>Other features of an oligopoly are, there is mutual&nbsp;interdependence among firms, the products can be&nbsp;homogenous (steel and crude oil) or differentiated (cars&nbsp;and petrol) and there is price rigidity. Examples of&nbsp;oligopolies are steel mills, airlines, petrol, sports shoes&nbsp;and handphones.<br><br>Price and quantity in an oligopoly can be determined&nbsp;in three scenarios. Firstly, a few large companies have an&nbsp;equal share of the market and there is no brand loyalty.&nbsp;Hence, a kinked demand curve arises, which shows&nbsp;why there is price rigidity in such situations. The figure&nbsp;below illustrated this.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/89e425f364155d5e485c06a265230b26" alt="" width="290" height="154"><br><br>With reference to the figure, the top half of the demand&nbsp;curve is elastic while the bottom half is inelastic. An&nbsp;increase in price from the fixed price P<sub>0</sub> results in a&nbsp;more than proportionate fall in sales because customers&nbsp;to the other firms did not raise the price. Total revenue&nbsp;thus falls as a result of price increase. On the other&nbsp;hand, a reduction in price would result in a less than&nbsp;proportionate increase in sales, causing total revenue&nbsp;to also fall. This is because firms will follow price cuts&nbsp;but not price increases. There is thus price rigidity at&nbsp;P<sub>0</sub>.<br><br>Price is also determined in a cartel. This is formed&nbsp;when firms collude to form one large entity allowing&nbsp;them to reap economies of scale. This organisation will&nbsp;then decide on the price to be charged and quantity&nbsp;produced which would earn the most profits. Price&nbsp;competition is officially avoided. There is price rigidity.&nbsp;However, most countries ban the collusion of firms&nbsp;because they tend to jack up the price substantially and&nbsp;exploit the consumers to earn supernormal profits,&nbsp;behaving like monopolies. Consumers' welfare is thus&nbsp;not maximised.<br><br>As for large oligopoly firms with brand loyalty, firms&nbsp;do not have a kinked demand curve for their products.&nbsp;They have a high and very inelastic demand for each&nbsp;of the firms and by producing at the profit-maximising&nbsp;level, MC = MR, they will earn supernormal profits.&nbsp;This is illustrated in the figure below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a496697eab814682b412000636bf070a" alt="" width="297" height="154"><br><br>With reference to the figure, DD<sub>0</sub>, AC<sub>0</sub> and MR<sub>0</sub> are&nbsp;the original demand, average cost and marginal revenue&nbsp;curves. By producing where MC= MR and where&nbsp;the average cost is below the average revenue (DD<sub>0</sub>),&nbsp;the shaded area measures the supernormal profits earned.&nbsp;Finns gain by keeping prices high, rather than cutting&nbsp;them.<br><br>Brand loyalty can be considered as a barrier to trade&nbsp;because it makes it difficult for other firms to enter the&nbsp;industry and survive. Examples of oligopolies with brand&nbsp;loyalty are handphones - Nokia, Motorola and Samsung,&nbsp;and luxury airlines - Singapore Airlines and British&nbsp;Airways.<br><br>Lastly, price in oligopolies can be determined by a&nbsp;market leader which often owns more than 70% of the&nbsp;sales. When he cuts his price, it would benefit him as&nbsp;he can have more sales and he can replace the other&nbsp;smaller firms in the industry. Thus, they have to cut&nbsp;their prices too. The market leader will determine the&nbsp;price where profits are maximised. When the market&nbsp;leader raises his price, the smaller producers cannot&nbsp;replace his quantity. Therefore they might as well raise&nbsp;their prices too.<br><br>There is price rigidity in oligopolies, unlike in a competitive&nbsp;situation. In a competitive situation, prices are&nbsp;always going down so firms would remain competitive&nbsp;and they can maintain their sales. Not so for oligopoly&nbsp;situations.<br><br></li>
<li>In Singapore, as in many countries at the world level,&nbsp;there is a trend in oligopolies dominating more industries.&nbsp;Examples of such firms or industries are: petroleum&nbsp;companies, telecom service, bus and taxi transportation,&nbsp;handphones, banks, sports shoes and fast foods&nbsp;restaurants. The question is, why are industries moving&nbsp;towards the behaviour of oligopolies?<br><br>Firstly, there is intense competition locally, as well as&nbsp;globally among firms and industries. They compete to&nbsp;produce a better quality product or one that is unique,&nbsp;which can be done through research and development.&nbsp;Also, in order to remain competitive locally and globally,&nbsp;firms have to keep their prices low and to do&nbsp;this, their average cost has to be reduced through&nbsp;efficiency and productivity.<br><br>Oligopolistic firms also have a behaviour whereby their&nbsp;average cost keeps on falling as shown in the figure&nbsp;below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/40ed4110971fc6e6d9640286527fdfe2" alt="" width="318" height="157"><br><br>With reference to the figure, AC<sub>0</sub> and P<sub>0</sub> are the original&nbsp;average cost and price respectively. LRAC is the long&nbsp;run average cost curve.<br><br>When the average cost falls from AC<sub>0</sub> to AC<sub>1</sub>, prices&nbsp;can be cut to increase competitiveness and sales. The&nbsp;more the average cost falls, the more the price can fall.&nbsp;Hence, it is apparent in today's world, especially in&nbsp;oligopolies that prices of their goods and services are&nbsp;falling. For the average cost to fall, economies of scale&nbsp;are needed.<br><br>Economies of scale (EOS) are cost benefits that firms enjoy&nbsp;when they expand in size. To keep prices down, oligopolies&nbsp;have to reap EOS which would reduce their&nbsp;average cost, followed by a reduction in price. EOS&nbsp;includes managerial and financial economies scale. The&nbsp;former would mean that firms who employ qualified&nbsp;people such as professional managers to run the business,&nbsp;can achieve efficiency. As for the latter, larger&nbsp;firms are in a better position to borrow money on more&nbsp;favourable terms from banks whenever they lack funds.<br><br>There is also a need for product development, which&nbsp;can be done through research and development. This&nbsp;is essential in today's expanding oligopolistic sector in&nbsp;the world today because customers are being more&nbsp;environment-conscious. They demand environmentally friendly&nbsp;products which are pollution free and waste&nbsp;free. Also, they could demand for healthier products&nbsp;like for example, fast food restaurants such as&nbsp;MacDonalds and Burger King are competing by producing&nbsp;healthier food. Therefore, there is a need for&nbsp;product development. The point is, large firms in an&nbsp;oligopoly have the resources to undertake research;&nbsp;product development and exploit all the EOS. Small&nbsp;firms do not. As a result, they cannot compete and eventually, close down.<br><br>Lastly, consumers nowadays are very brand conscious.&nbsp;For example in the sport shoe industry, people would&nbsp;go for Nike, Adidas, Reebok and Converse. This makes&nbsp;their products very demand inelastic which enable them&nbsp;to jack up the price of their products substantially and&nbsp;still receive paying customers. These firms will then&nbsp;earn supernormal profits which allow firms to undertake&nbsp;research and development to produce better quality&nbsp;products.<br><br>However, oligopolies are not the only market structure&nbsp;that exist in Singapore. There are also perfect competition,&nbsp;monopolistic competition and monopolies. The&nbsp;following are their features and the reasons of their&nbsp;existence.<br><br>Perfect competition is one where there are many buyers&nbsp;and sellers, hence there is no price setter, but a price&nbsp;taker. Its products are homogeneous, there is perfect&nbsp;knowledge and there are no barriers to entry. Examples&nbsp;of perfect competition are the durian sellers along&nbsp;Geylang Road in Singapore, photocopying businesses&nbsp;and money changers. In these industries, there is no&nbsp;scope for product differentiation.<br><br>Monopolistic competition is similar to perfect competition,&nbsp;except their products are differentiated. There&nbsp;are low barriers to entry, allowing firms to make only&nbsp;normal profits in the long run, just like in perfect&nbsp;competition where firms are only able to reap normal&nbsp;profits in the long run. Examples of monopolistic&nbsp;competition would be the coffee shop, cake shops,&nbsp;barbers, hair saloons and ladies dresses.<br><br>The reasons for perfect and monopolistic competition&nbsp;are freedom of entry and exit, low start-up, perfect&nbsp;knowledge and their variety of products. Firms in these&nbsp;two market structures move in and out of the industry&nbsp;in relation to profits earned. Low start-up cost and&nbsp;perfect knowledge of the business enable entrepreneurs&nbsp;to set up businesses easily in the industry, thus such&nbsp;market structures still persist. Lastly, consumers nowadays&nbsp;demand for differentiated goods - they want&nbsp;variety. Since these firms are small, they are able to&nbsp;produce unique products.<br><br>Lastly, monopolies such as the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit)&nbsp;and PUB (Public Utilities Board) still exist because&nbsp;they are natural monopolies. More than one of theses&nbsp;natural monopolies would be a waste of resources. Their&nbsp;fixed costs are extremely high. They are able to produce&nbsp;a huge output and attain a much lower cost, as&nbsp;compared to having many small firms. Hence, these&nbsp;natural monopolies will still exist.</li>

<li>Interest is the cost of using money. When one spends&nbsp;his money, he foregoes interest. When one borrows he&nbsp;has to pay interest. The Keynesian Liquidity preference&nbsp;theory of interest states that "interest is the reward for&nbsp;parting with liquidity for a specified period." Keynesian&nbsp;emphasized that the demand for money was not related&nbsp;solely to the demand for new capital goods and supply&nbsp;of funds was not dependently solely on the current level&nbsp;of saving. He pointed out that money was demanded&nbsp;not simply because it was a medium of exchange, it&nbsp;was also in demand as an asset. When he spoke of&nbsp;"demand for money", Keynesian was referring to a&nbsp;demand to hold money. This preference for money over&nbsp;other kinds of assets is known as liquidity preference.<br><br>There are three motives for holding money. First is the&nbsp;transaction motive. The amount of money held as&nbsp;transaction balances depend on the level of income, the&nbsp;movements in prices of goods and services, and the&nbsp;frequency with which income payments are made. If&nbsp;our income rises, we tend to buy more and better goods&nbsp;and services. Therefore we will hold larger transaction&nbsp;balances. If prices rise, we would hold larger cash&nbsp;balances because the things we buy now costs more.&nbsp;The frequency with which income is paid also has an&nbsp;important influence on the size of the average transaction&nbsp;balance.<br><br>Second is the precautionary motive. It refers to the desire&nbsp;to hold cash balances in order to meet expenditures&nbsp;which may arise due to unforeseen circumstances such&nbsp;as sicknesses and accidents. The demand to hold cash&nbsp;for precautionary motive varies directly with income.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/88db1ffd64824fd879fd1ed9a7e0e142" alt="" width="335" height="166"><br><br>The transaction and precaution demands are not affected&nbsp;by interest level.<br><br>Third is the speculative motive. Any money which is&nbsp;held in excess of the requirements outlines above must&nbsp;be held for speculative motives. People holding money&nbsp;in excess of the amounts needed for transactions and&nbsp;precautionary purposes must be convinced that, for the&nbsp;time being, it is more rewarding to hold money than&nbsp;financial or real income earning assets. People will prefer&nbsp;to hold money rather than securities when interest rates&nbsp;are low. At lower interest rates, less will be lost by not&nbsp;lending money or investing it. The reverse is true for&nbsp;higher interest rates.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/bd97f5343f81c5340a4a7feefae178a7" alt="" width="325" height="166"><br><br>According to Keynesian theory, the supply of money&nbsp;is determined by the monetary authorities and can be taken&nbsp;as fixed in the short run. The total supply of&nbsp;money in an economy consists of notes, coins and bank&nbsp;deposits. The Central Bank is the sole note issuing&nbsp;authority. It issues notes and coins. The commercial&nbsp;banking systems exercises through credit creation,&nbsp;considerable influence on the quantity of money available&nbsp;in the economy. But the total money supply is&nbsp;subject to government control. It is thus assumed to be&nbsp;fixed in the short run.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5cb7f78b299c505b2b64ef808e79a521" alt="" width="348" height="212"><br><br>Liquidity preference (LP) is the demand curve for cash&nbsp;balances. The vertical supply curve is the supply&nbsp;curve for a given quantity of money in the country.&nbsp;The intersection of the two curves determine the rate&nbsp;of interest.<br><br>In recent years, the interest rates in most developed&nbsp;countries have been low for two reasons. Supply of&nbsp;money has been plentiful；the worlds economy has not&nbsp;been doing too well. Governments in these countries&nbsp;have adopted expansionary monetary measures. In Japan&nbsp;interest is near zero. The demand for money has been&nbsp;low because of the uncertainties, bad expectations and&nbsp;crisis have hit the world economy, one after another.<br><br>The Asian Financial crisis hit in 1997. Then came Sept&nbsp;11, 2001. Then SARS in 2002; followed by the Iraq&nbsp;war, bird flu, war, tsunami, Katrina, earth quakes and&nbsp;so forth. All these dampened spending levels. Thus&nbsp;supply of money outstripped demand; keeping interest&nbsp;rates very low.</li>
<li>The effects of a fall in interest rates will affect Singapore&nbsp;in the following ways:<br><br>Investments will increase. Interest rate is the cost of&nbsp;borrowing money for investment. Generally if the&nbsp;interest rate is high, entrepreneurs demand a lesser&nbsp;amount of capital fund for investment as the rate of&nbsp;profit earned may not be sufficient to cover the interest&nbsp;cost. If the interest is low, investment projects which&nbsp;have been unworkable become profitable and hence&nbsp;entrepreneurs will demand a greater amount of capital&nbsp;fund. This is because investment (I) is a function of&nbsp;the rate of interest, i.e. I= f(i).<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5a324110cbd66dd0e1fd40c98b7b169f" alt="" width="508" height="183"><br><br>Increased money supply causes interest to fall; causing&nbsp;investments to increase.<br><br>Given that rate of interest has fallen, say from r<sub>0</sub> to&nbsp;r<sub>1</sub>, which is now the new equilibrium level, there will&nbsp;be a greater demand for capital. However, present&nbsp;changes in interest rate are not sufficient to influence&nbsp;the level of interest decisions. Investment decisions&nbsp;depend on the expected rate of profits or Marginal&nbsp;Efficiency of Investment (MEI). It is also referred to&nbsp;as Marginal Efficiency of Capital (MEC). MEI is defined&nbsp;as the relationship between the prospective yield of one&nbsp;more unit of investment, and the cost of obtaining it.&nbsp;If it is likely to be less than the rate of interest, investment&nbsp;will be discouraged. On the other hand, if the&nbsp;MEI is expected to be greater than the rate of interest,&nbsp;investment will be undertaken. For example, when&nbsp;interest rate is low during deflation, investment will be&nbsp;discouraged due to the even lower MEI.<br><br>Regardless of the present changes in the interest rate,&nbsp;if future prices of products are expected to be rising,&nbsp;the profit margins will also tend to rise. Taking an optimistic&nbsp;view of the future, the businessman will wish&nbsp;to increase their investment. But if future prices are&nbsp;expected to fall, pessimism regarding the future prices&nbsp;will discourage businessman to invest.<br><br>Investment decisions can also be influenced by a&nbsp;country's political stability and its government policy.&nbsp;Without the integrity and efficiency of the government,&nbsp;no matter how the interest rate is, businessman will not&nbsp;invest.<br><br>As Singapore is a financial center in the region, a lower&nbsp;interest depreciates the currency. This is because "hot&nbsp;money" or speculative funds will flow out of Singapore.&nbsp;The selling off of Sing $ will cause it to fall. A weaker&nbsp;currency, in the short term, will cause inflation.&nbsp;Singapore imports a lot. All of these consumer goods&nbsp;and petroleum will cost more. The weaker currency&nbsp;will also increase export demand. More foreign visitors&nbsp;will visit Singapore. In all these will have inflationary&nbsp;trends.<br><br>If the interest stays low, the currency will stay low, which will improve Singapore's trade competitiveness. In&nbsp;all, export demand will increase; leading to more income&nbsp;and employment; and a higher living standard.&nbsp;A weaker economy also makes it easier for foreign&nbsp;MNCs to invest in Singapore. They use Singapore as&nbsp;an export base for the region, again, generating more income and&nbsp;employment.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f1131137f3901b8104f13217fb5c5b85" alt="" width="359" height="160"><br><br>With a lower interest, consumptions, investments&nbsp;and export rise; causing national&nbsp;income to increase from Y<sub>c</sub> to Y<sub>1</sub>.<br><br>Overall, a lower interest rate due to&nbsp;greater money supply will be good for&nbsp;the country.</li>

The diagram below shows&nbsp;the level of economic activity over a period of time.<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7dc68bf79d70fdf0132d4b9655da28dc" alt="" width="311" height="128"><br>The period ab and cd shows a down tum in economic activity&nbsp;which usually last for a number of years. The graph beyond&nbsp;b and beyond d is called the up-tum when business activity&nbsp;picks up.<br>No one really knows what causes a recession, but it is part&nbsp;of the trade cycle that inflicts all market or mixed economies.&nbsp;It has largely to do with expectations. When people,&nbsp;producers and consumers feel that prices are at a peak, and&nbsp;therefore may fall, they postponed expenditure. Thus demand&nbsp;and supply move in a downward left direction. The&nbsp;cycle becomes: fall in demand&nbsp;→ fall in price&nbsp;→ fall in&nbsp;supply → fall in income&nbsp;→ fall in demand, and the whole&nbsp;cycle repeats itself.<br>A recession is characterized by falling price of major assets&nbsp;such as shares, homes, land and other properties. Even if&nbsp;prices are not falling, they are not rising or rising at a very&nbsp;slow rate. An inflation rate of zero or not more than 1%&nbsp;is a characteristic of a recession in most developed countries.<br>Falling incomes result in falling consumptions, although&nbsp;people try to save whatever they can. The fall in savings&nbsp;may cause interest rates to rise which in tum discourages&nbsp;investments. As investments fall due to the lack in demand&nbsp;and high interest rates, the economy's growth rate slows&nbsp;down. Some developed economies have even had a negative&nbsp;growth rate.<br>Lastly a recession may put a severe strain on government&nbsp;budgets. The army of unemployed have to be fed by way&nbsp;of benefit payments. Government expenditure on projects&nbsp;and other obligations have to be kept so as not to cause&nbsp;incomes and demand to fall further. On the other hand, the&nbsp;falling incomes and profits of companies lead to a fall in&nbsp;tax revenues. This phenomena cause the government to run&nbsp;a budget deficit and often it is a large deficit.<br>The Singapore government can adopt a Keynesian solution:<br>Keynesian's solution is called the multiplier process. A large&nbsp;increase in government spending will lead to an increase&nbsp;in output. Increasing output can only come about with more&nbsp;workers and resources being employed. The value of the&nbsp;multiplier is 'k'.<br>The underlying argument in Keynesian's economics is that&nbsp;an autonomous increase in aggregate demand (AD) may&nbsp;lead to a multiple or to a more than proportionate increase&nbsp;in income (output). The rise in AD is also called an injection,&nbsp;which can be investments, public spending, exports&nbsp;and even autonomous consumption. For an example, if&nbsp;investments increase by $10m, the national income may rise&nbsp;by $30m. In this case, the value of k is 3.<br>To illustrate the k process we shall assume the following.&nbsp;Firstly, Singapore is a 4-sector economy with the household,&nbsp;producers and government and foreign trade sectors.&nbsp;Secondly, there are unemployed resources in the country.&nbsp;Thirdly, the marginal propensity to save (mps) is 0.2, the&nbsp;marginal propensity to tax (mpt) is 0.2 and the marginal&nbsp;propensity to import (mpm) is 0.1. This means that every&nbsp;time someone earns an additional income of $100, he will&nbsp;save $20, pay tax of $20 and buy imports of $10. He will&nbsp;only spend $50 on locally produced goods. Fourthly, the&nbsp;economy is in equilibrium meaning that output is not fluctuating.&nbsp;Lastly the government decides to spend $200m on&nbsp;a public project.<br>The government's expenditure of $200m serves as an injection&nbsp;to the economy. It will cause a multiple increase in&nbsp;output and employment. This process is shown in the table&nbsp;below.</p>

<p>In round 1, the economy produces output worth $200m&nbsp;because of government expenditure. Of this income $40m&nbsp;is saved by the economy, $40m is taxed away and $20m&nbsp;is spent on imports. Expenditure in the second round rises&nbsp;by $100m and the process repeats itself.<br>The multiplier process can be summarized as:<br>ΔY = k&nbsp;× ΔJ = 2 × 200m = $400m<br>where k = 1/(mpm + mpt + mps)<br>The value of k is 1/(0.2+0.1+0.2) = 2<br>Graphically the k process can be shown as:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7656634d20617f33e83cde2372eb5be9" alt="" width="367" height="168"><br>Government spending raises from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>. The economy&nbsp;grows from Y<sub>e1</sub> to Y<sub>e2</sub>. Thus more employment has been&nbsp;created.<br>However getting out of a recession may not be this simple.&nbsp;Firstly, as explained, a recession prevails because of negative&nbsp;expectations. People, consumers and producers believe&nbsp;that times are going to get worse. Demand is going to fall&nbsp;further leading to more stocks accumulation and more&nbsp;retrenchment. Thus they would save even more to last out&nbsp;the bad times. The increase in money supply, brought about&nbsp;by the government's expansionary policies is, therefore,&nbsp;simply, 'leaked' away.<br>Leakages may also come in the form of imports and the&nbsp;export of capital. The former is unlikely but the latter happens&nbsp;because the rich seeks their fortunes in other countries where&nbsp;economies are still booming.<br>In order to bring its economy out of a recession, the&nbsp;Singapore government has to ensure that conditions are&nbsp;favourable. The government would have to block all leakages.&nbsp;This can be done by reassuring the public, that the&nbsp;economy is picking up. Publishing economic indicators would&nbsp;convince the business class of rising demand. The government&nbsp;may have to ban the export of capital.<br>Production may not be able to expand if the infrastructure&nbsp;of the economy has deteriorated or if there are still labour&nbsp;management problems. The government would have to&nbsp;remove all such bottlenecks by intervening directly into the&nbsp;market.<br>Perhaps a more serious problem facing the government is&nbsp;the financing of a budget deficit. How is the government&nbsp;going to spend more than it collects? It will have to borrow&nbsp;which will be difficult domestically (incomes have already&nbsp;fallen). If it borrows externally, it has been argued that the&nbsp;recession is only being postponed to a later date. This is&nbsp;because the government would have to pay back even more&nbsp;in the future. The future increases in taxes and reduction&nbsp;in expenditure may bring back the recession.<br>Lastly, eradicating a recession in Singapore is made even&nbsp;more difficult because our leakages are extremely high.&nbsp;Singapore is a very small country that has to import most&nbsp;of its needs. It is a trading country. Specialisation and high&nbsp;exports keep the economy strong. Therefore, Singapore simply&nbsp;has to "wait out" a recession. When the world economy&nbsp;picks up, Singapore picks up with it.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 271</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8582</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why pollution and congestion caused by cars&nbsp;are likely to cause market failure.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Market failure can occur because of negative externalities. These are costs that fall on society in general due&nbsp;to activities of certain producers and consumers. They&nbsp;are also called spillover effects or third part effects&nbsp;which are bad. These cost cannot be quantified; that&nbsp;is measured in dollars. External cost (negative externalities) and&nbsp;private cost make up social cost (SC = PC + EC).</p>
<p>Pollution and traffic congestion is caused by private car&nbsp;driving. It occurs when people use the limited road&nbsp;space more than they should. What is the cause of this?&nbsp;It is consumption behavior and the existence of external&nbsp;cost or negative externality arising from car driving.&nbsp;The car also gives off too much exhaust. It uses&nbsp;fossil fuel like petrol and diesel. The exhaust gases&nbsp;include carbon monoxide which is harmful.</p>
<p>A rational individual will consume up to a point where&nbsp;the total utility he derives is maximized for every additional&nbsp;dollar he spends on the good. In economics,&nbsp;nothing is free; there must be a price for everything.&nbsp;Price is an indicator of value and opportunity cost. The&nbsp;higher the price, the higher the value society attaches&nbsp;to the good, and also the scarcer the good.</p>
<p>For a good which is available to an individual at zero&nbsp;price, the marginal utility of consumption for that good&nbsp;declines with greater consumption. He will consume up&nbsp;to a point where the marginal utility of consumption&nbsp;for that good is zero. Since he does not need to spend&nbsp;a single cent on this good, the latter, as a result, is not&nbsp;valuable to him. He will not get extra satisfaction from&nbsp;additional consumption of this good (once the MU is&nbsp;zero).</p>
<p>Urban traffic congestion and pollution is the result of&nbsp;inefficient allocation of resources by car buyers and&nbsp;sellers. The price signal sent to the market is not effective&nbsp;enough to reflect how many cars should be allowed to&nbsp;run on the roads in the country, to the extent that it&nbsp;leads to road congestion. What then are the imperfections&nbsp;in the car market that lead to road congestion?</p>
<p>The bulk of cost of car ownership and driving are fixed&nbsp;costs - depreciation, the road tax and insurance. Usage&nbsp;cost is only petrol which is low. Thus every additional&nbsp;trip is close to zero cost. In fact the higher fixed cost&nbsp;encourages more usage of road space; as these are&nbsp;already paid for. However, in using the road space, the&nbsp;consumer does not consider the non-monetary cost of&nbsp;congestion: other consumers and producers are not able&nbsp;to travel efficiently. Time is wasted. National production&nbsp;levels fall. People's welfare suffer due to the strain&nbsp;of being in a traffic jam.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c4c5d2a3dd645238bd868ea72e175b07" alt="" width="369" height="172"></p>
<p>Car driving is at Oq<sub>1</sub> because the consumer maximizes&nbsp;his utility where PMC = PMS. However society wants&nbsp;car driving to be at Oq<sub>2</sub>, where SMC = PMB. The&nbsp;shaded areas shows welfare loss to society. Therefore&nbsp;traffic congestion is market failure.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the above discussion is&nbsp;in the context of a pure market, free enterprise economy&nbsp;where the government does not get involved in resource&nbsp;allocation. Therefore private consumers and producers&nbsp;make decisions only on the basis for their own private&nbsp;costs and benefits. They are not compelled to consider&nbsp;negative or positive externalities. In fact very often,&nbsp;they fail to even recognize that externalities exist.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 272</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8581</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss how a fall in market demand for hotel accommodation&nbsp;is likely to affect both a 5-star luxury hotel&nbsp;and other types of hotel.</p>

<p>Initially, the Demand was at D<sub>0</sub>, and the firm was&nbsp;operating at q<sub>0</sub> (on SRAC<sub>0</sub>). Due to bad times the demand&nbsp;falls to D<sub>1</sub>. The range of revenue anywhere on this&nbsp;demand curve is below the total cost of the firm which&nbsp;is still at Oq<sub>0</sub> at SRAC. Note that bulk of costs for a&nbsp;luxury hotel is fixed costs. Again; to illustrate the point:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/7a46932c6d15653e13d09307d66b8155" alt="" width="345" height="187"><br><br>The hotel makes profit in situation TR<sub>1</sub> (good times).&nbsp;In bad times; TR falls drastically and thus losses are&nbsp;incurred. The cost structure of the luxury hotel is rigid.</p>
<p>In the case of budget hotels, they too make losses but&nbsp;not as severe. This is because they have much lower&nbsp;fixed costs and are more flexible in their cost structures.&nbsp;Therefore, when demand falls, the drop in revenue&nbsp;may still be just above cost or slightly below it.&nbsp;Smaller firms may also reduce costs because a lot of&nbsp;their operations and tasks are subcontracted out. They&nbsp;buy complementary services from other firms and many&nbsp;of their employees are part timers or on contract. Therefore&nbsp;they are in a better situation to make the best of&nbsp;the bad situation.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/1504cfbe208faa17752081d2e036cb4a" alt="" width="330" height="152"></p>
<p>Initially revenue covers cost (TR<sub>1</sub> &gt; TC<sub>1</sub>); then revenue&nbsp;falls to TR<sub>2</sub>; causing a loss (TC<sub>1</sub> &gt; TR<sub>2</sub>). But the cost&nbsp;cutting measures of the small firms; brings TC down&nbsp;to TC<sub>2</sub>; which still allows a small profit to be made.&nbsp;In fact; during bad times, the demand and revenue of&nbsp;smaller firms may even rise; giving even more profits!&nbsp;This is because regular travelers may downgrade from&nbsp;luxury hotels to budget hotels. This is done to cut their&nbsp;own cost.<br>In the long term, all businesses become more flexible.&nbsp;A luxury hotel can restructure its costs. If the down&nbsp;tum is seen to be long term, then they can let workers&nbsp;go; they can cut the number of buildings and even sell&nbsp;off some facilities. Therefore they too can cut their&nbsp;losses and break into the black again.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/573d76b9891d866eb82437e02d8ac9e5" alt="" width="383" height="171"></p>
<p>By cutting long term costs; the SRAC shifts to SRAC<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;on the LRAC. In this way some profits can be made&nbsp;because the lower demand D<sub>1</sub> is still higher than the&nbsp;cost of operation.</p>
<p>The benefits of being a larger firm are always there.&nbsp;But larger firms take a longer time to adjust to changing&nbsp;business climate.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 273</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8580</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the type of market structure in which each of&nbsp;the following is likely to operate:</p>

<li>Monopolistic competition is a market structure in&nbsp;which there are many sellers but in which each&nbsp;firm has some control over the price of its product.&nbsp;Firms sell a differentiated product within a narrow&nbsp;price band.<br><br>Why is a hawker food stall an appropriate example&nbsp;of a monopolistic competition? It is due to the&nbsp;following characteristics of a monopolistic competition:<br>There is a large number of firms. There are many&nbsp;firms in the industry. As a result, none of them&nbsp;is large enough to dominate the industry. Consider&nbsp;the number of barbershops, drugstores, drycleaners,&nbsp;restaurants and newsstands that are found in&nbsp;a typical large city. Likewise hawker food stalls&nbsp;is an example of monopolistic competition.<br><br>Secondly, there is product differentiation where each product is slightly different from those in the industry, so that each firm has a slightly downward sloping demand curve (less inelastic as compared to a monopoly). The differences in product may be real or imaginary. The main thing is that buyers do not regard them as identical. Because of product differentiation, each firm is able to carve out a share of the market for themselves. If each were to increase its price, each would not lose all its customers unlike perfect competition. The firm also uses the price and output policy as a monopolist. This is the "monopolistic" aspect of monopolistic competition. Equilibrium output is where MC = MR. As hawker food stall shops are located in the various neighbourhoods and shopping centres, customers will patronize the respective shops because of convenience and product differentiation in terms of better presentation and more delicious food.<br><br>The third feature is that there is freedom of entry and exit of the firm in the industry in the long run. This is the "competitive" aspect of monopolistic competition. This also means that each firm will only make normal profit in the long run just as in the case of the competitive firm. The entry and exit of hawker food stall is free and this reveals the characteristics of monopolistic competition. Price wars or undercutting is the main form of competition.<br><br>Also there is non-price competttion. Since each firm produces a similar but somewhat different product from every other firm in the industry, as to emphasize the difference in order to increase sales. This is known as non-price competition. This takes many forms. "Service with a smile" or "Buy $20 of food and get an icecream cone free" are common examples. Advertising in local newspapers, shopper's guide and other media outlets is common. As for hawker food stalls, better services can be provided to customers and a bigger helping can be given to attract customers.<br><br>Below is a diagram of a firm in monopolistic competition; making normal profits in the long run:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/08f4d9e3a5c4819ed26875b5a42ef318" alt="" width="317" height="119"></li>
<li>To explain why luxury hotels is an appropriate&nbsp;example of oligopoly, the following characteristics of oligopoly are discussed.<br>There are only a few firms in the industry competing with one another. Sellers realise that they are mutually dependent. Oligopoly is relatively important in manufacturing industries such as car manufacturing, detergents industries, television sets, and petroleum products. Therefore since there are a few luxury hotels in the industry, it is an oligopoly.<br><br>Secondly, the product may be homogenous or differentiated. In perfect or pure oligopoly, the few firms produce homogenous product. In imperfect or differentiated oligopoly, there is product differentiation through the use of brand names and trademarks. In the case of the luxury hotel industry, products are differentiated in the use of brand names or trademarks.<br><br>There is existence of barriers to entry. This arises because of economies of scale, product recognition, product complexity and product proliferation. Hence the luxury hotel industry possesses the characteristics&nbsp;of oligopoly. Luxury hotel requires heavy initial capital investment. This serves as a barrier to entry for other firms. Besides this financial obstacle, an important deterrent to new comers is that the technology of some industries make the most economical scale of operation so large that the most efficient firms are the big producers supplying a large fraction of the industrial output. New firms usually start off with a small share of the market and this would thus make it difficult&nbsp;for them to establish themselves especially when the large firms are able to exploit economies of scale.<br><br>Also there are effects of non-price competitions.&nbsp;There is non-price competition (advertising, different packaging, better services, free gifts) and price rigidity because the actions and decisions of one firm will affect the other firms, a common price is often tacitly agreed upon by all firms in the industry. Luxury hotel is an appropriate example of an oligopoly in this case.<br><br>Below is a diagram of a firm in oligopoly with a kinked demand curve, making super-normal profits:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5dad5333d29e570cf4dcf58ca4d26730" alt="" width="301" height="141"></li>

The&nbsp;responsiveness of demand refers to the relative or proportionate&nbsp;change in demand, not the absolute change. For&nbsp;example, when the price of good X decreases, Mr A increases&nbsp;his purchases from 2 to 4 while Mr B increases his&nbsp;from 100 to 120. Mr A is more responsive to price changes&nbsp;than Mr B although the absolute change is much greater&nbsp;for Mr B.</p>
<p>The price elasticity of demand (PED) is a ratio which&nbsp;measures the responsiveness of demand due to a change in&nbsp;the price of a good. For a straight line demand curve, the</p>
<p>formula PED = (% change in quantity demanded of the good)/(% change in the pnce of good) can be used. The PED value is usually negative and this&nbsp;is shown in the diagram.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a45a1e2ebe6859e17ed0a9abd241057e" alt="" width="317" height="145"><br><br>The downward sloping demand curve means that there is&nbsp;an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded&nbsp;of a good. As price rises, quantity decreases, and vice versa.&nbsp;However, there are some exceptional cases where PED is&nbsp;positive.<br>The magnitude of the value of the PED is independent of&nbsp;the sign. It is based solely on the degree of responsiveness&nbsp;of demand. There are five different degrees of elasticity,&nbsp;namely elastic, inelastic, perfectly elastic, perfectly inelastic&nbsp;and unitary.<br>The magnitude of the value of the PED depends on many&nbsp;factors. The proportion of the income spent on the good is&nbsp;one. If a large proportion of the total income is spent on&nbsp;the good, then it is price inelastic. Other factors are the&nbsp;nature of the good and the availability of substitutes.<br>The income elasticity of demand is a ratio which measures&nbsp;the responsiveness of demand due to a change in the income&nbsp;of consumers. For straight line demand curve, the formula<br>YED=(% change in quantity demanded of the good)/(% change in income) can be&nbsp;used.<br>The YED can be either positive or negative, and a positive&nbsp;income consumption curve (ICC) is shown below for illustration.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/dc8ed6daa443e540a58a06cda2bfe26d" alt="" width="313" height="125"><br><br>If the ICC is positive as shown above, then there is a direct&nbsp;relationship between income and quantity demanded. This&nbsp;means that as income increases, quantity demanded also&nbsp;increases. Such goods are called normal goods. If the ICC&nbsp;is negative, then there is an inverse relationship between&nbsp;income and quantity demanded, and the good is an inferior&nbsp;good. A negative ICC is shown below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/2cf21f0cf724c9f27d3c6258c7d15d26" alt="" width="317" height="125"><br><br>For YED, the degrees are the same as that of PED. Thus&nbsp;the magnitude of the value of the YED is independent of&nbsp;the sign. The concept of normal and inferior good is a&nbsp;phenomenon experienced by those of the upper income&nbsp;group. For those in the lower and middle incomes, there&nbsp;is usually only normal goods.<br>In international trade, one has to buy foreign currency to&nbsp;pay for imports. Therefore when a country's currency&nbsp;depreciates against other currencies, its export becomes&nbsp;cheaper. The country can expect an export Jed boost leading&nbsp;to more income and employment.<br>When the Sing $ falls,&nbsp; the exports price in US$ fall as well.&nbsp;For example if item A cost S$200 in Singapore, it will cost&nbsp;US$133.33 in the world if the exchange rate were S$1.5&nbsp;= US$ 1. However when the Sing $ falls to S$2 = US$1,&nbsp;then the item will cost US$100 in the world market.<br>With an elastic demand curve for Singapore exports, the&nbsp;Singapore economy will sell more quantities of exports&nbsp;overseas and earn more at the same time.<br>The quantity increases from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>. The total revenue also&nbsp;increases as shown.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/aa7ff3d1b7fc864434313562f5c6b7f1" alt="" width="318" height="126"><br><br>Assuming import expenditure remain constant, the balance&nbsp;of payments on current account will improve. This acts as&nbsp;an injection into the Singapore circular flow of income.&nbsp;Through the multiplier process, it will create more income&nbsp;and employment.<br>World economic growth is interpreted as increase in income&nbsp;in other countries - especially the developed countries of&nbsp;Europe and America. For most countries, foreign goods and&nbsp;services are treated as normal goods. This is due to their&nbsp;novelty. Therefore the rise in incomes in these countries&nbsp;will lead to an increased demand for Singapore exports.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b5921680bb6b28f219cf3e0a16b8b86f" alt="" width="328" height="129"><br><br>The income increases worldwide will also lead to more&nbsp;demand for Singapore-made goods. Therefore Singapore will&nbsp;enjoy an increase in export of finished goods. These earnings&nbsp;trigger off the multiplier process leading to greater output&nbsp;and employment.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5dd7d49a52fa484ba07d560e8cc3d2d8" alt="" width="316" height="142"><br><br>Increased exports cause the AD to rise from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;This causes income to increase by Y<sub>c0</sub> Y <sub>c1</sub>.<br>A fall in the external value of a country's currency, either&nbsp;due to a devaluation or depreciation, can have good or&nbsp;negative effects on its economy.<br>Firstly, a fall may worsen the country's balance of payments&nbsp;in the short-term. This is because the demand for exports&nbsp;and imports in the immediate or short term period would&nbsp;be inelastic. Thus, with only a slight increase in exports,&nbsp;the country suffers a net fall in export earnings due to a&nbsp;more significant fall in the foreign price of its goods. On&nbsp;the other hand, imports become dearer because of the&nbsp;appreciated foreign currency. Thus the gain made in buying&nbsp;slightly less imports is offset by the increased payments due&nbsp;to higher local price for foreign goods. This is called the&nbsp;J-curve effect as shown below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/652474f5cf275238603e3179e18e7885" alt="" width="304" height="131"><br><br>The current account worsens at the initial stages. Assuming&nbsp;that the country was in a deficit at (a), a fall in the currency&nbsp;causes the deficit to worsen to (b) because the export earnings&nbsp;fall and import expenses rise. If the country was with a&nbsp;surplus, then such a change would cause the surplus to get&nbsp;smaller.<br>In the long run, devaluation may improve&nbsp;the balance of payments. This is because demand for exports&nbsp;and imports would be elastic then. Thus a cheaper&nbsp;local dollar attracts more foreign buyers and dearer foreign&nbsp;currencies, discourage imports. The increases and falls in&nbsp;purchases offsets the change in real prices of exports and&nbsp;imports. Thus the balance of payments, if a deficit, causes&nbsp;it to get smaller, and if a surplus causes it to grow.<br>A growing balance of payments surplus may have the&nbsp;following effects on the currency. The increased export&nbsp;earnings serve as an injection into the domestic circular&nbsp;flow of income. Through the multiplier it generates more&nbsp;income. Consumption and savings increase. Interest rates&nbsp;fall. Investment increases giving the economy another push.&nbsp;Employment of resources increases and the country enjoys&nbsp;a higher standard of living. A falling surplus would slow&nbsp;down this process. However the above can only be true if&nbsp;there were unemployed resources in the country. If the&nbsp;economy was already at full employment level of income,&nbsp;such an effect would probably lead to inflation.<br>If one assumes that demand for exports and imports remain&nbsp;inelastic, even in the long-run, then a current deficit will&nbsp;grow.<br>A deficit in the balance of payment of a country would&nbsp;lower living standards. A growing deficit would be a bigger&nbsp;leakage. The multiplier works in reverse gear. Income,&nbsp;consumption, savings and employment worsen. Thus if a&nbsp;weaker Sing $ worsened the balance, the above results.<br>A falling currency in the world market can also lead to&nbsp;domestic inflation. If the country is dependant on certain&nbsp;essential imports of which it buys in huge quantities, the&nbsp;fall may lead to a higher cost of living. Singapore buys&nbsp;100% of its petroleum from overseas. A falling S$ will&nbsp;definitely cause us to pay more. The prices of all other&nbsp;goods and services would have to rise.<br>Lastly, a falling currency may cause an outflow of 'hot'&nbsp;money from the country. Speculators and businessmen lose&nbsp;confidence in the economy. Demand for the currency falls,&nbsp;causing the value to fall even further. The outflow of capital&nbsp;causes the capital account to worsen. With less money,&nbsp;interest rates in the country may rise. If all else remains&nbsp;constant, investments fall and this may, again, slow down&nbsp;economic growth.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 275</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8567</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the view that monetary policy is the best method&nbsp;of controlling inflation in an economy.</p>

<p>A contractionary monetary policy has the same effect&nbsp;in reducing AD. When money supply is reduced, interest&nbsp;rates rise and this reduces the amount of credit&nbsp;in the economy, as borrowing become more expensive.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e28604b443833b3861087fa6871f7e88" alt="" width="309" height="168"><br><br>However in the short term, this contractionary MP policy&nbsp;can actually worsen inflation for 2 reasons. Firstly&nbsp;consumer spending and investment spending are 'sticky'.&nbsp;People keep to their lifestyle and keep all their purchases.&nbsp;They seek ways to pay the higher interest rate.&nbsp;They may raise their own prices (for the self-employed)&nbsp;or demand for higher wages. These actions cause&nbsp;inflation. Firms, too, will raise prices of their finished&nbsp;products rather than cut investment spending.<br>In the short term, higher interest can cause demand for&nbsp;credit to rise. This is because producers and consumers&nbsp;see the rise as a trend. They borrow more in the current&nbsp;time to avoid higher interest rates in the near future.&nbsp;Therefore MP fails to tame inflation.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the effects of a contractionary MP&nbsp;may have its desired effects. Refer to the diagram. The&nbsp;AD rises to only AD<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and not AD<sub>1</sub>. Prices rise to only&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub> and not P<sub>1</sub> due to the contractionary policies.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8577e60dd78d6201b2aa4f551dc27e85" alt="" width="397" height="191"><br><br>When the money supply falls from MS<sub>0</sub> to MS<sub>1</sub>, the&nbsp;interest rate rises from r<sub>0</sub> to r<sub>1</sub>. This makes money costly&nbsp;to use. Consumers save because the opportunity cost&nbsp;of spending is high. Those on credit will now borrow&nbsp;less for the same reasons. Thus demand falls or its&nbsp;increase slows down.</p>
<p>The higher interest rates also attract domestic savings&nbsp;and foreign capital or "hot money". This may cause&nbsp;an appreciation in the country's currency, which in tum&nbsp;reduce its export competitiveness. The decrease in&nbsp;demand for local goods by foreign countries has a&nbsp;deflationary effect on the economy.</p>
<p>Another factor that can cause the inflation rate to fall&nbsp;is a sharp increase in output, which causes supply to&nbsp;increase faster than demand increases. A rapid rise in&nbsp;the level of output can be achieved by technological&nbsp;advances, increased efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>The price level is stable (P<sub>0</sub>) because AS increased as&nbsp;much as AD.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a1cceacc016a5512797a29872e37f102" alt="" width="381" height="176"><br><br>The cure to an inflationary situation really depends on&nbsp;the cause or causes of inflation.

This in&nbsp;turns regulates the interest rates. Interest rates affect the&nbsp;level of consumption, investments and indirectly exports.&nbsp;It can also influence government spending, which&nbsp;is a substantial component of AD.</p>
<p>MP can cause prices to destabilize, which may cause inflation.&nbsp;If MP is expansionary, the money supply will&nbsp;increase. The Central Bank relaxes on quantitative and&nbsp;qualitative tools. For example, the CB discount rate is&nbsp;lowered, bonds are bought up by the CB and the cash&nbsp;ratio of commercial banks is lowered. Regulations are&nbsp;also relaxed to make it easy for people to borrow. The&nbsp;increase in money supply causes interest rates to fall:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/3d6810fc99b5d805ef4928260011eb54" alt="" width="311" height="168"></p>
<p>Interest rates falls from r<sub>0</sub> to r<sub>1</sub> because the money supply&nbsp;increased from MS<sub>0</sub> to MS<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>With the fall in interest rate, household consumption&nbsp;increases. This is because the opportunity cost of consumption,&nbsp;that is interest, is low. Borrowing also becomes&nbsp;cheap. The excess consumption, especially on&nbsp;credit, causes demand for goods and services to rise.&nbsp;Inflation results if the supply of goods cannot cope&nbsp;with the excess demand.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f85443b7b71122e28a8e10b91f7207d0" alt="" width="374" height="194"></p>
<p>Secondly, the lower interest rate will create more investments&nbsp;as firms now, find many projects profitable.&nbsp;This causes a large increase in demand for resources&nbsp;- land, property, labour and material. If supply of these&nbsp;is inelastic, then their costs rise. The higher cost of&nbsp;production is pushed to consumers in the form of higher&nbsp;prices:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/7d58ffb88f5e68d27b84a8b59ae61063" alt="" width="364" height="211"></p>
<p>Factor prices rise due to increase in demand.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c01d79cdca8a9b1e34085b773904d01f" alt="" width="349" height="206"></p>
<p>Product prices rise due to fall in supply caused by higher&nbsp;factor costs: ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the fall in interest rates can cause the country's&nbsp;currency to depreciate: Assuming a flexible exchange&nbsp;rate system, it causes an overflow of funds. The fall&nbsp;in the currency increases the demand for local goods&nbsp;by both locals and foreigners. It also makes imports more costly. All these add to inflation.</p>
<p>The above can be summarized by the Fisher's equation&nbsp;of the Quantity Theory of Money:</p>
<p>MV = PT; if V and T are constant, then an increase in&nbsp;M (money supply) causes P (prices) to rise. Even if&nbsp;T (national output) rises, prices will still climb if output&nbsp;does not catch up with demand caused by the rise in&nbsp;M.</p>
<p>MP is not the only factor causing inflation. Therefore&nbsp;other factors can offset the rise in money supply to&nbsp;eliminate inflation. For example, prices would remain&nbsp;stable if the rise in M is offset by a fall in V. These&nbsp;means that people choose not to spend. On the other&nbsp;hand, price will rise if T (output) falls even if money supply remains constant. In conclusion, we can say&nbsp;that a direct link between the monetary policy and stable&nbsp;prices is not always the case.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 277</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8563</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>To what extent might other macroeconomic problems&nbsp;result from the use of fiscal policy that is designed to&nbsp;reduce unemployment in an economy?</p>

Fiscal policy is the major tool to achieve these&nbsp;objectives, especially in developing countries. In such&nbsp;countries, the private sector is incapable to generate&nbsp;growth: income and jobs. Even, in developed countries&nbsp;fiscal policy is a major tool. However fiscal policy is&nbsp;usually implemented together with other policies -&nbsp;monetary, exchange rate and direct controls.</p>
<p>The aim&nbsp;is to create jobs and to attain other macro objectives.</p>
<p>All governments have the long-term objectives of raising&nbsp;living standards and achieving full employment. In their&nbsp;attempts to do so, the short-term consequences of the&nbsp;methods used may be inflation, and a balance of&nbsp;payments deficit. Thus in order to solve these short-term&nbsp;difficulties, the government may have to slow down&nbsp;or, temporary, suspend the stated long-term objectives.</p>

Based on the Keynesian&nbsp;theory, an increase in demand will lead to a multiple&nbsp;increase in supply or national income. The rise in income&nbsp;can only be due to an increase in employment of&nbsp;resources. The rise in income also gives a higher standard&nbsp;of living, if we assume that the population is&nbsp;constant, or at least, did not rise as fast as income.</p>
<p>In an expansionary monetary policy, the government&nbsp;increases the money supply. This is done by relaxing&nbsp;both quantitative and qualitative controls. It causes&nbsp;interest rates to fall, which stimulates household consumption&nbsp;and business investments. In the case of fiscal&nbsp;policy, the government may reduce taxes so as to&nbsp;increase disposable income and the surpluses of enterprises.&nbsp;This enables them to spend more. The government,&nbsp;on its part, increases expenditure on public works&nbsp;and increases transfer payments. An expansionary fiscal&nbsp;policy may mean that a government will have to&nbsp;run a deficit budget; financing it by borrowing or taking&nbsp;from reserves. Direct expansionary measures are used&nbsp;in the form of compulsory consumption of certain goods,&nbsp;and lifting public ceilings on rents, houses and other&nbsp;commodities.</p>
<p>In developing countries, the government, normally takes&nbsp;the lead in increasing income because of an inadequate&nbsp;private sector. Largely through borrowings and aid the&nbsp;government spends on the infrastructure and in the&nbsp;developing of new industries; especially in the secondary&nbsp;and tertiary sectors.</p>
<p>The above description on how governments try to create&nbsp;jobs and income, does definitely lead to one thing: it&nbsp;increases aggregate demand. If output or national income&nbsp;increases proportionately, then the objective would&nbsp;have been achieved. However, if output fails to rise at&nbsp;all or rises less than proportionately, then the general&nbsp;price level would rise. This means inflation.</p>
<p>The causes of income or output not increasing may be&nbsp;due to the following: firstly, there were structural rigidities.&nbsp;Factors of production were not able to respond&nbsp;to the increase in demand. The infrastructure of the&nbsp;country may be inadequate, its labour productivity low&nbsp;and entrepreneurs may be incapable of increasing output.&nbsp;Even political instability and social unrest may be the&nbsp;causes.</p>
<p>The inflation rate, if it reaches higher than acceptable&nbsp;levels, may have adverse effects on the economy; it is&nbsp;counter productive. People experience a fall in their&nbsp;real incomes and clamour for higher wage increases.&nbsp;The vicious 'wage-prices-spiral' that eventually sets in&nbsp;causes the loss of competitiveness, business failures&nbsp;and unemployment. Generally, output and employment&nbsp;fall due to this disruption in the economy.</p>
<p>In order to bring the inflation rate down, the government&nbsp;is compelled to adopt deflationary policies: a&nbsp;contraction of the money supply and a budget surplus.&nbsp;However this short-term objective will be at the expense&nbsp;of the long-term objectives of higher employment&nbsp;and income levels. Tlie contractionary policies&nbsp;cause demand to fall. Without a strong demand, there&nbsp;would be no increase in supply. Thus, no need to employ&nbsp;additional workers. In fact presently employed workers&nbsp;may be asked to leave.</p>
<p>In its attempt to achieve full employment and a higher&nbsp;standard of living, a country may find itself having to&nbsp;import large amounts of tangible and intangible products&nbsp;from other countries. In Singapore's case, she had&nbsp;to borrow money and buy goods and services from the&nbsp;developed countries to build her housing estates, industrial&nbsp;estates, power plants, highways, sea port, airport&nbsp;and the MRT. Clearly, her balance of payments current&nbsp;account was in the deficit in those development years.&nbsp;Therefore, the price to be paid for income generation&nbsp;and employment is an external debt, at least, in the&nbsp;short-term. Upon the successful completion of these&nbsp;projects, income was generated and the debt was paid&nbsp;off However, not all countries' projects may be successful.&nbsp;When major projects fail, a country may end&nbsp;up with a large external debt. If not cleared, the external debt grows because the interest accumulates. This&nbsp;lays a future claim on the country's national income.&nbsp;In order to service and retire a debt, a government will&nbsp;have to go on a budget surplus and a contractionary&nbsp;monetary policy. This means, its policy of creating jobs&nbsp;and income has to be temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>All countries have the long-term objective of external&nbsp;equilibrium. This means a balanced balance of payment&nbsp;and a stable exchange rate. A balance of payment surplus&nbsp;too, may not be desirable for one country's surplus is&nbsp;another country's deficit. For long-term prosperity a&nbsp;country has to spend its surplus so that its trading&nbsp;partners can remain as trading partners. A surplus can&nbsp;also cause inflation if the country exports too much of&nbsp;its produce. The excessive money supply, the inflation&nbsp;and the strong currency may erode the long-term&nbsp;competitiveness of the country. Thus the government&nbsp;would have to adopt policies to counteract these trends.&nbsp;This, again, means temporarily suspending the objectives&nbsp;of full employment and rapid economic growth.</p>
<p>We can say that the long-term objectives of all countries&nbsp;are full employment and a high standard of living.&nbsp;However due to problems that may arise in the short-term,&nbsp;a government may have to deal with the latter&nbsp;first before continuing with the long-term ones. These&nbsp;problems are, normally, inflation and a balance of&nbsp;payment deficit.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 278</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8559</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what determines the size of the national income&nbsp;multiplier.</p>

<p>k = ΔY/ΔAD = ΔY/ΔJ</p>
<p>A closed economy with no government is a 2-sector&nbsp;economy. The only leakage and injection are savings&nbsp;and investments respectively. Thus the multiplier is&nbsp;stronger, because it has only one leakage to weaken&nbsp;it. Thus an injection (investment of $100 m in our above&nbsp;example) gives total income of $500 m, if k is 5&nbsp;(mps = 0.2).</p>
<p>In a 4-sector economy, like in the UK or Singapore&nbsp;there are two more leakages - imports and taxation.&nbsp;Thus the multiplier is weakened by a greater amount.&nbsp;If we assume the MPM = 0.1 and the MPT = 0.2, then&nbsp;the income generated from a $100 m of investments is:</p>
<p>Y=100&nbsp;× [1/(MPS+MPM+MPT)]<br>Y=100&nbsp;× (1/0.5)<br>Y=200 m</p>
<p>Thus the UK or Singapore economic growth in income&nbsp;will be a lot smaller than for the closed economy, given&nbsp;the same injection.</p>
<p>However, just as leakages are many injections for a 4-sector economy are many too. They are in the form&nbsp;of exports and government expenditure. Therefore it&nbsp;may be 3 rounds of injections coming from exports&nbsp;($100 m), government ($100 m) and investments&nbsp;($100 m), working on a small multiplier. It can give&nbsp;more income than an injection of one round of $100 m&nbsp;on a multiplier of 5.</p>
<p>In the real world, open economies are far richer than&nbsp;closed ones. In terms of economic growth, standard of&nbsp;living, investment and employment the former is better.&nbsp;Based on this, we can assume that injections in these&nbsp;countries are more than withdrawals, and thus they enjoy&nbsp;a greater increase in income.<br>Even among other 4-sector economies the value of multiplier&nbsp;can differ due to differences in the MPT, MPM&nbsp;and MPT.</p>
<p>The value of MPS differs due to differences in interest&nbsp;rates, trust in financial institutions, personal values of&nbsp;thriftiness, and government fiscal policy on savings and&nbsp;income levels. These factors affect the ratio of savings.</p>
<p>The MPM may differ due to the extent of economic&nbsp;specialization, the exchange rate, taste for import and&nbsp;natural endowment. The ratio of imports to income can&nbsp;also be due to the level of protectionism a government&nbsp;adopts. A country who subscribes to complete free trade&nbsp;has a higher MPM.</p>
<p>The level of MPT depends on the number of taxes a&nbsp;country has, both direct and indirect. It also depends&nbsp;on the percentage tax rates and the progressiveness of&nbsp;these rates. A welfare country or a government heavily&nbsp;in debt will have more taxes, higher rates and progressive&nbsp;rates. These makes the MPT higher and the multiplier weaker.</p>
<p>In conclusion we say the greater the leakages, the smaller&nbsp;the value of the multiplier (k).</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 279</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8554</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the view that the profit motive will always lead&nbsp;to a few large firms dominating the market for each&nbsp;and every type of product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The first issue raised in the question is&nbsp;the 'profit&nbsp;motive'. It is true, in principle that all firms want to&nbsp;maximize profit, but this is not always the case. Firms&nbsp;especially in the private sector aim to maximise profits.&nbsp;They do so through initiative and creativity. Whether&nbsp;they are able to sustain their high levels of profits or&nbsp;abnormal profits, depends on the nature of the market&nbsp;the industry is in. This too, actually, depends on entrepreneurship&nbsp;because it is they who create the type&nbsp;of market they are in.</p>
<p>In the short run, firms try to increase profits by any&nbsp;one of two ways - increase the demand for its products,&nbsp;and, secondly, lowering its unit cost of production.<br>The first can be achieved by advertising In the mass&nbsp;media - TV, radio, newspaper etc. and to conduct&nbsp;promotional activities - contests, draws, free gifts etc.&nbsp;The firm increases profits because of a wider profit&nbsp;margin and more sales. Refer to the diagram:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d88975a812bc016491fd06437fb0f38d" alt="" width="309" height="200"><br><br>Advertising raised demand from AR<sub>0</sub> to AR<sub>1</sub> creating&nbsp;supernormal profits (shaded area). Cost rose by a smaller&nbsp;account to AC<sub>2</sub>. To lower AC, the firms needs to make a more efficient&nbsp;use of present resources (in the SR) or to exploit all&nbsp;potential economies of scale, EOS (in the long run).&nbsp;Examples of EOS are: technical managerial, bulk&nbsp;buying, financial, research and risks bearing. All these&nbsp;aid to lower unit cost. With a constant price, the profit&nbsp;margin widens. In fact, the lower AC enables firms to&nbsp;cut prices and increase total profits through more sales.</p>
<p>Next, firms aim to continue earning supernormal profits.&nbsp;This is done by putting up barriers to entry (BTEs).&nbsp;These factors try to put out of business existing rival&nbsp;firms and prevent the entry of new ones. If a firm is&nbsp;successful in its attempts to put up BTEs, then the market&nbsp;becomes imperfect - it moves into an oligopoly or&nbsp;monopoly situation. Examples of BTEs are patent rights,&nbsp;brand loyalty, EOS, control over retail outlets, control&nbsp;over essential factor input and government policy.&nbsp;However if other firms are successful in overcoming&nbsp;BTE or if the government adopts an active policy to&nbsp;keep markets competitive, then the supernormal profits&nbsp;of firms will be eroded. In the long run, they will make&nbsp;only normal profits.</p>
<p>One cannot always assume that firms would always&nbsp;want to maximise profits. There are productive units&nbsp;in, both, the private and public sectors that have other&nbsp;motives. Public sector firms can be welfare motivated,&nbsp;therefore producing where P = MC (allocative efficiency)&nbsp;and not MC= MR (profit maximisation). Other&nbsp;state enterprises go for maximum utilization of capacity&nbsp;and maximum consumption, so long as profits do&nbsp;not fall below normal. Examples would be community&nbsp;centres. Still, other state enterprises accept subnormal&nbsp;profit, even in the long run, so as to maximise welfare&nbsp;of the people. The losses are paid for by tax revenue.&nbsp;In the private sector, too, there are firms, who do not&nbsp;go for profit maximisation for the same reasons as above.&nbsp;Other firms may adopt a lower price, and therefore&nbsp;lower profit, if it serves to keep others out or to preserve&nbsp;market share. Some private enterprises even&nbsp;continue on loss-making divisions of their business&nbsp;solely for prestige. Therefore profit is not always the&nbsp;motive.</p>
<p>The profit motive however, has led to the creation of&nbsp;large firms; oligopolies and even monopolies.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to explain why oligopoly and&nbsp;monopoly markets are common. The market for many&nbsp;products in major countries are characterized by a few&nbsp;big sellers. For sports shoes, it has been Nike and&nbsp;Reebok. For soft drinks, it has been Coke and Pepsi. For computers, it has been IBM and Apple. For cars and electrical goods&nbsp;only a few names are recurrent.</p>
<p>One reason to explain this is the large capital outlay&nbsp;a company needs to start off production. Modern technology&nbsp;is expensive. The market today is characterized&nbsp;by mass produced goods which give lower unit cost&nbsp;and therefore price. Therefore the number of new firms&nbsp;entering the market has fallen drastically.</p>
<p>A second reason is the intensity of competition. To remain&nbsp;such, companies need to lower cost by exploiting&nbsp;economies of scale. Firms have resorted to mergers and&nbsp;acquisitions so as to increase their capital. In tum, they&nbsp;are able to enjoy the economies of bulk buying, better&nbsp;CEOs, modem technology, labour specialisation, advertising&nbsp;and vertical and horizontal integration.</p>
<p>A third reason is a change in consumer buying habits.&nbsp;Today consumers are no longer willing to buy from&nbsp;small and unknown companies. They rather buy from&nbsp;big and well-known companies, even if price is higher&nbsp;because of the guarantees and better after-sales services.&nbsp;Modem electronics have made consumers helpless&nbsp;whenever products fail. There is nothing for him&nbsp;to repair himself. Therefore it is best to buy from a&nbsp;reputable company.</p>
<p>Lastly, another reason why markets have become oligopolies&nbsp;is better entrepreneurship. Today's businessmen&nbsp;are better educated. The large firm knows that its&nbsp;firm gains when producers cooperate in price and output. This may not necessarily be at the expense of consumers.</p>
<p>In the long run, consumers gain with better and cheaper&nbsp;products. The entrepreneur gains with more profits.</p>
<p>The above are reasons why large firms dominate; but&nbsp;even than not "for each and every type of product".&nbsp;The nature of some products is that only small firms&nbsp;can exist. The dentist, masseuse, and tutor services are good examples. And this is true in the case of custom made goods like cakes, clothes,&nbsp;furniture. Luxury goods producers can only be small&nbsp;so as to be prestigious.</p>
<p>In summary, it has shown that even the largest firm can&nbsp;wind up, small new firms are still able to break into&nbsp;the market.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 280</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8551</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Using appropriate examples, explain the difference&nbsp;between internal and external economies of scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Economies of Scale are cost saving advantages to a&nbsp;firm due to the larger scale and the growth of the&nbsp;industry. Therefore we have internal economies (IEOS)&nbsp;and external economies of scale (EEOS). Their nature&nbsp;is that they occur in the long run where all the factors&nbsp;of production are variable. In the short-run firms suffer&nbsp;from a rising marginal cost (called diminishing returns)&nbsp;when they increase output due to the constraints of a&nbsp;fixed factor input. This problem is solved when the&nbsp;firm expands its scale of operation. It results in a lower&nbsp;MC and AC for larger levels of output. Thus the nature&nbsp;of economies are that they are cost-saving and they&nbsp;operate only in the long run.</p>
<p>Internal EOS are savings to the firm when the firm&nbsp;itself expands. Their total cost rises but slower than its&nbsp;output rises. The AC falls. External EOS are cost saving&nbsp;due to the expansion of the whole industry. Factors&nbsp;outside the firm help it to save cost. The entire LRAC<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>shifts downwards to LRAC<sub>2</sub>. A large firm may enjoy&nbsp;the following economies. Firstly, technical economies&nbsp;due to the specialisation of labour, synergy, the use of&nbsp;advance machinery, adopting the assembly line method&nbsp;of production and buying factor inputs in bulk. All these&nbsp;cause productivity to increase and thus the cost per unit&nbsp;falls. A large firm also enjoys administrative or managerial&nbsp;economies where professional managers and&nbsp;specialist staff are employed. They do a far better job.&nbsp;A large company also benefits from marketing and&nbsp;advertising economies. Financial economies allow it to&nbsp;have bigger discounts and longer periods of credit.&nbsp;Welfare economies ensure a dedicated and hard-working&nbsp;staff. Risk economies allows the company to diversify&nbsp;into other lines of business. By-product economies&nbsp;enables the large firm to make full use of all its&nbsp;assets, including its wastes. In addition, larger&nbsp;firms enjoy economies of vertical and horizontal integration.&nbsp;Here, firms may go into other types of production&nbsp;which is part of the production process towards&nbsp;the final good. For example, a publisher may open up&nbsp;a bookshop, a paper company and a printing company.&nbsp;Apart from servicing others, self-owned companies get&nbsp;special discounts. The effects of EOS is to lower the&nbsp;unit cost of production or average cost:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/301cdeda03f8d19150bd63062c586747" alt="" width="348" height="172"><br><br>External Economies of Scale (EEOS) causes the LRAC&nbsp;to fall as the firm expands scale.</p>
<p>EEOS are concentration, trained labour, locality, reputation,&nbsp;information, amenities and facilities. It is easy&nbsp;for the firm to fund the right supporting industries and&nbsp;government offices. There is already a pool of trained&nbsp;workers. The place holds a reputation, it sells itself.&nbsp;Therefore customers conveniently flock there. No need&nbsp;for the firm to advertise. Another example of EEOS&nbsp;is technological advancement. When one firm does R&amp;D and invents a new type of machine, procedure or&nbsp;scientific concept, all firms get to benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both IEOS and EEOS cause AC to fall. The former&nbsp;due to the firms own actions and the latter due to the&nbsp;actions of other firms.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 281</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8550</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the effect of an increase in the supply of money on interest rates and national income.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>In the money market the condition for monetary equilibrium is that the rate of interest will be such that everyone is just willing to hold the existing supply of money, i.e. interest rate does the job of equating the quantity of money demanded to the available supply and hence produces monetary equilibrium. In the figure below, we see how the interest rate produces monetary equilibrium.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/53a4910d36615a6e9dc7a40677f05269" alt="" width="334" height="236"></p>
<p>Equilibrium is achieved with a rate of interest Re and the quantity of money Me. If the rate of interest were above Re, people would have money balances surplus to their needs. They would use these to buy securities and other assets. This would drive up the price of securities and drive down the rate of interest toward equilibrium. Similarly, if the rate of interest were below Re, people would have insufficient money balances. They would sell securities, thus lowering their prices and raising the rate of interest until it reached the equilibrium level.</p>
<p>Changes in money supply will affect national income via changes in the rate of interest. Let's assume that monetary authorities seek to adopt easy monetary measures and attempt to increase money supply, say, by lowering liquidity ratio of commercial banks.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/d02c5b6c820a47820c451e41683b5ed2" alt="" width="450" height="321"></p>
<p>These measures shift the supply curve of money from MS to MS<sub>1</sub> as shown in the first part of the graph. Consequently, there is excess supply of money at the existing rate of interest Re. People still wish to hold only Me of money balances, but Me<sub>1</sub> is now available. In order to eliminate their excess holdings of money, people attempt to buy bonds and securities. This attempt of buying bonds and other financial assets increases their price and subsequently lowers the rate of interest. When interest has fallen to Re<sub>1</sub> the quantity of money demanded will have risen to equal the available supply of Me<sub>1</sub>. Monetary equilibrium is, thus re-established, though at a lower rate of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The curve in the other part of the graph is called a marginal efficiency of investment curve (or just a demand for investment curve). MEI curve shows the relation between planned investment and the rate of interest, assuming all other things are equal. It is derived from prospective yield of one more unit of investment and the cost of obtaining it. Firms make their investment decisions by comparing MEI with the rate of interest. For instance, if the expected real net rate of return on an individual project (MEI) is greater than the real rate of interest, investment is profitable and hence is undertaken. Thus investment demand curve shows that the lower the rate of interest, the larger will be the number of investment opportunities that will show a profit and, hence, the larger the volume of investment expenditure that firms wish to undertake.</p>
<p>Note that, because both parts of the Figure above have the interest rate on the vertical axis, the interest rate can be compared between the two parts. Both parts show an initial equilibrium with the quantity of money of Ms and an interest rate of Re. When this equilibrium is disturbed by an increase in the money supply to Ms<sub>1</sub>, the rate of interest falls to Re<sub>1</sub> Part (ii) of the Figure tells us that the fall in the interest rate from Re to Re<sub>1</sub> increases desired investment expenditure from I<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;to&nbsp;I<sub>2</sub>.<sub><br></sub></p>
<p>So far, we have seen that an increase in the money supply leads to a fall in the interest rate which, in turn, results in an increase in desired investment expenditure. We extend our analysis to finally figure out how these changes subsequently affect NY.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/582bbec27c8aa831083a239d98136eb6" alt="" width="439" height="228"></p>
<p>Equilibrium NY can be found by W = J. The withdrawals function is the vertical sum of the net savings, net taxes and import functions. Similarly, total injection is the vertical addition of the investment, government expenditure and export functions. Initially, the equilibrium can be located at point a, indicating Y<sub>1</sub> as the equilibrium level of NY. A rise in investment expenditure shifts the J function upwards and will cause NY to increase (Y<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;- Y) by more than the increase in investment (b c). The number of times that the increase in income (△Y) is greater than the increase in investment is known as the multiplier (k).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what causes the multiplier effect? The answer is that, any increase in injection into the economy will produce a stream of new incomes through additional spending. For example, if firms to invest more, this will lead to more people being employed and hence more incomes being paid to households. Households will then spend part of this increased income on domestically produced goods (the remainder will be withdrawn). This increased consumption will encourage firms to produce more goods to meet the demand. Firms will thus employ more people and other factors of production. This leads to even more incomes being paid out to households. Consumption will thus increase yet again, and so the process continues.</p>
<p>Since multiplier is not infinite, therefore, an increase in injections would not cause national income to go on rising forever. Each time people receive extra income they will save some of it, pay some of it in taxes and spend some of it on imports. Eventually, as income goes on rising, all the extra injections will have leaked away into the three withdrawals.</p>
<p>At that point the multiplier process will have ceased; a new equilibrium Y<sub>2</sub> will have been reached.</p>
<p>Note that in this simple Keynesian theory we are assuming that prices are constant (i.e. that there is no inflation) and hence that any increase in income is a real increase in income matched by extra production. So when we talk about extra injections into the economy causing extra spending, it is the extra output that this spending generates that we are concerned with. But if the economy is already operating at full employment and no extra resources available to produce output to match with the rising demand for both capital goods and consumer goods then increase in MS results in an increase in price level and no change in real NY. <br>In conclusion, increase in money supply causes interest rate to fall and real national income to rise via increase in desired investment expenditure. But the effect on real national income depends on the ability of the economy to increase output in response to increase in both consumer spending and investment expenditure.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 282</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8549</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>For what purposes do people demand money?&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The demand for money refers to the amount of wealth everyone in the economy wishes to hold in the form of money balances. In the Keynesian analysis of the rate of interest, the demand for money is not based purely on the demand for new capital goods. In fact, Keynes argued that there are three distinct motives for preferring to hold wealth in the form of money as opposed to holding either non-money financial assets or physical assets.</p>
<p><strong>The transactions demand for money</strong> <br>Individuals need to hold money in order to meet daily transactions such as buying petrol, paying for groceries or purchasing a newspaper. Everyone will hold a certain amount of money since they are normally paid weekly or monthly whereas their expenditure is spread over the whole period. The average amount held for transactions purposes depends upon the level of money income, the price level and the frequency of pay days. In terms of money income, the higher the money income, the more likely the individual is to purchase more goods and services, and therefore require extra transactions balances. If the price level increases the demand for money for transactions purposes will be higher. In the case of the frequency of pay days, the more frequent, the lower the transactions demand for money.</p>
<p><strong>The precautionary demand for money<br></strong>The demand for money is also based on the desire to provide for the unexpected. The precautionary demand for money allows the individual to cover unforeseen events, such as the car breaking down, a lengthy period off work through illness, or an unexpected redundancy. It is likely to be the case that as the rate of interest increases, the precautionary demand for money will fall as individuals place their money in interest-bearing assets, i.e. the cost of 'holding' money has increased. Money balances held for these two purposes is called active balances (L<sub>1</sub>) i.e. money to be used as a medium of exchange.<strong> <br></strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="./AL Econ_files/339d01a65d168f4a5ce089dd9bb4a1f7" alt=""><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>The speculative demand for money <br></strong>Speculative demand for money is based on the expectation of making a speculative gain or avoiding a loss. Money balances held for this purpose are called idle balances (L<sub>2</sub>). Keynes outlined the speculative demand for money in terms of the desire to hold money or fixed income bonds. It is important to note that the price of bonds and the rate of interest are inversely related. When the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly high by individuals they will assume that the next move is in a downward direction. As stated, when the rate of interest falls the price of bonds increases and so there are capital gains to be made. This being so, when the rate of interest is high there will be a substantial demand for bonds and hence a low speculative demand to hold money. If, however, the rate of interest is perceived to be unduly low then individuals will assume that the next move is upwards, resulting in a fall in bond prices and, therefore, a capital loss for those who own bonds. If this is the case, the demand for bonds is likely to be low and those owning bonds will be looking to sell them before the price falls. In this situation the speculative demand for money will be high as shown in the graph below:<strong> <br></strong></p>

For this purpose, economists have used Real GNP per head.</p>
<p>Real GNP is a monetary measure of economic activity generated from all national resources both at home and abroad minus the rate of inflation. Real GNP per head can be measured by the following formulae:</p>
<p>RGNP /&nbsp;Total population =&nbsp;RGNP per head&nbsp;</p>
<p>RGNP per capita is a measure of how much of real goods and services is available to the average citizen for consumption and investment. It is widely held that there should be a strong positive correlation between RGNP per capita and standard of living; that is, greater production should move society towards "the good life" and vice versa. Therefore, economists view levels and rates of growth of "real" per capita GNP, as a useful indicator of living standard.</p>
<p>The critics, however, believe that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being as a nation. For instance, in many cases an increase in national income may be the result of longer working hours, inferior working conditions, longer journeys to work, payments for services necessitated by the stress of modern living e.g. anti-depressant drugs, and higher social costs such as pollution. They point out that many aspects of quality of life such as leisure, happiness and health cannot be measured simply in terms of income, output or expenditure. Also, there are some inherent problems with the measurement of NY which make it less reliable indicator of living standard.</p>
<p>A decrease in national income does not necessarily results in a decline in standard of living for various reasons. A rise in the proportion of black economy may reduce national income without causing a decline in the living standard. Similarly, when reduction in national income is the result of a decrease in number of hours worked in accordance with the preferences of workers then people would have less to consume but more leisure time may increase their level of happiness. Furthermore, if national income falls due to a reduction in defence related expenditure as nation may particularly feel more secure from any foreign aggression then quality of life would improve. Failure to account quality improvement is another serious shortcoming of national income.</p>
<p>Economists point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off without necessarily achieving higher RGNP per head, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse. Similarly, rising RGNP per head is usually accompanied by rising external cost, such as pollution, noise and accidents. These are not officially measured within national income but they do affect welfare and distort comparison of well-being of a nation over time.</p>
<p>Thus, we must understand that GNP is not a complete measure of economic welfare; nor is it meant to be. It is a measure of output or income, and should be seen in that context.</p>
<p>We can use a range of alternative indicators to assess changes in living standard of a country.</p>
<p>The most well-known measure of quality of life is the Human Development Index (HDI) that has been developed under the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
<p>The Human Development Index (HDI) is the average of three indicators:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight)</p>
<p>The closer the HDI is to I, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators.</p>
<p>The advantage of using HDI is that it highlights the fact that people's welfare is influenced not only by the goods and services available to them but also by their ability to lead a long and healthy life and to acquire knowledge, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative factors.</p>
<p>As mentioned above income is an integral component of quality of life but not the only factor, we also need to consider the data on some important economic variables which determine the over all outlook of an economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 284</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8547</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>It is feared that if the government increases taxes the level of national income will fall.

Governments can influence the flow of national income by altering their policy related to expenditure and levying of taxation.</p>
<p>Tax is a legal compulsion and results in a transfer of money from individuals and businesses to government, therefore, represent a leakage. An important classification of taxes is direct taxes such as income tax and indirect taxes such as VAT, Excise duty etc. </p>
<p>A change in direct tax rates changes the relationship between disposable income and national income. As a result, the relationship between planned consumption and national income also changes i.e. for any given level of income there will be a different level of disposable income and thus a different level of consumption and investment. </p>
<p>A rise in direct tax rates with no corresponding change in government expenditures causes a decrease in both disposable income and consumption expenditure at each level of national income. This results in pivotal downward shift of the aggregate expenditure, and thus decreases the level of national income equilibrium. </p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/35bdf888bac48abe85ea05121576f612" alt="" width="427" height="242"></p>
<p>It is now possible to see what happens if the government increases rates of tax so that more tax is paid at every level of income. As shown in the figure above, an increase in the marginal propensity to tax will lower the marginal propensity to consume out of national income . This can be shown by a swing downwards in the consumption function from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub>. Ifwe now add planned investment and government spending, we arrive at the aggregate expenditure lines in figure above. A rise in tax rates has led to a fall in aggregate expenditure from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub> and as a consequence, the equilibrium national income falls from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>However, the final effect on national income can only be estimated by considering the other side of the coin i.e corresponding changes in government expenditure. An increase in tax rates with no corresponding change in government expenditure would result in a fall in national income. But what if government increases both taxes and expenditure by the same amount? The outcome of it can be different. For instance, if majority of taxpayers fund the extra taxes by reducing their savings rather than consumption and government spends money on projects related to welfare of people such as housing, national income is likely to rise due to the redistribution of income from taxpayers to the underprivileged. </p>
<p>Similarly, the effect of rise in tax depends on whom the increase in tax is levied for instance, raising taxes on higher incomes will lead to a small decrease in consumption due to lower MPC and larger decrease in savings. Thus an increase in tax rate would result in relatively smaller fall in aggregate expenditure and hence, a smaller fall in NY. On the contrary, when increase in tax applies more on lower income group then, due to their higher MPC, it would lead to a larger fall both in consumption and national income </p>
<p>Raising indirect taxes are also likely to reduce AE when tax rates are increased on goods with high price elasticity of demand. On the contrary, increase in taxes on goods with low price elasticity of demand will result in an increase in consumer spending and reduction in savings. Hence an increase in taxation would lead to an increase in government revenue and, if this were used to finance public expenditure, there might be an overall increase in national income. Similarly, increasing tariffs rate as part of protectionist policy can help switch expenditure on local products resulting in an increase in AE and NY. <br>Thus, we conclude that raising taxes does not necessarily lead to a fall in national income. Overall, the effects of raising taxes on NY depend on a number of factors as explained in the answer.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 285</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8546</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The solution to unsatisfactory economic development and growth is to focus on economic theory, scientific advances, new technology and market forces.</p>

<li>In strictly economic terms, development has traditionally meant the capacity of a national economy, to generate and sustain an annual increase in its gross domestic product (GDP) at rates of 5% to 7% or more. As an alternative, real GNP per capita has been used as a measure of development to take into account the ability of a nation to expand its output at a rate faster than the growth rate of its population. In 1950s and 1960s, there was an assumption amongst economists that economic growth and economic development were closely linked. High economic growth would lead to fast economic development and vice versa. However, in the 1970s, this assumption was severely questioned. It was correctly pointed out that economic growth only measured growth in a limited number of variables in the economy. It took no account of a large number of other variables in the economy, ranging from health, to the environment, to the distribution of resources within the economy. <br>The modern view of development puts it as the process of improving the quality of all aspects of human lives. Economists identify three equally important aspects of development. <br>Firstly, development is reflected by increasing incomes and consumption levels of food, medical services, education etc., through relevant economic growth processes. Development is not just about providing basic needs for the whole population. It is also about raising standards of living beyond that of subsistence level. Higher incomes are thus an important sign of rising living standards as they would result in whole range of goods becoming affordable, from televisions to meals out to travel.<br>Secondly, development means creating conditions conducive to the growth of people's self-esteem through the establishment of social, political and economic systems and institutions that promote human dignity and respect. For instance, improved education not only allows the workforce to become more productive. It also increases the ability of individuals to enjoy and appreciate their culture. Access to work not only provides individuals and their dependents with an income. It also provides self-esteem and a sense of purpose. Development is about giving societies and individuals within those societies greater choice. Development is also about giving nations greater freedom to decide on their economic objectives. It is also about political freedom, such as the right to free speech, or to choose where to live or who to meet. Access to a clean environment not only contributes to today's standard of living but is also an indication that this standard of living is sustainable for one's children. <br>Thirdly, development increases people's freedom by enlarging the range of their choice by increasing varieties of consumer goods and services. At the individual level, economic development is about allowing people to decide what to buy today, rather than being forced to buy basic necessities only. It is about controlling where one works, which implies that there are jobs available in the economy.<br>To sum up, development must, therefore, be conceived as a multi-dimensional process involving major changes in social, economic, and political structures. It also entails higher incomes, reduction in inequality and eradication of poverty.</li>
<li>Technological changes are regarded as the most important factor in the process of economic growth. They are related to changes in the methods of production, which are the result of some new research and development. Improvement in technology leads to increase in productivity of labour and other inputs and results in higher level of output with the same quantity of inputs. Hence, technological advances can be regarded as shifting the production possibility curve so that same amount of labour and capital produces greater output. Increases in productive capacity that are created by installing new and better capital goods accelerates growth and improves living standard. <br>New and improved technology stems from research and development and from innovating activities that put the results of R&amp;D into practice. Scientific advances cause continual changes in the techniques of production and in the nature of what is produced. These are costly and highly risky activities, undertaken largely by firms and usually in pursuit of profit. In the absence of economic incentive R&amp;D is not taken up by firms therefore government must allocate resources to continue the flow of technological advances.&nbsp;<br>Greater reliance on market forces has also proven to be successful in achieving high growth rates. The demand and supply forces not only ensure efficient use of scarce resources but provide incentive to producers to invest in research and development in order to develop cost saving technology. In relatively free market economies, the opportunity and motivation for technological advances are created by competition, freedom of choice, self-interest and the fact that monetary rewards for new products and production techniques accrue directly to the innovators. Market forces, therefore, encourage extensive use and rapid development of new technology. In the absence of market forces the motivation for efficient use of resources and technological advances is weak; it must come through the directive of the central plan.<br>However, the government must intervene where market forces fail to achieve efficient use of resources and limiting growth and development.<br>So far as reliance on economic theory to achieve high growth is concerned, it has been a subject of debate among economists and economic managers. The proponents argue that by pursuing economic principles the economic direction of an economy is set right to finally achieve the ultimate goal of sustainable growth and development. They argue that theories such as utility, price and wage determination, profit maximization and social efficiency can help to achieve higher levels of growth by promoting efficient use of scarce resources. Hence, economic theories provide important ingredients for economic well being. However, the opponents believe that economic theory can be of little help for achieving the goal of material benefits. They question the practical value of these theories and believe that the static nature of economic theory is far from real dynamic situations. For instance, economic theory predicts certain behaviour of various marginal values-and suggests all decision making on the basis of these values. Critics argue that it is not possible to measure marginal values precisely and furthermore, the pattern of various marginal values predicted by the theories are usually contrary to the real world situation. <br>However, all agree that most economic theories provide ideal type that may be far from reality yet they provide basis, to understand the real world situation and give useful guidelines to formulate policies that are suitable to the given situation.</li>

<li>Labour is the effort, both physical and mental, made by human being in production. By the supply of labour we mean the number of hours of work offered. The total supply of labour to a market depends on the price of labour i.e. wage rate, the size of the population, the age composition of the population, the labour force participation rate, the occupational and geographical mobility&nbsp;of the labour force and the tendency of labour force in terms of trade off between work and leisure.&nbsp;<br><br>The wage rate is all important in determining the supply of labour. We first begin by deriving the supply curve of labour for an individual worker and then extend our analysis to market supply of labour. <br><br>The individual's supply curve of labour is backward bending. This means that after a certain wage rate, higher wages will result in fewer hours being worked per day, with individuals demanding more leisure time as shown in fig. below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/186b4345ff01b37eff9a25078e8cdf10" alt="" width="415" height="249"><br>The backward bending supply curve can be analysed by applying income and substitution effect. Substitution effect of a rise in wages on number of working hours is positive whereas income effect is negative. At low wage rate substitution effect outweighs income effect resulting in up sloping supply curve but when income effect offsets substitution effect, higher wages can lead to less hours worked and a backward bending supply curve. <br><br>The industry's supply curve of labour is obtained by the horizontal summation of the supply curves of individual workers and it will normally be positively sloped. Thus, the supply of labour in a particular market can be expanded by increasing the wage offered. This will attract labour of the same or of a nearly similar kind from other industries, occupations, and localities. The extent to which quantity supplied changes depends on occupational and geographical mobility of labour<br><br>However, the position of the market supply curve of labour will depend on the number of people willing and able to do the job at each given wage rate. This in turn depends on three factors: <br><br>Firstly, any changes in the number of qualified people for a certain occupation results in a change in supply of labour. Secondly, the benefits and costs of the job such as the pleasantness or otherwise of the working environment, job satisfaction or dissatisfaction, status, power, the degree of job security, holidays, perks and other fringe benefits also alter the position of supply curve. Thirdly, the wages and non-wage benefits in alternative jobs can change the position of the supply of labour curve. For instance, the higher the job-attractiveness in an occupation the greater the supply of labour. Alternatively, higher wages and attractive benefits offered in other similar industries will reduce the supply of labour in an occupation. <br><br>Trade unions are made up of groups of workers who share the same interest. Their aims can range from increasing the wage rate to improving the working environment or taking up the case of those who the trade unions see as being unfairly treated. A trade union may be significantly strong to restrict the supply of labour by lengthening the time it takes to complete apprenticeship or by restricting membership and have closed shop agreements preventing non-members from being employed. However, in a situation of open shop a union is weak and cannot influence the supply of labour. Thus, the ability of a trade union to limit the supply of labour is detrimental to certain factors such as union friendly legislation, its ability to control employment contracts and most importantly the size of its membership relative to the total market supply of labour. <br><br>Hence, it can be stated that mere existence of trade unions is not the main factor that affects the supply of labour, rather it depends on the relative strength rendered to them by legislation and the size of their membership.</li>
<li>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive labour market, so the economic theory goes, wage rate is determined by the demand for and supply of labour. Many firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type of labour characterize this type of market. Also, there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge, perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers. <br><br>The total, or market, labor demand curve is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves (the marginal revenue product curves) of the individual firms. The marginal revenue product, MRP<sub>L</sub>, is the increase in revenue due to employing one more unit of labour. MRP<sub>L</sub> is determined by the MPP<sub>L</sub> (marginal physical product of labour) multiplied by the MR i.e .<br>MRP<sub>L</sub> = MPP<sub>L</sub> x MR. <br><br>On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6a93492eb4537add1f225d8e322311d1" alt="" width="386" height="187"><br><br>In the figure above the equilibrium wage rate and level of employment are determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves. Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this type of labor up to the point at which marginal revenue product (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is equal to marginal resource cost (MC<sub>L</sub>).&nbsp;<br><br>However, labour markets are likely to contain imperfections, for instance, there may be a single buyer of laboura monopsonist. If this is the case, then the monopsonist will be facing upward sloping market supply curve and hence in order to recruit additional workers it has to offer a higher wage rate. This is illustrated in the figure below: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/6304c5a0cd73c68a3469e656ef4e60f9" alt="" width="300" height="216"><br>The marginal cost curve for labour (MC<sub>L</sub>) being above the average cost curve for labour (AC<sub>L</sub>) can be explained by the use of a simple example. At a wage rate of £ 100, 50 workers may be employed. If, however, the monopsonist wishes to employ one more worker he or is forced to offer £101, the increase being paid to all workers. The average cost is now £ 101&nbsp;but the marginal cost is £ 151, comprising of £ 101 paid to the 51 st worker plus £ 1 paid to each of the 50 original workers. <br><br>The monopsonist, being a profit maximiser, will employ where the MC<sub>L</sub> is equal to the MRP<sub>L</sub>, i.e. point A, hence L<sub>1</sub> workers will be employed. The wage rate, however, is given by the average cost curve S (AC<sub>L</sub>) and this will be W<sub>1</sub>. The overall wage bill to the monopsonist will, therefore, be OW<sub>1</sub>B<sub>L1.</sub>&nbsp;In a perfectly competitive non-monopsony market the wage and numbers being employed would have been W<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> respectively. <br><br>Trade unions seek to increase the wage rate of their members by either restricting the supply of labour (explained in part a) or by direct negotiation. Collective bargaining involves wage negotiation between trade unions, acting on behalf of their members, and the employers. Successful bargaining could raise the wage rate, as illustrated in figure below:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/11cddd4b6b5a81ae7d4d2090f1c170fa" alt="" width="285" height="200"><br><br>The monopsonist facing a large number of employees in the industry will force the wage rates down to OW<sub>2</sub> and restrict employment to L<sub>1</sub>. The entry of a trade union to the industry, which sets a minimum wage of W<sub>3</sub>, will kink the supply curve of labour and produce a discontinuity in the marginal cost curve of labour. <br><br>The monopsonist has a profit incentive to hire extra workers so long as the marginal revenue product of labour, shown by the demand curve, is greater than the marginal cost of labour. Hence, it will employ L<sub>2</sub> workers.<br><br>Following a union forced wage rise, not only do the workers get a higher wage, but the monopsonist employer actually employs more workers. It is only when the union forces the wage rate above W<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;that employment starts to fall. <br><br>The bargaining strength of trade unions when dealing with employers depends on a number of factors. For instance, a trade union will be in a better bargaining position when it is not easy for employer to substitute labour with capital and the elasticity of demand for the product that the firm produces is relatively low. Also, the low proportion of labour costs out of the total costs, majority of the workers belong to the union and most importantly suitable political and economic climate will add to their bargaining strength. On the other hand high price elasticity of demand for the product, possibility of labour substitution with capital, high proportion of labour costs to total cost , low profits and a period of high unemployment will weaken their power. <br><br>To sum up, the introduction of trade unions is deemed to change the analysis of wage determination but the extent to which changes have to be made is subject to the collective bargaining strength of trade unions.</li>

Many actions of firms may seem to conflict with this aim and yet could be consistent with economic explanation. At the outset, we deal with the first part of the statement of charging a price that covers costs.</p>
<p>When considering costs it is important to distinguish between the short run and long run. In the short run some costs, namely fixed costs, also called overheads or unavoidable costs, include rent, interest payments and hire purchase repayments. These costs have to be paid even if there is no output produced. Variable costs include payment for raw materials and wages for example. At zero output, variable costs are zero and they rise as output increases. However, in the long run all costs become variable costs.</p>
<p>According to economic theory, in the short run, the firm may continue production if price charged does not cover its average fixed costs. This is because the firm will have to pay its fixed costs even if it produces nothing. It is only when price does not cover average variable costs that the firm stops production. However, in the long run the firm quits if the price charged is below its per unit costs (AC). Hence, pricing to cover costs depends on the time period in consideration.</p>
<p>Also, policies to increase the size of the firm or the firm's share of the market may involve heavy advertising or low prices to the detriment of equating price with the costs. Nevertheless, if this results in the firm becoming larger, with the growing share of the market, the resulting economic power may enable the firm to charge a price consistent with its costs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not all firms operate with this objective; there is provision in economic theory for alternative aims. For instance, firms in difficult time price their product with the objective of survival and may be prepared to bear loss for the time being. Some other firms may not pursue the objective of profit maximization at all and aim to achieve some alternative objectives such as social welfare. In some cases, government deliberately provides subsidies to the producers of certain products with the aim of improving allocation of resources. In that case, firms may be charging the price below their costs and this is allowed in theory.</p>
<p>Thus it can be concluded that economic theory is flexible and does provide explanation for a number of alternative pricing policies including the policy of charging a price where firm covers its costs.</p>
<p>Now we address the second part of the statement related to allocative efficiency. According to the principle, the economy is efficient when it allocates right amount of scarce resources to produce right products. Allocative efficiency deemed to exist when the price of the product is equal to its marginal cost of production i.e. P = MC Or MB(MU) = MC</p>
<p>According to economic theory any economic activity, for example, production or consumption, should be expanded as long as marginal benefits exceed marginal costs and should be reduced if marginal costs are greater than marginal benefits. The optimal amount of the activity occurs where MB = MC.</p>
<p>Consider an example of compact discs (CD). As we know that the opportunity costs (MC) of additional units of CD will rise as more units are produced. This can be shown with an upward sloping MC curve, as given in the figure below. We are also aware of the fact that we obtain diminishing marginal benefits (MB) from additional units of CD. Therefore, the second unit of a CD yields less additional utility (MU) or benefit (MB) than the first. And a third will provide even less MB than the second. Therefore, we can portray the marginal benefits from CD with a downward sloping MB curve, as shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>The optimal quantity of CD production is indicated by the intersection of the MB and MC curves: 200,000 units in the figure above. To prove this consider, If only 100,000 CDs were produced, the marginal benefit of CD would exceed its marginal cost (MB&gt;MC). In money terms, MB might be $15, while MC is only $5. This suggests that society would be under-allocating resources to CD production; more of it should be produced.</p>
<p>Since society values an additional CD as being worth $15, while the alternative products which the required resources could produce are worth only $5. Society benefits-it is better off in the sense that it can enjoy, something worth $15 by forgoing something worth only. $5. Net gains can be realized until CD production increased to 200,000. A reallocation of resources from other products to CD would mean society is using its resources more efficiently. Each additional CD up to 200,000 would improve allocative efficiency. But when MB = MC, the benefit of producing CD or alternative products with the available resources are equal, i.e. allocative efficiency is achieved.</p>
<p>The production of 300,000 CD would represent an overallocation of resources. Here the MC of CD is $15 and MB is $5 (MB&lt;MC). At this level a CD is worth only $5 for society whereas the alternative product to which the resources could produce are valued at $15. Therefore, society gains something worth $15 by forgoing something worth $5. Net gains can be realized until CD production can be reduced to 200,000.</p>
<p>Hence resources are being efficiently allocated to any product when its output is such that its marginal benefit equals its marginal cost (MB = MC).</p>
<p>The pricing policy suggested by Namabian government would ensure allocative efficiency but does not guarantee social efficiency. In order to achieve social efficiency resource allocation must take place where marginal social benefits are equal to marginal social costs (MSB = MSC). In other words, in the absence of market failure MB = MC results in general pareto optimality. But in certain cases, the most obvious of them are merit and demerit goods and externalities, MB = MC fails to achieve optimum use of scarce resources. For instance, in the presence of externalities MSB exceed MPB or MSC are higher than MPC. Hence, MB = MC results in overallocation of resources when negative externalities exceed positive externalities and underallocates resources when positive externalities exceed negative externalities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, charging a price that covers costs results in allocative efficiency but does not necessarily ensure socially optimal level of output.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 288</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8542</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>The North Sea oil industry<br></strong></p>
<p>The UK drills for oil in the North Sea. In 1999, production was at 4.5 million barrels a day. However, as the oil in the easily accessible oil fields was used up, production fell steadily from 1999 until it reached 3.3 million barrels a day in 2005.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in 2006, many in the oil industry did not consider it to be in decline. Indeed, some of the industry's problems were associated with an expanding industry, not a declining one. The managers complained, for example, about the shortage of skilled Jabour and the high rents of the oil rigs. Investment increased by 30% in 2006 and it was hoped that production would rise in 2007.</p>
<p>The UK government was keen to keep production high as the industry supported 250 000 jobs and had a large impact on the trade balance of the UK. One way to keep production high is to explore for new oil fields. Another way is to use every drop of oil from the existing oil fields. Sometimes a large company leaves an oil field which still has substantial amounts of oil because although it is technically possible to extract the oil, it is not profitable to do so. However, a smaller company is often able to drill profitably for the oil when it is unprofitable for a large company.</p>
<p>In view of this, the UK government encouraged smaller and more enterprising firms. In 2005, 152 licences to drill were given to 99 companies. These new licences gave companies exclusive rights to develop the more inaccessible oil fields for six years rather than four years as before. Furthermore, the government also changed the rules on access to pipelines - which are often owned by large companies - so that smaller companies could get their oil to the market more easily.<br>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Minister of Finance) also made changes. In 2002, he raised the tax on oil company profits to 40% from the usual company rate of 30%, and raised it again in 2005 to 50%. The justification given was that the oil companies made huge profits.</p>
<p>The industry is more dependent than ever on large expensive technological advances and innovation. Most of the government's reforms recognised this.</p>

<li>How might the North Sea oil industry have an impact on the national income of the UK?</li>
<li>From the information given, consider whether the North Sea oil industry appears to be declining or expanding.</li>
<li>What evidence is there that might explain why the North Sea oil industry is still prepared to increase investment?</li>
<li>Discuss whether the increase in the number of small firms drilling for oil contradicts the usual economic explanation of the existence of small firms.</li>
</ol></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>National income is the monetary value of the flow of goods and services becoming available to a nation during one-year time. Not surprisingly, North Sea oil bonanza might have had a major impact on the national income of the UK. The facts that the industry supported 250 000 jobs and had an increase in the level of investment by 30% must have generated substantial amount of income leading to even higher spending. This rising spending might have encouraged firms to employ more workers and other resources resulting in even more incomes being paid out to household and in return an increase in consumption yet again. The process might have led to a massive increase in both spending and investment, subsequently resulting in an increase in NY. Furthermore, reduction in imported oil due to the increasing use of home produced oil or possibly export of oil amid rising prices in international market might have had a positive effect on the national income of the UK.<br><br></li>
<li>The fact that the oil companies made huge profits and the level of investment increased by 30 %, clearly favour the view of expanding industry. Similarly, the UK government encouraging smaller and more enterprising firms and on going technological advances should also result in an increase in the number of firms and hence output and employment in the industry. In addition, the increasing number of jobs, shortages of skilled labour and high rents of oil rigs are all signs of expansion. However, increase in investment and a considerable number of job creation may be for exploration, which may or may not result in expansion of output. <br><br>On the contrary, level of production falling from 4.5 million to 3.3 million barrels a day is a noticeable indicator of the declining state of the UK oil industry. Although, the text does not indicate yet it can be expected that the decrease in out put is only from the more accessible fields and the level of output may rise as firms drill oil from the reserve fields. Furthermore, it may be argued that the extra measures in support of the industry were required to boost new firms is primarily due to the declining state of the industry. <br><br>The information given in the text is inconclusive as none of the two views is supported convincingly by the facts. Although, the conclusion cannot be drawn with certainty yet it seems more likely that the industry would continue to expand.<br><br></li>
<li>As given in figure 1, the oil price, although fluctuated yet has shown an increasing trend from 1999 until 2005. There is a sharp increase in price, by approximately 70%, during the years 2004 and 2005 in particular. This continued rise in price might have made it even more profitable for the firms to invest in order to explore new oil fields or at least extract more oil from the existing fields. These swelling profits of the oil industry not only attracted new investment but also made the exchequer interested to increase the share of the treasury by increasing the tax rates. Moreover, the government altered regulation to make them more investor friendly. These lucrative incentives and expectations of successful exploration of new oil fields might have induced new investment. Also, the relatively small firms must have been encouraged to invest and earn their share of profits after the withdrawals of large companies from oil fields which still had substantial amounts of oil.<br><br></li>
<li>Small firms, as the theory goes, operate in those industries, which provide personal services, produce expensive luxury items and satisfy demand for variety products. In certain cases firms usually continue to operate at relatively smaller scale where the markets have been confined to fairly small regions. Some small firms exist because they supply standardised parts to larger firms. Oil industry shares none of the above-mentioned factors. Neither the oil industry provides personal services where the elements of personal attention required by the purchase is an important part of the product, nor does it face the demand for variety. On the contrary, the product that the industry produces is consumed worldwide and is not classified as a luxury item. Moreover, the industry requires huge investment to build infrastructure and for that it needs to employ large number of workers. <br><br>However, the large profits earned by the industry might have made it attractive even for small firms to invest and obtain their share of profits is the usual economic explanation of the existence of small firms. In addition, the support and encouragement rendered by the government to small firms can also be explained by the usual economic theory. Governments support small firms because they not only create employment but also provide necessary competition to large firms. Governments adopt various measures to assist small firms such as financial and technical support and most importantly tax rebates. Hence, the concessions given by the UK government to small firms is in accordance with the usual economic explanation. <br><br>In the text, there is some information that reflects economic explanation of increasing number of small firms in the oil industry but the large part of information cannot be explained by the usual economic theory.</li>

Tariffs can be levied across the board on all imported items or it can be targeted i.e. on selected items. A tariff can take the form of a specific tax, i.e. a lump sum tax, or it can be ad valorem, i.e. based on a percentage of the price of the imported items. Apart from raising the price of imports relative to domestic products, tariffs can also act as a source of revenue for the government. The diagram below shows the effect of introducing a tariff on a good in a previously unprotected market.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/4decf67d844fff2f4239dc6de67c27b4" alt="" width="430" height="224"></p>
<p>Let's assume that the world supply to the economy S<sub>w</sub> is perfectly elastic. Under these circumstances, price would fall to P<sub>w</sub>.&nbsp;At this low price, Q<sub>4</sub> is demanded but only Q<sub>1</sub> is supplied by domestic suppliers. Hence, the shortfall of q<sub>1</sub>-q<sub>4</sub> is made up by import.</p>
<p>If the government then imposes a tariff equal to P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>w</sub>, it has the effect of shifting the world supply curve to S<sub>w</sub> + tariff. The domestic price will now be P<sub>1</sub> and this will have the dual effect of reducing domestic demand to q<sub>3</sub> and increasing the amount domestic firms are willing to supply to q<sub>2</sub>. The desired outcome of the tariff will have been achieved, since imports of the product are now only q<sub>3</sub> - q<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Before tariff, consumer surplus was ACP<sub>w,</sub>&nbsp;while after the tariff the consumer surplus was reduced to ABP<sub>1</sub>. Part of this reduction in consumer surplus will go to the government in the form of tariff revenue and this can be represented by area 3, per unit tariff P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>w</sub> multiplied by the imported quantity q<sub>2</sub> - q<sub>3</sub>. The domestic producers of the product will obtain an increase in their producer surplus of area 1. This then leaves areas 2 and 4, which no party benefits from; they are a cost to society and are called net welfare losses.</p>
<p>As it can be seen from the graph that the tariff has reduced import penetration and therefore, would result in a fall in outflow of money. It also allows a breathing space for structural adjustment and raises revenue for the government. In addition, tariffs prove effective when the foreign firms are found dumping their products in order to gain market power.</p>
<p>With all the benefits tariffs may not be the first choice as they have other serious implications. Trade barriers in the form of tariffs push the prices faced by consumers up and insulate inefficient sectors from competition. They interfere with the operation of the market and encourage inefficient allocation of resources both domestically and globally. In general, tariffs impose costs on society that would not exist if there was completely free trade in goods and services.</p>
<p>It is often the case that the higher prices that result from tariffs hit those on lower incomes, hence, they may worsen the inequalities in the distribution of income making the allocation of scarce resources less equitable.</p>
<p>Finally, when one country imposes tariffs, the resultant decrease in total trade will have a negative multiplier effect influencing many more countries because exports are an injection of demand into the global circular flow of income. The negative multiplier effects are more pronounced when trade disputes boil over and lead to retaliation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, tariffs can be effective when deficit on current account is mainly caused by the deficit on trade balance and demand for imports is relatively elastic. They prove to be irrelevant when current account deficit is primarily the result of deficit on income and transfer flows and are ineffective and undesirable when price elasticity of demand for imports is low.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 290</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8539</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether a widespread shortage of labour might be a major cause of inflation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Inflation is defined as a persistent and generalized increase in the level of prices. The term persistent implies that average of all prices is rising year in and year out. Economists distinguish between two types of inflation: demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation. <br>Demand-pull inflation occurs when AD exceeds AS at current prices, thus leading to an increase in the price level. Demand-pull inflation is associated with full employment and the concept of inflationary gap. This can be explained as if the economy is at less than full employment, then an increase in AD can more easily be accommodated by an expansion in output with a limited effect on the price level. The real inflationary situation occurs when AD continues to expand once the position of full employment has been reached.<br>In outlining demand-pull inflation it has been assumed that the increase in AD has been the result of an increase in aggregate expenditure, such as government expenditure. This is, in fact, a Keynesian explanation of inflation. However, the increase in AD could have been the result of an increase in the money supply as Friedman put it "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" a monetarists explanation of inflation. <br>Cost-push inflation is associated with the supply side of the economy. According to the theory, rising prices can be explained in terms of factors which raise per unit production costs such as increase in wage costs, rise in the costs of raw material and energy, increasing rates of indirect taxes and growing import prices. Rising per unit costs squeeze profits and reduce the amount of output firms are willing to supply at the existing price level. As a result, the economy's supply of goods and services decreases and pushes the price level up. <br>Widespread shortage of workers would result in rising wages. If these wage gains are excessive relative to such offsetting factors as an increase in output per hour worked, then producers' per unit production costs rises. Consequently, AS curve shifts leftwards, causing average price level to rise, but due to the increase in money wages AD also increases and pulls the price level further upwards. Producers, in response to rising AD, would increase their demand for labour, and hence bid up the wage rate as they compete for available pool of labour that is already short in supply. In brief, the widespread shortage of labour would result in an inflationary spiral.<br>However, the impact of shortages of labour on general price level depends on substitutability of labour with capital. In those industries where role of labour in production can be replaced by introducing more automation, labour shortages will have little impact on the general price level if any. In other industries where the role of labour cannot be substituted with capital, persistent shortages of labour will continue to push the price level upwards. In addition, the problem of labour shortages can also be overcome by attracting labour from overseas, if possible, and hence the pressure on prices can be removed by increasing output. <br>Finally, in real world, a widespread shortage of labour seems unlikely to be the major cause of inflation. Other factors such as increase in money supply, rise in raw material prices, swelling indirect tax rates and growing AD causing an overheating in the economy, are more prevalent causes of inflation.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 291</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8538</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what determines the size of a country's labour force.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Labour force in an economy consists of all those eligible and available to work. In other words, those who are employed and those who are unemployed but actively seeking work are counted as being in the labour force.</p>
<p>In order to determine the size of labour force we exclude, from the total population, children under 16 years of age and people who are institutionalized, for instance, mentally retarded and prisoners. We also subtract the number of adults who are potential workers but are not seeking work for some reason such as homemakers, full&nbsp;time students and retired. The size of a country's labour force is determined by changes in demographic, economic, social and cultural factors.&nbsp;<br>In general, certain demographic trends influence the size of labour force in an economy. For instance, if in a country birth rate exceeds death rate or the number of immigration is larger than emigration, the total population and hence the labour force is expected to increase. On the other hand, a decrease in the size of population due to either negative growth rate of population or a trend of migration to other parts of the world tend to reduce the size of labour force.</p>
<p>Changes in the age composition of population also influence the size of working population. For instance, a rising proportion of aging population out of the total population reduces labour force, whereas increasing proportion of working age group is expected to increase the number of eligible workers who are willing to work.</p>
<p>The available labour force will also be affected by any statutory changes in the school leaving age and the retirement age. For instance, an increase in school leaving age from 16 to 17 years will have the effect of reducing the size of working population, as would a decrease in the age of retirement from 65 to 60 years. Similarly, a decrease in school leaving age or an increase in the retirement age would increase the size of labour force.</p>
<p>Recently, in many developed countries growth in labour force has slowed down and in some cases it has become negative mainly due to people opting for early retirements and also due to increase in the number of school leavers remaining in higher education. On the contrary, in some low income countries such as India, a growing desire among families to achieve higher standard of living has led to an increase in the number of individuals, in each family, willing to work.</p>
<p>In many far Eastern countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia the growing participation rate of female workers has led to an increase in labour force. This can be viewed as a result of positive change in society's attitude towards women at work, decline in birth rate and lower family size, higher educational attainment by women, greater use of labour saving home appliances and most importantly an increase in the opportunities of part time work or flexible timings.</p>
<p>Finally, a rise in the demand for labour and an accompanying increase in earnings will result in an increase in the proportion of the population willing to work. For instance, more married women and elderly people enter the labour force when the demand for labour is high. Similarly, the labour force tends to decrease when earnings and employment opportunities decline.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 292</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8537</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the price mechanism is an effective way to solve the basic economic problem.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The price mechanism is a term used to describe the means by which the many millions of decisions taken each day by consumers and businesses interact to determine the allocation of scarce resources among competing uses. Invisible hand of the price mechanism operates in a competitive market through the pursuit of self-interest to allocate scarce resources in society's best interest. This remains the essence of the ideology of free-market system.<br>In a free market economy with limited government involvement, price mechanism is the organizing force. It functions as a signal and an incentive for producers to act in the required way to maximise their gain, which, in turn, optimises the allocation of resources. <br>Everyone in this system is motivated by pure self-interest. Consumers maximise welfare, firms maximise profits and the private individuals aim to maximise the rewards of resources they own. It is argued that in doing so individuals will be guided as if by an 'invisible hand' to achieve maximum social welfare for the nation as a whole. <br>There is consumer sovereignty i.e. through price system, consumers indicate their wishes and community's productive resources are allocated accordingly. In addition, firms keep production costs as low as possible to obtain highest profit margin. Thus, allocative and productive efficiency will occur. <br>The government's role is to protect intellectual property rights through patents &amp; copyrights. Hence, there are incentives for firms to be innovative and produce better quality products. Firms also compete with each other on price and always be looking to produce something new to get ahead of their competitors. It is of no surprise, therefore, that consumers benefit from lower prices, better quality, and a much larger choice of goods and services. <br>However, the outcome of price mechanism is undesirable when markets malfunction. Market failure occurs when the signalling and incentive function of the price mechanism fails to operate optimally leading to a loss of economic and social welfare. For example, public goods such as streetlights cannot be provided privately because of their two characteristics, non-rivalry and non-excludability. These goods have to be provided publicly or else they will never be produced through price mechanism. Another failure occurs in case of merit and demerit goods. Consumer preferences to consume these goods and services may be based on imperfect information on the costs and benefits. Thus, merit goods, like health and education, tend to be under consumed and demerit goods, like cigarettes and alcohol are over provided.&nbsp;<br>Also, while responding to price mechanism individual producers base their production decisions on private rather than social costs. Therefore, the market may fail to take into account the external costs and benefits arising from production and consumption. Moreover, in some markets individual preferences may be distorted and shaped by the effects of persuasive advertising and marketing to create artificial wants and needs. <br>On top of these, the system may be judged as 'unfair' because there may be considerable inequalities in both income and wealth arising from the operation of price mechanism. Since the wages for labour are determined by the forces of demand and supply, therefore, all those who can afford and obtain better education or are blessed with particular talent, which is high in demand, will be able to command higher incomes and hence, larger share from the nation's output. Others may not be so fortunate and thus receive far lower incomes and comparatively a lower share from the nation's output. <br>Like any other system, the capacity of price mechanism to solve the problem of scarcity is limited. However, the system, by far, seems to be more effective in dealing with the problem yet its effectiveness depends on the degree of failure. <br>Overall, with all its merits, price mechanism does not solve the problem of scarcity but is considered effective in dealing with the problem when operating efficiently.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 293</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8536</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the three economic questions that all economies face because of the basic economic problem.&nbsp; [8]</p>

satisfy infinite wants. Wants include needs and desires to obtain and use various goods and services that provide satisfaction. Resources are typically called factors of production (land, labour, capital and entrepreneur) are all the inputs used in the production of those goods and services that we want. <br>Scarcity occurs among poor as well as rich people. It applies to all because there will never be enough of everything that people want at zero price. Because of scarcity of productive resources, output itself is limited and society is not able to produce and consume all the goods and services it wants. Thus, choices have to be made. These choices involve the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses to achieve given ends. No matter what the economic system, the problem of scarcity must be addressed and in doing so every economic system faces opportunity cost in decision making. <br>Owing to scarcity, all societies, following any economic system, must address the basic questions of what, how and for whom to produce to finalise their choices.</p>
<ol>
<li>What to produce? Given that resources are not enough to produce all commodities people want to consume. Society has to decide what mix of commodities to produce and in what quantities. For example, whether to construct new roads or hospitals, produce cars or tanks, and in what quantities each of the commodities should be produced.</li>
<li>How to produce? The nation also has to decide what methods of production to adopt in order to produce maximum possible quantities from scarce resources of all commodities that it chooses to produce. In other words, what combination of resources are going to be used and in what quantities those resources should be used? For example, whether to use relatively greater amount of capital compared to labour (capital intensive) or use relatively larger quantity of labour compared to capital (labour intensive).</li>
<li>How to distribute? This question focuses upon the distribution of the economy's output. Since resources are scarce and so are commodities therefore not everything can be produced for everyone. On a broad level the nation needs to decide whether everyone is going to have an equal share of what is produced or some will have more than others. In a market economy the decisive factor is individuals' incomes. For instance, those with higher incomes obtain a larger share from the nation's output.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the term scarcity indicates the excess of human wants over what can actually be produced to fulfill these wants.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 294</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8535</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p><strong>The appreciation of the Zambian Kwacha<br></strong></p>
<p>Zambia's currency, the Kwacha, experienced a significant appreciation in the year up to March 2006. This is shown in Fig. 1. Factors that influenced the exchange rate at this time were an improvement in Zambia's export performance, a reduction in the foreign debt owed by Zambia, an increase in foreign aid received by Zambia and an inflow of foreign investment. The exchange rate is vitally important for Zambia because its exports of copper, tobacco, maize and cotton are priced in US$ but its costs are paid in Zambian Kwacha.</p>

<li>November</li>
<li>It appreciated by approximately 1000 K wacha.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The rate of exchange is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. Rapid monthly exchange rate fluctuations shown in fig. l indicate that Zambia follows a free floating exchange rate system. For example, alone in the month of Aug. Kwacha appreciated by approximately 9% and then depreciated almost by the same percentage. The free floating exchange rate system is where market forces with no government intervention determining the exchange rate. The continuity of fluctuations in exchange rate, throughout the period, suggests that the external value of K wacha against the US$ is, therefore, determined by demand and supply.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Improvement in Zambian export performance might have led to an increase in both supply of foreign currency and demand for K wacha in the foreign exchange market. Demand for K wacha might have increased because the Zambian exporting firms, as mentioned in the text, are paid in foreign currency but the costs of inputs used in production are paid in K wacha. Hence, the exporting firms must exchange their receipts in foreign currency for kwacha in order to pay for the costs of exported items. This might have resulted in an appreciation of Zambian currency as shown in the diagram below.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/423805a2437b2e6578401ef0fb483ba5" alt="" width="397" height="216"><br>Rising demand for Kwacha from D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>2</sub> pushes the exchange rate from Er<sub>1</sub> to Er<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Foreign debt is owed to foreign citizens, firms, and institutions and hence to repay debt or interest the country needs foreign currency. In case of Zambia, a reduction in foreign debt might have led to a less need for the country to repay debt or interest. Consequently, demand for foreign currency and supply of K wacha must have fallen in the foreign exchange market, resulting in appreciation of K wacha as shown in the figure below: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/26349ba5dba672a89d8d479592daa2f7" alt="" width="417" height="229"><br>Fall in supply of Kwacha from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub> pushes the rate from Er<sub>1</sub> to Er<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The terms of trade (TOT) express the relationship between the price of imports and the price of exports. In real world the TOT are given by: <br>TOT &nbsp;= (Average price of exports)×100 / (Average price of imports )&nbsp;<br>A rise in the external value of Zambian currency would increase the $ price of Zambian commodities and lower the price of foreign goods in K wacha. Hence, appreciation of K wacha would improve Zambia's terms of trade and the country would be able to exchange a greater quantity of foreign goods for a given amount of exports.</li>
<li>Appreciation is the rise in free exchange rate of the domestic currency with foreign currencies. When a nation's currency appreciates, it takes less of that nation's currency to buy a single unit of some foreign currency. As a result prices of foreign goods in domestic currency tend to fall and ease out inflationary pressure if any. Also, the lower prices of foreign goods improve purchasing power of the people and reduce their cost of living. In addition, the nation benefits from appreciation in terms of foreign debt burden as interest payment and debt repayment in local currency will decrease. In general, appreciation of a country's currency reflects growing international confidence in the economy and the country may receive a larger part of international capital flows. <br>As mentioned earlier, appreciation causes import prices to fall and export prices to rise, hence, domestic consumers switch to imported goods and services while foreign consumers tum to their own country's products in preference to imports. Thus, we expect the volume of imports to rise and the volume of exports to fall and possibly resulting in a worsening of trade balance. Also, due to the decline in demand from both domestic and foreign purchasers, the local producers will face decreasing sales both at home and abroad. This will lead to lower output, growing unemployment and a decline in growth rate. However, the extent to which appreciation affects the volume change depends on the price elasticity of demand for both imports and exports.</li>

In addition to these governments also aim at achieving high degree of efficiency in the use of nation's scarce resources and a fairly acceptable level of distribution of income and wealth. Though not all governments will share these objectives, yet it is also true that there will be trade-offs and potential conflicts between the objectives, and different governments will attach differing priorities to them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low unemployment<br></strong>It is important to keep unemployment levels as low as possible. High unemployment is expensive for the government and, therefore, for the taxpayer. For every unemployed person, there are two costs to the government. First, the unemployed workers will be entitled to benefit. Secondly, there is the less obvious cost of the loss of tax revenues, both from direct and indirect taxes, which the workers would have paid in work. Then there is the cost to the whole economy as unemployment involves a loss of potential output and hence lower living standard in general. Young unemployed workers may inflict other external costs on the society, crime for example.</li>
<li><strong>Price stability<br></strong>Control of inflation is important because if inflation gets out of control, the economy stops growing. The authorities are forced to raise interest rates to counter inflation. At higher interest rate consumers stop borrowing to spend and firms also reduce borrowing to&nbsp;invest. Exports become less competitive and the economy may well drop into a recession. Also periods of high inflation cause redistribution of income from savers to borrowers. Economists do not like this income distortion because it discourages savings as, over the longer term, the amount of investment in an economy is closely related to the amount of saving.&nbsp;<strong><br> </strong></li>
<li><strong>High but sustainable economic growth<br></strong>Economic growth is a measure of rate of change of real GDP over a period of time. High rate of growth can be achieved by bringing unemployed resources at work or alternatively, by improving productivity of existing resources. Governments seek to achieve high but sustainable growth rate mainly because it leads to improved living standards and economic stability.</li>
<li><strong>Balance of payments in equilibrium<br></strong>BOP is a summary of all economic transactions of a country with other nations over one year time period. BOP consists of all transactions relating to the exchange of visible goods such as various consumer and manufacturing items, exchange of invisibles and investment earnings such as services, profit and interest payments. It also records money inflows in terms of borrowing and foreign investment and money outflows as lending and investment abroad. A persistent BOP deficit initially results in a decline of a nation's foreign currency reserves and a run on its exchange rate. Ultimately, it necessitates borrowing and the country accumulates foreign debts which have to be repaid with interest in future. The ideal situation represents a position where, at least over a number of years, the nation spends and invests abroad no more than other nations spend or invest Ill it.</li>
<li><strong>Equity<br></strong>Left to market forces, owners of inputs, who are paid for their services, will receive significantly larger share of the cake of national income and better life chances than their retired, unemployed, disabled and underprivileged counterparts. Governments seek to redistribute income through progressive taxation and various types of welfare payments.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency<br></strong>Any situation in which the unrestrained market system causes too few or too many resources to be allocated to a specific economic activity can be stated as an example of inefficiency such as, spillover effects (externalities) of many economic activities or market forces unable to provide public goods. Governments seek to eliminate inefficiencies to maximize output from scarce resources.&nbsp;<br><br>The nature of these policy objectives is such that they conflict with each other. There exist potential conflicts not only in macro economic objectives but also between macro and micro economic objectives. There are, therefore, possible trade-offs between the key policy objectives and it is rare for any government to be able to meet all its objectives at the same time. The complexity of the economy and the limitations of economic policies make this a really tough task! Therefore the government of the present day has to choose from these objectives and try to achieve them on priority basis. The order of priority depends on the current economic situation and the political ends of the government in office.&nbsp;<br><br>The proposed objectives in the question are low unemployment and low tax rates. Low unemployment is a standard objective of government economic policy whereas, at least, according to economic theory in practice, low tax rate is considered as one of the tools of government policy for achieving low unemployment, therefore, the two compliment each other and can be achieved as a pair. <br><br>Present political governments, in order to remain politically popular, usually give priority to high growth and low unemployment in pair. But they use low rate of taxation as policy instrument to achieve them. The governments seeking low unemployment by reducing tax rates are thus faced with a dilemma. If they reduce tax rates, they will be able to achieve growth and low unemployment, but it can proved to be inflationary and can worsen balance of payments. If they increase the tax rate, it is the other way round: inflation and balance of payments will improve, but unemployment will rise and growth or even output will fall. The situation becomes more complex when high growth and low unemployment result in higher negative externalities, concentration of market power or possibly widening gap between rich and poor. <br><br>In theory, at least, the choice depends on the current state of the economy. For example, in times of economic recession the priority objectives should be the highest possible growth and lowest rate of unemployment but with maintaining low rate of inflation, sacrificing minimum on balance of payments and keeping environmental hazards to the lowest possible. On the other hand in times when inflation accelerates, BOP deteriorates and more environmental damages are made, then corrections of these variables, again by sacrificing minimum of growth rate and employment, ought to be the priority of the government. <br><br>In conclusion, the order of priority that these objectives are given depends on the current economic situation and the government in office. But all governments in all nations ultimately desire these same objectives in their quest for economic stability.</li>

<li>Of the world's population of approximately 7 billion people in 2008; more than 85 % live in the developing countries and less than 15 % in the developed nations. <br><br>There are basically three factors which determine the size of population: birth rate, death rate and migration patterns. If birth rate exceeds death rate there is a natural increase in population. Similarly if the difference between immigration and emigration is positive the country's population increases. <br><br>The current population explosion has been caused by the number of births exceeding the number of deaths particularly in developing countries. Both birth and death rates are strikingly different between the two groups of countries. Birth rates in developing countries are generally very high, on the order of 30 to 40 per 1,000, whereas those in the developed countries are less than 15 per 1,000. <br><br>This higher birth rate in developing countries is mainly due to lack of awareness, early marriages and the tradition of large family size. Whereas in developed countries birth rate has been on the decline due to awareness and easy availability of contraceptive. Also majority of women in these countries are career oriented and they get married at relatively older age. <br><br>Death rates (the yearly number of deaths per 1,000 population) in developing countries are also high relative to the developed nations, but thanks to improved health conditions and modem vaccination campaigns against malaria, smallpox, yellow fever, and cholera as well as the proliferation of public-health facilities, clean water supplies, improved nutrition, and public education have all worked together over the past three decades to lower death rates by as much as 50% in parts of Asia and Latin America and by over 30% in much of Africa and the Middle East. <br><br>However in some developing countries death rates have failed to drop further, largely because of widespread poverty and more recently because of AIDS epidemic. Moreover, the continuance of high birth rates causes overall population growth rates to remain relatively high. <br><br>However the differences in death rate between developed and developing countries are substantially smaller than the corresponding differences in birth rates. A major element in the decline in the death rate has been the decline in infant mortality rate. This has decreased due to better ante-natel and post-natel care and improved medical techniques. Until birth rates are equal to death rates in developing countries, their population will continue to grow.<br>In the developed world , birth rates now roughly equal death rate. So that there is no population growth. In fact the population in some developed countries such as Germany is actually declining. As a result, the average rate of population growth is now about 1.6% per year in developing countries, compared to population growth of 0.7%-per year in the high income countries.<br><br>Net international migration is of negligible, though growing importance today. This flow of migration is mostly from developing countries to developed countries. Hence, increasing the size of population of developed countries. However population increases in developing countries entirely depends on the difference between their birth and death rates. <br><br>Finally the population growth rates are expected to be higher in developing countries than developed countries.</li>
<li>Urbanisation is the shift of population from the countryside into the towns. History documented unprecedented movements of people from the rural countryside to the bustling cities over the past few decades. According to economists there is a positive relationship between urbanization and per capita income. Generally, the more developed the country, measured by per capita income, the greater the share of population living in urban areas.<br><br>This widespread migration of people from rural areas into cities was regarded by economists as beneficial. It was argued that cities offer cost reducing advantages and numerous economic and social externalities, for example, skilled workers, cheap transport, social and cultural amenities. To a large degree, they argue, cities are formed because they provide these cost advantages to producers and consumers. These economies are benefits gained by particular sectors of the economy such as finance or automobiles, as they grow within an area. For example, when transportation costs are significant, users of the output of an industry may benefit from a nearby location to save on these costs. In addition, firms of the same or related industries may benefit from being located in the same city, so they can all draw on large pool of workers with the specific skills, or from specialized infrastructure. Workers with specialized skills appropriate to the industry prefer to be located there as well, so they can easily find a new job or take advantage of new opportunities. Further, firms wish to operate for the marketing advantages where consumers of their goods may shop in larger number. <br><br>However, massive urbanization, particularly in developing countries has led to heavy social costs. For example, overloading of housing and social services, increased crime, pollution and congestion tend to outweigh these urban advantages. These costs are of such magnitude that any economies of locating in urban areas have been dwarfed by them. The rapid population growth has far outpaced the growth of human and physical infrastructure needed for efficient economic life. In the city, migrants contribute to the already difficult environmental and social pressures. <br><br>Rural urban migration was once viewed favourably in alleviating poverty. It was thought that urbanization withdraws surplus labour from rural sector to provide needed manpower for urban industrial growth. The process was deemed socially beneficial as workers in rural areas engage in low productivity occupations with modest earnings, whereas in urban areas their labour could be transferred into higher productivity manufacturing and service sector jobs with higher earnings. Thus will help reduce poverty.&nbsp;<br><br>In contrast to this viewpoint, it is now clear from recent experience of developing countries that rates of rural urban migration continue to exceed rates of urban job creation and to surpass the absorption capacity of both industry and urban social services. No longer is urbanization viewed as a main source of alleviating poverty. <br><br>In conclusion, urbanization results in cost saving advantages and hence reduction in poverty but an out of proportion rural urban migration outweighs any economic benefits arising due to urbanization.</li>

<li>Government attempts to manipulate its budget deficit and surplus to achieve economic goals are called fiscal policy. If the budget announced is in deficit, then planned government expenditure will be greater than the government's estimated revenue and there will be a need to finance the deficit through borrowing, hence the need for the Public Sector Net Debt (PSND). If the budget is in surplus, then estimated revenue is greater than planned government expenditure and the surplus can be used to repay previous years' borrowing. It could also be the case that there is a balanced budget. In this situation estimated revenue would be equal to planned government expenditure. <br><br>A budget deficit is used as part of fiscal policy in order to stimulate aggregate demand in the economy as a means of achieving full employment and higher growth rate. In order to achieve this government spends more or cut taxes or both. A budget surplus is used as part of fiscal policy in order to dampen aggregate demand in the economy as a means of improving trade balance and stabilizing prices. In order to achieve this government spends less or increases taxes or both. <br><br>If government expenditure on goods and services such as roads, health care and education, etc. is raised, this will create a full multiplied rise in national income. The reason is that all gets spent and thus all of it goes to boosting aggregate demand. <br><br>Multiplier is the number of times by which a rise in income exceeds the rise in injection (J). Numerically the size is measured by the reciprocal of marginal propensity to withdraw (mpw). <br><br>K = 1/mpw &nbsp; &nbsp; Where MPL = MPS + MPT + MPM<br><br>MPS, MPT and MPM represent marginal propensity to save, marginal propensity to tax and marginal propensity to imports. The sum of these is MPL. It is the proportion of an increase in NY that is withdrawn from the circular flow. <br><br>The higher the amount of withdrawals the lower is the multiplier effect. <br><br>To illustrate the multiplier process we assume: it is a 4-sector economy with households, firms, government and foreign trade. There are unemployed resources. All citizens have a marginal propensity to save of 0.2, marginal propensity to import is 0.2 and marginal propensity to tax is 0.1.This means that out of every $100 earned, $50 will be leaked away. Next, we shall assume that the economy is in equilibrium. <br><br>Finally, government spends $200m. The impact of this on NY is given in the table below: <br><br>

<br>When government spends $200m, the economy will start off work and produce goods and services worth $200m. The factors of production that earn these $200m will spend $100m of it on other goods and services. The withdrawal in the first round of production were $40m of savings, $40m of imports and $20m&nbsp;of tax. The process continues until the increased withdrawals equal the earlier injection of $200m. <br><br>The process can be summarized by:<br>MPS + MPT + MPM = 0.5, &nbsp; &nbsp; so M=1/0.5<br>&nbsp;ΔY = ΔJ&nbsp;× k&nbsp; → $200m&nbsp;× 2= $400m<br><br>Multiplier works in both directions. An increase in initial spending can create a multiple increase in NY, or a decrease in government expenditure can be multiplied into a larger decrease in NY. <br><br>Cutting taxes by $200 million will have a smaller effect on national income than raising government expenditure on goods and services by $200 million. The reason is that not all the tax cuts will be passed on round the circular flow of income as extra expenditure. <br><br>In conclusion, the tax multiplier is smaller than the government expenditure multiplier. To achieve a given change in income through changes in tax would require a bigger deficit or surplus than if it were achieved through increased government expenditure.<br><br></li>
<li>Government uses a budget deficit to shift the aggregate demand curve rightward i.e. to stimulate spending and expand real output. This policy involves increases in government spending, reduction in taxes or some combination of the two. Fiscal policy advocates point out that a budget deficit would stimulate the economy, bringing growth and reduced unemployment as shown in the following graph:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4407bd774edc52dff88920fc80325346" alt="" width="468" height="240"><br>Figure above shows an economy in which, initially, expenditure is insufficient to buy all of potential output. Real income Y<sub>1</sub> can be produced by fewer people than are actually seeking work. There is some cyclical, or demand-deficiency, unemployment. <br><br>If expenditure can be increased then real income and output can expand and employers will take on more labour. The implication of there being unemployed resources is that aggregate supply can expand to meet any increase in aggregate demand . The new equilibrium real income Y<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>is achieved when aggregate expenditure, C+ I + G<sub>1</sub> + x - m, is exactly equal to real income and output. <br><br>It is important to notice that the eventual increase in income and output is much larger than the initial increase in government spending. This is precisely what we would expect, with the multiplier at work. It means that it is important for the government to be able to predict the multiplier effect of its change in spending. Otherwise it might prove to be highly inflationary and create the reverse problem. <br>However, it is important to remember that this policy works with a time lag. It can be one to two years before the effects of extra spending on the economy are visible. <br><br>An alternative possibility would have been to reduce taxes. This would increase disposable income and therefore consumption. Both increasing spending and decreasing taxes serve to increase the level of the government's deficit so that injections increase in relation to leakages. <br><br>If all goes well then a budget deficit enhances AD and hence reduces unemployment and increases real national output. It does not only bring short term growth in an economy that operates below its potential output, but can also pave the way to boost investment in the long run. <br><br>These expansionary effects of budget deficit on the economy depends on the method used to finance the deficit. There are two ways the government can finance a deficit: borrowing from the public by selling interest-bearing bonds with the help of its monetary authorities, or issuing new money to its creditors. The impact of each method on aggregate demand is different: <br><br>If the government enters the money market and borrows, it will compete with private business borrowers for funds. This added demand for funds might drive up the interest rate and crowd out some private investment&nbsp;spending and interest-sensitive consumer spending. Declines in private spending reduce the expansionary impact of the deficit spending. Also this new borrowing will add to already outstanding national debt, which may become increasingly difficult to service i.e. payment of interest on the debt, and may force the government to reduce its spending on subsidies and welfare payments. <br><br>If the government finances its deficit spending by obtaining newly created money from its monetary authorities, the crowding out of private spending can be avoided. Since creation of new money increases money supply and reduces interest rate, therefore, it is more expansionary but potentially more inflationary way of financing deficit spending than borrowing. <br><br>A budget deficit may also have adverse effects on balance of payment. Increasing government spending and cut in taxes result in an increase in disposable income and hence higher imports. The resulting change in imports however largely depends on the level of marginal propensity to import (mpm). A country with no trade restrictions, higher mpm and fixed exchange rate mechanism will face a larger balance of payment deficit as a consequence of budget deficit. <br><br>Finally a budget deficit as part of fiscal policy may have positive effects on growth, employment and investment. But there are certain causes of concern such as rising inflation, higher interest rate, balance of payment deficit and growing national debt. The success of the policy lies in accurately forecasting the desired effects on output, employment, inflation and the balance of payment of any increase in aggregate demand due to a deficit budget.</li>

Real GNP is a monetary measure of economic activity generated from all national resources both at home and abroad minus the rate of inflation. Real GNP per head is calculated by the following formula:</p>
<p>RGP / (Total population ) = RGNP per head</p>
<p>RGNP per capita is a measure of how much of real goods and services is available to the average citizen for consumption and investment. It is widely held that there should be a strong positive correlation between RGNP per capita and economic well being; that is, greater production should move society toward" the good life". Therefore economists view levels and rates of growth of "real" per capita GNP, expressed in common currency, as a useful indicator of comparing economic well being internationally.</p>
<p>The critics of RGNP per head argue that income distributions between the two countries may be different also national income accounts will have varying degrees of inaccuracy, caused, for instance, by different sizes of the informal economy in each country. The black economy includes any economic activity that goes unrecorded. The non-monetised sectors of the economy include output that is not sold at market prices but involves barter trade, and self-consumed products. The Economist's latest estimates for the total value of the black economy throughout the world is $9 trillion. The scale of the underground economy is estimated to average 15% of national output for rich economies and 33% of national output for emerging economies. According to their survey, Nigeria and Thailand have the world's largest black economies, both accounting for more than 70% of their official GDP.</p>
<p>National income accounting conventions may also be different in different countries, making it impossible to compare the two.</p>
<p>There is also the problem of what rate of exchange to use when comparing one country's national income with another. The day to day market exchange rate can bear little relation to relative prices in different countries. So prices in some countries, like Switzerland or West Germany, can be much higher at official exchange rates than in France or Italy. Therefore if national income statistics are to be used to compare living standards between countries it is important to use an exchange rate which compares the cost of living in each country. These exchange rates are known as purchasing power parities. For instance, if a typical basket of goods costs 10 francs in France and £1 in the UK, then national income should be converted at an exchange rate of 10 francs to the £1 - even if the market exchange rate gives a very different figure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even this is not accurate enough. In some countries, consumers have to purchase goods which in others are free. For instance, Sweden spends a greater proportion of its national income than Italy on fuel for heating because of its colder climate. But this extra expenditure does not give the Swedes a higher standard of living. Again, countries are different geographically and one country might have higher transport costs per unit of output than another because of congestion or having to transport goods long distances.</p>
<p>In practice, it is almost impossible to adjust national income figures for these sorts of differences.</p>
<p>Economists believe that the numbers cannot capture our true overall well-being as a nation in comparison with other countries.</p>
<p>They point out that many qualitative changes could make a country better off than other countries without necessarily achieving higher RGNP per head, such as reduction of crime and violence, greater equality of opportunity, improved racial harmony, and reduction of drug and alcohol abuse. Similarly, rising RGNP per head is usually accompanied by rising external cost, such as pollution, noise and accidents. These are not officially measured within national income but they do affect welfare and distort comparison of well-being between nations.</p>
<p>Thus, we must understand that GNP is not a complete measure of economic welfare; nor is it meant to be. It is a measure of output or income, and should be seen in that context.</p>
<p>To come to a general judgment on living standards within an economy we can use a range of alternative indicators and then make a cross comparison between nations on similar terms.</p>
<p>These could include: ownership of consumer durables such as electronics and other home appliences, estimates of pollution levels and measures of social welfare such as Home ownership levels and following indicators,</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp;the number of patients per doctor - a measure of health provision in&nbsp;a country<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;hospital waiting lists for important operations<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;the number of children per thousand of the population who die each year (infant mortality rates)<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;the average food intake per person (measured by average calorific intake)<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;the proportion of the population that can read or write - literacy rates<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;average educational attainment at different age levels<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;crime rates<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;divorce rates</p>
<p>These statistics should indicate what proportion of the population is enjoying a minimum standard of living in different countries, although perceptions of what is needed for a basic quality of life vary widely.</p>
<p>So economists have developed several alternatives that take other factors into account and give a more complete picture of the level of huma well-being.</p>
<p>One of those is measure of economic welfare (MEW). This starts with GNP and NNP. In addition&nbsp;to this was added an allowance for leisure, for various non-marketed goods and services such as housework and underground activities, for the services of various public amenities such as parks and roads, and for private durable goods such as furniture and jewellery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various items were subtracted. These included regrettables such as expenditure on defence and commuting to work, and various 'bads' such as pollution. Also various intermediate items such as the benefits of education were subtracted.</p>
<p>The big problem with using MEW is in obtaining reliable estimates of all the additional items it includes. As a result it has not been adopted by governmental statistical agencies around the world.</p>
<p>The most well-known measure of quality of life is the Human Development Index (HDI) that has been developed under the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
<p>The Human Development Index (HDI) is the average of three indicators:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Standard of living, as measured by real GNP per capita (PPP$)<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Life expectancy at birth, in years<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Educational attainment, as measured by a weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and enrolment ratio (one-third weight)</p>
<p>The closer the HDI is to I, the closer the country is to achieving the maximum values defined for each of the three indicators.</p>
<p>The advantage of using HDI is that it highlights the fact that people's welfare is influenced not only by the goods and services available to them but also by their ability to lead a long and healthy life and to acquire knowledge, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative factors.</p>
<p>As mentioned above income is an integral part of determining quality of life but not the only factor. We also need to consider the data on some important economic variables which determine the over all outlook of an economy.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 299</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8524</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how the analysis of wage determination in perfect competition leads to an equilibrium.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Wages are the price paid for labour. In a perfectly competitive labour market wage rate is determined by the demand for and supply of labour. This type of market is characterized by many firms competing with one another in hiring a specific type of labour and there are numerous qualified workers with identical skills independently supply labour. There exist perfect knowledge,&nbsp;perfect mobility and freedom of entry and exit. Consequently, both firms and individual workers are wage takers.</p>
<p>The total, or market, demand curve for labour is found by summing horizontally the labor demand curves of the individual firms. On the supply side of the labor market, we assume there is no union; workers compete individually for available jobs. The supply curve for each type of labor slopes upward, indicating that employers as a group must pay higher wage rates to obtain more workers. This is so because firms must bid these workers away from other industries.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b86cec6af5df1dd887b91c4deaacc7ff" alt="" width="284" height="171"></p>
<p>In the figure above the equilibrium wage rate and level of employment are determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves. To the individual firm the market wage rate Wc. Each of the many firms employs such a small fraction of the total available supply of this type of labor that none can influence the wage rate.</p>
<p>Each individual firm will find it profitable to hire this type of labor up to the point at which marginal revenue product (MRPL) is equal to marginal resource cost(MCL). The marginal revenue product, MRP, is the increase in revenue due to employing one more unit of labour. MRPL is determined by the MPPL multiplied by the MR (MRPL = MPPL x MR).</p>
<p>The marginal physical product of labour, MPPL, is the increase in total output when one more worker is employed and is subject to the law of diminishing returns. The MR is determined by the price of the finished product. In a perfectly competitive product market, the MR = AR. Therefore a firm, in the short-run, may experience production, revenue and profit as shown in the following table:</p>

<p>The MRP rises and then declines due to the law of diminishing returns. The wage rate (W) is constant at £200 and this represents the marginal cost (MCL) and the average cost (ACL) of labour. The profit maximising position for the firm is where: MRP = MCL</p>
<p>In the table above this is where 6 workers are employed. The firm would not employ the 7th worker since he or she would only add £90 to revenue but would cost the firm £200 - hence reduces firm's profit by £ 110.</p>

<p>The graph sums up wage determination and equilibrium for a profit maximising firm in a perfectly competitive industry. The wage rate is determined in the market by demand and supply forces and the firm is wage taker.</p>
<p>For this firm the downward sloping portion of the MRPL is the demand for labour .The supply curve of the firm is the average cost of labour(ACL). In a perfectly competitive labour market, the ACL will equal the marginal costs (MCL). The profit maximising firm faces a perfectly elastic supply curve for labour (MCL<sub>i</sub>) which means that additional labour can be hired at the same wage rate Wi. <br><br></p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 300</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8288</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The decision to privatise Kenya Railways and Uganda Railways has met with interest among international rail operators as it is thought that profits could be made and current commercial losses could be avoided.</p>

In a modern sense, privatization means more than this and includes direct sale of government-owned enterprises through offering shares to the public, management and worker buyouts and direct sale to new owners. It also includes deregulation, franchising and contracting out. </p>
<p>The proponents of privatization argue that once privatized, firms become subject to direct market forces in both the capital and the product markets. Within the product market suppliers have to become sensitive to price to gain consumers' preferences; this may entail altering quality, lowering costs, adapting quickly to changes in taste etc. Within the capital market firms become accountable to shareholders. Indeed to a large extent the privatized firms would be far more concerned with profits and repayments than the open purse of the government, which in the final resort will always honour any debts generated due to inefficiencies. </p>
<p>The important objective of privatization is to expose the public sector to market forces on the basis that competition increases efficiency. It is argued that the development of competitive markets in privatized industries will be more efficient in terms of both allocative efficiency (prices charged relate to marginal cost) and productive efficiency (the lowest possible cost of producing any level of output). </p>
<p>On the contrary ,the market forces argument for privatisation largely breaks down if a public monopoly is simply replaced by a private monopoly. A related problem is that of industries with high capital costs. Once established, a monopoly will have an effective barrier to the entry of competitors if it is very capital intensive. Potential entrants may be unable or unwilling to raise sufficient capital to break into the market. The market is not contestable, since the entry and exit costs are too high. Such industries are therefore likely to remain inefficient monopolies, as in the case of the water companies, which each have a monopoly in their own area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here is that the monopoly has less need to rely on efficiency to make profits. It can make large profits for its shareholders simply by raising prices. In such cases the interests of the shareholders will be in conflict with the interests of customers. The problem is that the monopoly producer in a free market could use its power to drive up prices. The long-run profitmaximising position is illustrated in Figure below. </p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/9395a726c67fa79f4d032470bf3ded66" alt="" width="392" height="227"></p>
<p>In Figure above assume initially that the firm just seeks to cover long-run average costs (P = LRAC) and that, therefore, if it is in the private sector it does not exploit its monopoly power to earn supernormal profits. Q<sub>1</sub> will be sold at a price of P<sub>1</sub> and at a cost of LRAC.</p>
<p>Now assume that the industry is shared between two equal-sized producers. The average cost of each supplier would be considerably higher than that of a single supplier. Continuing with the assumption that a price is charged that just covers LRAC, the market price will have to rise to P<sub>2,</sub> with total consumption of Q<sub>2</sub> This is divided equally between the two suppliers, which each supply Q<sub>3</sub> at a cost of LRAC<sub>2</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>It is potentially more efficient therefore to have a single monopoly supplier whenever there is a natural monopoly. It avoids wasteful duplication.<br>Another point of debate between the two sides is the issues of externalities and social justice. The advocates of privatisation argue that externalities are a relatively minor problem, and anyway can be dealt with by appropriate taxes, subsidies and regulations even if the industry is privatised. Likewise, questions of fairness and social justice can be dealt with by subsidies or regulations. A loss-making bus service can be subsidised so that it can be run profitably by a private bus company. </p>
<p>Critics argue that only the most glaring examples of externalities and injustice can be taken into account, given that the whole ethos of a private company is different from a nationalised one: private profit is the goal rather than public service. Externalities, they argue, are extremely widespread and need to be taken into account by the industry itself and not just by an occasionally intervening government. </p>
<p>In conclusion, not in all circumstances privatization results in improvement in efficiency. There are cases when privatization leads to further inefficiencies.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 301</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8277</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what is meant by allocative and productive efficiency.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Economic efficiency exists when any additional changes in the economy would benefit some people only by making others worse off. This means that the greatest possible level of infinite wants is being met with those scarce resources.</p>
<p>Economic efficiency is a two pronged concept, namely allocative and productive efficiency.</p>
<p>Allocative efficiency is when an economy allocates right amount of scarce resources to produce right products. In other words resources are said to be allocatively efficient when it is not possible to produce a combination of goods, different from that currently being produced, which will allow any one person to be made better off without making, at least, one other person worse off.</p>
<p>Allocative efficiency deemed to exist when the price of the product is equal to its marginal cost of production i.e.</p>
<p>P &nbsp;= &nbsp;MC or MB(MU) = MC</p>
<p>Any economic activity, for example, production or consumption, should be expanded as long as marginal benefits exceed marginal costs and should be reduced if marginal costs are greater than marginal benefits. The optimal amount of the activity occurs where MB = MC.</p>
<p>Consider an example of compact discs (CD). As we know the opportunity costs of additional units of CD will rise as more units are produced. This can be shown with an upward sloping MC curve. We are also aware that we obtain diminishing marginal benefits (MB) from additional units of CD. Therefore, the second unit of a CD yields less additional utility (MU) or benefit (MB) than the first. And a third will provide even less MB than the second. Therefore, we can portray the marginal benefits from CD with a downward sloping MB curve, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/cc964e921d71c364530fc6c87766cf19" alt="" width="303" height="213"></p>
<p>The optimal quantity of CD production is indicated by the intersection of the MB and MC curves: 200,000 units in the figure above. To prove this, if only 100,000 CDs were produced, the marginal benefit of CD would exceed its marginal cost (MB &gt; MC). In money terms, MB might be $15, while MC is only $5. This suggests that society would be under-allocating resources to CD production; more of it should be produced.</p>
<p>Since society values an additional CD as being worth $15, while the alternative products which the required resources could produce are worth only $5. Society benefits-it is better off in the sense that it can enjoy, something worth $15 by forgoing something worth only $5. Net gains can be realized until CD production increased to 200,000. A reallocation of resources from other products to CD would mean society is using its resources more efficiently. Each additional CD up to 200,000 would improve allocative efficiency. But when MB = MC, the benefit of producing CD or alternative products with the available resources are equal, i.e. allocative efficiency is achieved.</p>
<p>The production of 300,000 CD would represent an over-allocation of resources. Here the MC of CD is $15 and MB is $5 (MB &lt; MC). At this level a CD is worth only $5 for society whereas the alternative product to which the resources could produce are valued at $15.Therefore, society gains something worth $15 by forgoing something worth $5. Net gains can be realized until CD production can be reduced to 200,000.</p>
<p>Hence resources are being efficiently allocated to any product when its output is such that its marginal benefit equals its marginal cost (MB = MC).</p>
<p>Productive efficiency exists when products must be produced using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible cost of production.</p>
<p>Following are the two conditions to achieve productive efficiency.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Production must take place on the lowest possible AC<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp;Production needs to occur at the lowest point on that lowest AC curve i.e. point x on the diagram below, also known as technically efficient point.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/36f562370f89c71cc8c9be9eb7f48ac7" alt="" width="260" height="196"></p>
<p>In a perfectly competitive market, in the long run, competition forces firms to produce at the minimum average total cost of production and to charge a price which is just consistent with that cost. It means that firms must use the best available production methods and combinations of inputs or they will not survive. Similarly in a perfectly competitive market profit motivated firms produce each good or service to the point where price and MC are equal. Each item is produced to the point at which the value of the last unit is equal to the value of the alternative products sacrificed. Thus society's resources are being allocated efficiently. In an imperfect market the firm's AC is higher than optimal from society's point of view, thus productive efficiency is not achieved. Also profit maximizing price exceeds MC which means imperfect markets under-allocate resources.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 302</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8273</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Employment in Turkey<br> </strong></p>
<p>A large proportion of the work that women do in Turkey consists of traditional activities and is unpaid. Of those Turkish women who are in employment, 72% work in agriculture (compared with a world average of 49%). In total, Turkey's agricultural sector still employs 48% of the workforce (compared with 17% in the US and 3.9% in France).</p>
<p>In Turkey, the greatest social inequality between the sexes lies in the level of education. 26% of the women are illiterate, compared with 7.5% of the men. There is mass migration to cities, which offer more jobs and services, but the less educated women are not able to take up these opportunities.</p>
<p>There are more non-industrial jobs than industrial jobs in the cities and as many as 66% of all lower-class urban families depend on non-industrial, unskilled work for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Turkey continues to face economic challenges including a large informal economy, large income inequalities, a large inefficient government sector, and relatively high unemployment. Birth rates and death rates are declining. The age structure, in which there are many young people, will continue to cause difficulties in the labour market as young people become old enough to seek jobs. Since 1970 the population of Europe has multiplied by 1.2 but in Turkey it has multiplied by 2.5. Many Turkish people seek work in other countries where they think the job opportunities are better.</p>

<li>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in one year time period. The term 'gross' indicates that depreciation of capital is still to be accounted for and the term 'domestic output' includes goods and services produced by citizen-supplied and foreign-supplied resources within a particular nation's geographical boundaries.</li>
<li>The reasons for low GDP might be the large percentage of the female population engaged in traditional unpaid work which does not come in GDP and a high rate of unemployment ( 9 % in the year 2003.)</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>the level of wages</li>
<li>non-wage factors (training, working environment etc.)</li>
<li>occupational mobility, geographical mobility, birth rate and migration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The workers in rural areas are usually engaged in low productivity agro-based occupations. In urban areas their labour could be transferred into higher productivity manufacturing and service sector jobs. Output, if it were recorded, would be lower in rural areas as labour migrates and this would have a negative effect on GDP. Those who are fortunate to remain in employment after migration will have larger incomes. Their spending will rise, with the resulting positive effects on growth and GDP. However, the workers may be inefficient so the increase in incomes may not be large. Also, there may be a negative effect on GDP if migrants fail to find jobs in cities, and from being low productivity rural workers, they become zero productivity urban unemployed. The overall effect on GDP is uncertain as information given is insufficient.</li>
<li>The term 'developing countries' is used for economies which are still developing, in contrast with the 'developed economies' which have reached an advanced stage of economic development. Developing countries are usually characterised by low per capita income, shortage of physical and human capital, high population growth rate, poor health facilities coupled with high mortality rate, high unemployment or underemployment and dominating subsistence sector. <br><br>A large part of given information suggests that Turkey is a developing country. For instance, a greater amount of activities of female workers consists of traditional unpaid work indicates that Turkey is still a tradition-bound society. Also, 72 % of Turkish female workers employed in agricultural sector is well above the world average of 49%, a clear evidence of the existence of large subsistence sector. Gender discrimination is reflected by inequalities in educational attainment, i.e. 26% of the female population are illiterate as compared with 7.5% of the male population. Twenty percent of the total population is living below poverty line, and those of 18% on the poverty line, sugests that Turkey is suffering from widespread poverty - a distinct feature of developing countries. In addition to this Turkey is facing a rapid rate of growth of population and a high rate of unemployment which stands at 9% in the year 2003. The country is still not industrialized enough to create high productivity industrial jobs. <br><br>However, the information in the extract alone is insufficient to form an overall judgment. More information about Turkish economy is required, for example, we need to know the level of GDP and changes in the GDP over time, the distribution of income, levels of per head income and most importantly information on health provision. There is also some conflicting information given, for example, the percentage of GDP from employment in manufacturing and services does not match with the percentage expected in a developing country but there is no comparison given with other countries. <br><br>In conclusion, some of the information given indicates that Turkey is a developing country, however, we need to have more information on the Turkish economy and most importantly information on the structure and outlook of developed economies in order to make a comparative analysis and to form a final judgment.</li>

Discuss its ability to improve its performance on the current account.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The current account is one of the three components of the balance of payments of an economy. The current account records payments for imports and exports of goods and services, plus incomes flowing into and out of the country, plus net transfers of money into and out of the country. The current account usually has four categories: trade in goods account, trade in services account, income flows and current transfers of money.</p>
<p>The trade in goods account, also known as visible account, records imports and exports of physical goods. Exports result in inflow of money and imports result in outflow of money. The balance is called the balance on trade in goods. Pakistan, since many years, has been facing a deficit in goods account. The total exports for the fiscal year 2007-2008 were $15255.5 billion and the total imports were $32.06 billion. Pakistan's major exports are food items, textile, sports goods, surgical goods and leather goods. Pakistan's major imports are machinery, petroleum products, chemicals, transport equipments, edible oil, iron and steel, fertilizer and tea.</p>
<p>The trade in services account records imports and exports of services such as transport, tourism and insurance. The balance of these is called the service balance. Pakistan like other developing countries faces deficit on trade in services.</p>
<p>Investment incomes consist of interest, profit and dividend flowing into and out of the country and transfers of money include government grants into and out of the country. Transfers also include international transfers of money by private individuals and firms. Pakistan does have surplus on income flows and transfers mainly due to huge net remittances by Pakistanis living abroad and also due to economic assistance received by the government from international organizations and various donor countries.</p>
<p>The current account balance is the overall balance of all the above three subdivisions. Pakistan faces current account deficit of approximately $8 billion in the year 2007-2008.</p>
<p>The current account deficit hovering Pakistan's economy leads to serious implications for all stakeholders in the economy. Firstly, the exchange rate is adversely affected. Secondly, due to the depreciated rupee, Pakistan has been importing inflation, mainly because Pakistan imports machinery, raw materials and most significant, petrol and petroleum products. Thirdly, the government, having faced a deficit on the current account, has got to abate the development part of its current expenditure, thus leading to a reduction in the public welfare services and projects. Lastly, in order to curtail the depreciation of the local rupee that follows the current account deficit, the State Bank of Pakistan has to utilize its foreign reserves to stabilize the currency, and presently the State Bank of Pakistan has been using up its foreign reserves, which have fell quite considerably now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government of Pakistan has been, since many years, trying to improve Pakistan's export capability and decrease the economy's dependence on other economies. Some attempts have been successful and some abortive. Pakistan, to go for a better current account, has got to substitute its imports by its own locally manufactured goods. But the expensive and inadequate energy at home leads to high energy bills and halts in production, which reduces the capability and competitiveness of local industries, and it is these industries which have to compete with products from countries like Brazil, India and China, who produce more updated goods and sell them at cheaper prices.</p>
<p>Importing petrol and petroleum products are what mainly increases the import bill of Pakistan and since petrol has to be imported and is not found in Pakistan, thus a major part of the import bill can not be reduced unless alternate energy is found I developed. Pakistan's government should plan to develop coal reserves, available in huge quantity, to use as an alternate source of fuel in power generation. It will not only reduce import bill but also provide cheaper energy to improve competitiveness of local industries.</p>
<p>Pakistan's marginal propensity to import is also very high and to reduce the demand for imports requires extensive promotional campaigns to increase the demand for local products. Lastly, the government could keep on varying the level and amount of import barriers and tariffs to decrease imports.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Pakistan's export performance has not been satisfactory. There is less human capital available and not much is being developed. Also, it is difficult to divert resources towards industrialization from the primary sector. Lastly, the financial and capital markets in Pakistan are hardly developed and there is a lack of entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>In conclusion, If Pakistan has to improve its current account position, then firstly low cost energy needs to be developed, secondly availability of skilled labour is essential.</p>
<p>Lastly, there should be least interference by the government so that decisions are not taken in the vested interests of some specific groups. <br>Pakistan is rich in availability of natural resources, but, unfortunately, due to lack of political stability and effective economic planning, the nation has not been able to realize its economic potential and will continue to suffer until there is a political will among the leaders and strong desire among masses to improve their economic lives.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 304</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8269</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the difference between expenditure-switching and expenditure-dampening policies as a means of correcting a balance of payments disequilibrium.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Balance of payment is a record of all the transactions that have occurred between the residents of a country and the rest of the world over a one-year period. The accounts are divided into two main sections, namely the current account and the capital and financial account. <br>Although the balance of payments always balance this does not mean that there is necessarily a balance of payments equilibrium. Balance of payments is in a state of disequilibrium when there is deficit or surplus. If there is a deficit which is only short term then it can be financed either by running down official reserves or by official borrowing. There may, however, be what is called a fundamental disequilibrium in the balance of payments, with a persistent deficit. If this is the case then other measures have to be pursued. These measures are broadly classified as expenditure-switching and expenditure-dampening policies. <br>Expenditure-switching policies include any policies designed to persuade domestic purchasers to purchase home-produced goods and services rather than imports. It would also include any policies designed to persuade foreign purchasers to buy more exports from your economy. These policies are not designed to reduce total amount of spending in a country but to re-direct or 'switch' spending to your country's products rather than those produced in another country. The impact should be a fall in import expenditure and a rise in export earnings. Expenditure-switching policies include the following measures: tariffs, quotas,&nbsp;exchange controls, and export subsidies.</p>
<p>Along with embargoes and voluntary export restraints, all have the disadvantage that they interfere with market forces and prevent the consumer from benefiting from the effects of specialisation and trade. In addition a government's ability to resort to expenditure-switching policies is limited by membership of the WTO. As a result they may be forced to resort to expenditure-dampening policies.</p>
<p>An expenditure-dampening policy is any action taken by a government that is designed to reduce the total level of spending in an economy. This will have two principal effects. First, a reduction in spending will mean that there will be fewer purchases of imported goods and services. Secondly, domestic producers will find that their domestic market is 'dampened' and is more difficult to sell in. As a result they may try to make up for the decrease in sales domestically with increases in sales abroad. The overall impact therefore should be a fall in imports and a rise in exports. Expenditure dampening policies include deflationary fiscal policies and deflationary monetary policies.</p>
<p>Deflationary fiscal policies mean raising taxes and reducing government expenditure. Raising taxes will reduce disposable incomes meaning that less will be available to spend on imports. In addition the reduced government spending will lead to a downward multiplier effect which will depress incomes further.</p>
<p>Deflationary monetary policies include raising interest rates and reducing the money supply. In addition to attracting inflows of foreign capital that&nbsp;will increase the demand for the currency on the foreign exchange market; increases in the rate of interest will reduce the money supply and deflate the economy. This is because the higher interest rate will reduce the demand for loans for consumption and investment and lead to a fall in aggregate monetary demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference between the two is reflected in terms of their overall effects. For example, switching measures encourage buyers to purchase more of domestic products whereas dampening measures reduce the overall expenditure on both foreign and local goods and services.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 305</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8268</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss how a rapid rate of inflation might affect different groups within an economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Rapid rate of inflation is considered an evil phenomenon by conomists all over the world because it brings with it economic imbalance and a number of distortions.</p>
<p>We must first be clear about the difference between money (or nominal) income and real income. Nominal income is the number of Rs. received as wages, rent, interest, or profits. Real income measures the amount of goods and services nominal income can buy.</p>
<p>If an individual's nominal income increases faster than the price level, his real income will rise. If the price level increases faster than his nominal income, his real income will decline. We can determine approximately how real income changes with this formula:<br><br>% changes in real income = % change in nominal income - % change in price level</p>
<p>A person's real income drops only when his nominal income fails to keep pace with inflation.</p>
<p>The redistribution effects of inflation depend on whether or not it is expected. With fully expected or anticipated inflation, an income receiver may be able to avoid or lessen the adverse effects inflation would otherwise have on real income. But an unanticipated rapid inflation may bring following serious income distortions.</p>
<p>Inflation redistributes real income away from fixed-income receivers towards others in the economy. The classic case is the elderly couple living on pension or annuity providing a fixed amount of nominal income each month. They may have retired in, say, 1998 on what appeared to be an adequate pension. However, by 2008 they will discover that the purchasing power of that pension has been cut by one-half.</p>
<p><br>Similarly, landlords who receive lease payments of fixed amounts will be hurt by inflation as they receive Rs. of declining value over time. To a lesser extent some whitecollar workers, for example,some public sector employees whose incomes are dictated by fixed pay scales, and families living on fixed levels of welfare will also be victims of inflation.</p>
<p>Some people living on flexible incomes may benefit. For example, workers in expanding industries who are represented by strong unions may keep their nominal wages apace with rate of inflation. Whereas those in declining industries or without strong unions may find that the price level jumps ahead of their money incomes. Business executives and other profit receivers may benefit if product prices rise faster than resource prices as business receipts will grow at a faster rate than inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation hurts savers. As prices rise, the real value, or the purchasing power of a nest egg of savings deteriorates. The simplest case is the individual who hoards money as a cash balance. A Rs. 100,000 cash balance would have lost half its real value between 1995 and 2005. Of course, most forms of savings earn interest. But the value of savings will still decline if the rate of inflation exceeds the rate of interest.</p>
<p>Unanticipated rapid inflation benefits debtors (borrowers) at the expense of creditors (lenders). Suppose you borrow Rs. 10,000 from a bank, to be repaid in 2 years. If in that time the general level of prices doubles, the Rs. 10,000 which you repay will have only half the purchasing power of the amount originally borrowed. The inflation of the past several decades has been a windfall to those who purchased homes in earlier periods with low,&nbsp; fixed-interest-rate mortgages. Inflation has greatly reduced the real burden of their mortgage indebtedness. They have also benefited because the nominal value of housing has increased more rapidly then the overall price level.</p>
<p>Nominal national income and therefore tax collections rise with inflation; the amount of public debt owed does not. Thus, inflation reduces the real burden of the public debt to the government. In fact, some nations such as Brazil once used inflation so extensively to reduce the real value of their debt. <br>Finally exporters may lose as their money incomes may fall due to less exports but importers may find their money incomes rising faster than inflation due to rising level of imports.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 306</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8265</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how the rate of inflation is measured.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Inflation is defined as a persistent and generalized increase in the level of prices. The term persistent implies that average of all prices is rising year in and year out.&nbsp;Inflation is measured by changes in the retail price index (RPI) which records changes in the general level of prices paid by consumers for all the goods and services they buy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An index number is a means whereby changes in a large number of related variables can be averaged, and the average change expressed through movements in a single number. Its calculation is a major statistical task, involving three main stages illustrated below.</p>
<p>Firstly, a survey is conducted to find out what families buy and how much they spend on particular items. The findings from the survey help economists to select items and to assign relative weights to individual commodities according to the percentage of income spent on each commodity by an average household. To construct an example let's assume that the selected items are fuel, milk and meat and households spend their income in the ratio 2:3:4 respectively on these commodities.</p>
<p>Then comes the second stage of recording how much the prices of selected items have changed, the information is collected from all main retail outlet and from utility providers such as gas, water and transport etc. For example, if the prices of selected items in our example change as that of milk per litre from Rs. 30 toRs. 28, of fuel from Rs. 55 to Rs. 70 and that of 1 Kg. meat from Rs. 100 to Rs. 110. <br>Once the prices have been recorded, at the third and last stage the percentage change in price for each item is then multiplied by its weights. From this the average change in the RPI is determined, as illustrated below:</p>

<p>The price index for each category shows what has happened to the price level since a base year value. To generate a weighted price index we multiply the price index for each category by its weight and then sum these. We then divide this by the sum of the weights (9) to find an overall price index (108.3).</p>
<p>If the index is calculated to be over 100 in year 1, then on average price level has increased compared with the base year (year 0) index =100. In our example index in year 1 is 108.3, then price level has risen by 8.3% since the base year. An index of below 100 in year 1 would indicate a fall in average price level.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 307</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8264</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the desirability of the worldwide movement towards the market economy and away from the planned economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An economic system comprises of all the institutional means through which scarce national resources are allocated to satisfy infinite human wants. Free market economy and planned economy are two such systems.</p>
<p>A free market is typically characterized by limited involvement of government in the economy coupled with individual ownership of the means of production. Individuals can pursue their own self-interest without many constraints. Free market is thus one where decisions are decenteralised and resource allocation takes place through price system, also known as invisible hand.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in a command economy government controls the factors of production and makes all key decisions about their use and about the distribution of income. Thus decision making is a centralized process. The complete opposite of the pure self-interest of the free market system, consumers, workers and the government are all assumed to be working for the 'common good'. There is no competition, so there is no price mechanism. The authorities set the prices. As the government runs the system, they have the job of planning how all the available resources should be used.</p>
<p>It makes sense that free market economies allocate resources more efficiently. Decisions about what to produce are made by the people who will actually consume the goods. Firms will produce whatever consumers are prepared to buy since, due to the free enterprise, there are no restrictions on what the firms can produce. It is of no surprise, that there will be a much larger choice of goods and services in a free market economy compared with a command economy. Firms will always be looking to produce something new to get ahead of their competitors. Even though the government's role is limited, one of its jobs is to protect property rights. Hence, there are incentives in the free market system for firms to be innovative and produce better quality products.</p>
<p>Contrary to this, in a planned economy planners are less likely to make the correct decisions across the whole economy. The planner will be more concerned with making sure that there are enough essential goods to go around rather than allocating resources efficiently between all goods. Also there is no incentive for the planner to be innovative, as long as they produce the essentials the planners will be happy. <br>With all the advantages explained above free market system does have certain drawbacks.</p>
<p>There may be a problem with merit goods and demerit goods. Merit goods, like health and education, tend to be under provided in a free market. Demerit goods are bad for the people and they may be over consumed. A government with a limited role might not take enough action in this area. For many, income disparity alone is the biggest disadvantage of a free market economy. A few may grow as millionaires while unemployment and poverty also rises. A command economy might not have the efficiency and enterprise for the successful to make millions, but at least the strong government will try to make sure that nobody falls through the safety net. It will be a fairer economy, even though it is likely to be less successful overall.</p>
<p>Historically, free market system has proved to be more successful in terms of achieving economic efficiency, higher rates of economic growth and most importantly better living standards. The most successful economy in the world (in terms of size) has been the USA, and they have been one of the freest economies in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phenomenal economic success in the capitalist block led to the Berlin Wall falling down late in 1989, and along with it the concept of planned economies throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This stark reality led to the growing desirability among masses to opt for free market system, where they could enjoy consumer sovereignty, wider choice and lower prices. The driving force for this change was people power.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 308</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8262</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the contributions of enterprise and division of labour to an economy.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Enterprise is a distinct type of human resource. Entrepreneurship is associated with the founding of new businesses, or taking the initiative in combining the resources of land, capital, and labor to produce a good or service. The entrepreneur is the driving force behind production and the agent who combines the other resources in what is hoped will be a successful business venture. As an innovator he is the one who attempts to introduce, on a commercial basis, new products, new productive techniques, or even new forms of business organization. The entrepreneur risks not only time, effort, and business reputation but his or her invested funds and those of associates. <br>The role of entrepreneur is of prime importance in a free market economy. It is the entrepreneur who decides what to produce, how to produce and where to produce. Without the entrepreneur, land, labour and capital are just masses of resources of no economic importance. It is the entrepreneur who organizes them for production and devices technical combinations of inputs to make the most efficient use of scarce resources. <br>Large production units allow the process of production to be broken down into a series of tasks. This is called division of labour. Adam Smith, in his book, showed how the production of pins would benefit from the application of the division of labour in a factory. He suggested that pin making could be divided into 18 distinct operations and that each employee undertook only one of the operations, production would rise to 5000 pins per employee per day. This was compared to his estimate that each employee would be able to produce only a few dozen each day if they produce pins individually. <br>Division of labour allows people to specialize in doing a job at which they can become both proficient and efficient. This improvement in efficiency results in higher productivity, mass output, reduction in per unit cost and prosperity in general.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 309</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8261</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a world-famous radio and television broadcaster.

<p>One economist has.argued that the BBC should receive more finance, that BBC broadcasting is a public good, and that it has greater value for viewers than they have to pay for. To support his view he produced two diagrams. Fig.1 shows the demand for BBC services among the 23 million television-owning households in the UK and Fig. 2 shows where this economist placed BBC broadcasting among a selection of public goods in 2005.</p>

<li>The curve AB on the following PPC graph shows the trade off between the two types of programmes before increase in licence fees.<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/522ff5c8d8dd062e72e9c2c77c1511ed" alt="" width="221" height="217"><br>More finances available to the programme makers due to increased licence fees would result in potential increase in resources at their disposal, hence enhances their capacity to produce both types of programmes more in number as shown by the shift in PPC from AB to CD.</li>
<li>TV licence and TV sets are complementary goods, therefore the two goods will have negative cross elasticity of demand. A rise in licence cost would result in some degree of demand reduction and a fall in price for TV sets as shown in the graph below:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c701228e2305b929d414c046334bc48b" alt="" width="239" height="196"><br>The demand curve for TV sets shifts leftwards from D to D<sub>1</sub>, resulting in a fall in their price and quantity traded.

<li>In almost all markets, consumers collectively obtain more utility (satisfaction) from their purchases than the amount of their expenditures ( product price X quantity). This surplus of utility arises because some consumers are willing to pay more than the equilibrium price but need not do so. According to fig.1&nbsp;a fraction less than 17 million, out of a total of 23 million consumers, are willing to pay more than £ 121 but end up paying £ 121 therefore, receive better value for their money. Only a fraction less than 6 million are willing to pay less than the prevailing license fee. Overall, more people are paying less than what they are willing to pay, therefore, obtain net benefit usually termed as consumer surplus.</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Non-excludability is when there is no effective way of excluding individuals from their benefits once those goods come into existence. Non-rivalry means when more people consume the product, the benefit to those already consuming the product is not diminished. National defense had both a greater degree of non-rivalry and non-excludability than police services. On the scale of non-excludability both national defense and police services are regarded as non excludable to a large extent. However, national defense is fraction higher than police services on this scale. On the scale of non-rivalry people perceive national defense as a better example than police services because consumption of police services by one member of the public would reduce availability to others. National defense qualifies, to a great extent, as better example of public good than police services.</li>
<li>Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous in their characteristics. That is, they can be jointly consumed by many individuals simultaneously without any discriminatory price system being applied. Public goods, therefore, involve free rider problem that is, we all want to be free riders when we believe that someone else will pay and then these goods would be available to all. <br>Therefore, cannot be supplied through markets. <br>Education and health are usually considered to be merit goods or private goods rather than public goods. The principles of exclusion or rivalry can be applied on both education and health care. This simply implies that anyone who does not pay for them can be excluded from enjoying their benefits. For example, if a student is unable to pay the cost of a bachelor degree will be excluded from the degree program. Principle of rivalry means that if a surgeon is operating a patient other patients cannot benefit from his services at the same time. The patients are rivals for this resource, the amount of sergeon's time is scarce. Surgeon's services are therefore priced according to our levels of demand and supply of his time. There is nothing inherent in any of these particular goods that makes them different from private goods. They can be supplied through the market and in some countries they actually are. <br>What constitutes a merit good is defined by the political process according to what the government deems to be socially desirable. With the idea of a failure of information, a merit good is defined as a good that is better for a person than the person who may consume the good realizes. Under this definition education and healthcare are often characterised as merit goods rather than public goods.</li>

Their aim is to maximize profits or minimize losses. Take the case of a firm in perfect competition:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/6e32806ff648b1860b98152c0c73bd7a" alt="" width="306" height="158"></p>
<p>As shown, the equilibrium level of output where MC= MR; the firm is making supernormal profits (shaded area) because the price OP<sub>e</sub> is higher than the unit cost C.</p>
<p>What should the firms do when the price falls? Refer to the diagram:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8223a0f1eb990eaf3916ab0da41ada30" alt="" width="349" height="164"></p>
<p>In the short run, the firms have two types of cost; fixed and variable. If the price falls from P<sub>e</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>, it is still making supernormal profits, and therefore should not be closing down. If the price falls to P<sub>2</sub>, then the firm is making only normal profits. In the long run, this is the lowest level of profit to keep the firm's resources in their present use. However, in all of these situations; the firm may want to consider closing down in the long run. Yes even with supernormal profits. The profits are higher in another industry, then the firm would move to that industry. This is the concept of economic profits.</p>
<p>Referring to the diagram again, what if the price falls further to OP<sub>3</sub>? It is making subnormal profits or a loss; but it should not close down because part of the fixed cost (FC) can be recovered. However if the price falls further to OP<sub>4</sub>, that is the shut-down point, losses cannot be reduced or increased regardless of any decision. But the firm should close in the long run. Finally if the price falls to OP<sub>5</sub> in the short-run; it should close down immediately otherwise losses will be increasing. The fixed costs are not being lowered; nor the accumulating variable cost.</p>
<p>Most firms would agree that in the LR, it is logical to close if TC exceeds TR. However, it may still be rational behavior not to do so. Firstly, if firms believe that the current bad times are exceptional, then the share holders would be willing to pay the fixed cost after each expiry. Perhaps the firm will not operate, but not close down as well. Production will commence when good times return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, a large firm may own a few subsidiary firms. If one is making losses, it will affect the share prices of even the other firms. Therefore profits of the other firms will be used to pay for the losses of that one firm. <br><br>In conclusion, it is not true that a firm will close even if it is making losses; and will stay on even with profits.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 311</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8247</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain whether there is a link between the marginal revenue product of labour and the wage rate in an occupation.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The marginal revenue product (MRP) theory states that in equilibrium, factors of production, in this case labour, will receive a price equal to the value of output that is added by the hiring of an additional unit of the factor. The theory, however will only hold true if certain conditions prevail. These include assuming perfect competition in the labour market, homogenous workers and that labour is the only variable factor of production applied to other fixed factors. To illustrate the theory, we examine the equilibrium or the profit-maximising position of the firm. The addition to total revenue of a firm arising from the employment of an additional unit of labour is known as the marginal revenue product. The shape of the MRP curve is influenced by the law of Diminishing Returns and is shown as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/ab7fd50f6b617ebbfde7fe8f0980a670" alt="" width="326" height="142"></p>
<p>The marginal factor cost (MFC) on the other hand, is the addition to total cost arising from using the additional unit of labour output. When there is perfect competition in the labour market, the price of labour is fixed with no single firm being able to influence it. Thus, the MFC curve is a perfectly elastic curve and is equal to the AFC or the wage rate:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/61bdfb868f33a436b4f87f814678c49f" alt="" width="345" height="141"></p>
<p>In order to maximise profits, the firm will compare revenue and cost of utilising an extra unit of labour. If the revenue earned from this is greater than the cost of hiring it, that is, MRP &gt; MFC, then the firm will use more of the factor. This will continue until MRP = MFC when the firm finds that there is no incentive to increase usage of the factor, vice versa. Hence, equilibrium of the firm is given by point B where ON of labour is employed.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/744425fe8fd810e824a7f9e14d279c5c" alt="" width="320" height="134"></p>
<p>Hence, it can be seen that labour will receive a wage rate equal to its marginal product, which is the gist of the MRP theory. The theory thus enables us to indicate the quantity of labour demanded at any given wage rate. From the diagram given below, the firm will then employ OQ<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>of labour, when the wage &nbsp;rate is given as W<sub>1</sub>, OQ<sub>2</sub> at W<sub>2</sub>, OQ<sub>3</sub> at W<sub>3</sub> and so on. In this we can see that the demand curve of labour is thus the falling portion of the MRP curve:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/b99f37b63d177aa5a983272912ce77d5" alt="" width="315" height="159"></p>
<p>From the description of the MRP theory above, we can see that the theory is not really a theory of wage determination. It gives us an idea of how many men will be hired at prevailing wages (demand conditions) but tells us very little about how the particular wage rate came about. Its main limitation is therefore the fact that it ignores the supply conditions in the labour market. The marginal productivity is a necessity but not a sufficient factor to influence wages. Both the demand and supply market forces interact to determine wages in a particular occupational industry. This is illustrated as follows:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/7e239a1d5bb98c00b42d8f52d45c49b3" alt="" width="273" height="197"></p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c5ccaa03bcaad0557e04a5bab412178e" alt="" width="276" height="198"></p>
<p>The figure illustrates a situation where two types of labour have identical MRP but supply conditions vary. In market B, supply is relatively wage inelastic. This could be due to several conditions, for example the existence of a professional body limiting entrants to the occupation. The result is that wage rate is higher in labour market B than labour market A.</p>
<p>Even if supply conditions are not ignored, the marginal product concept by itself presents certain difficulties which make it even more impractical in explaining wages. First, the theory is based on several limiting assumption. In the real world, labour is not perfectly mobile, neither is labour homogenous - there is no single labour market, but many. Such factors lead to imperfectly competitive conditions rather than perfectly competitive conditions for labour which invalidate the theory. Secondly, the theory assumes that the MRP of labour can be measured. In practice, it is difficult in many occupations to quantify the value added by an individual particularly in service occupations like education and health care. Also for factors which for technical reasons have to be combined in fixed proportions, the MRP of each factor cannot be known individually. Thirdly, the theory also assumes that factor price and factor productivity are independent. This is not necessarily valid. Increased wages may call forth extra effort from the labour force so that productivity increases. Such changes in productivity increase the MRP curve to the right. In other words, the demand curve for labour is no longer simply the MRP curve as the theory suggest. Hence, wage determination would be a more complicated affair than simply equating the MRP curve to the supply curve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in our modern economy, wages are by no means determined simply only by demand and supply conditions. The MRP theory has therefore sometimes been criticised for unrealistically ignoring the role of collective bargaining and other methods of pay determination. In particular, the theory ignores the importance of trade unions in wage determination. The union represents its members' interest collectively by bargaining with employers to improve pay and other conditions of work. With such, workers may not be paid according to the value they produce but are paid according to the wage negotiations between workers and employees. In other circumstances, wages may be determined by the state of the government through legislation. This usually occurs in low-paid industries where trade unions are difficult to organise and they tend to be ineffective. The state intervenes to protect the workers by stating minimum rates of pay. In some countries, a minimum wage has been established by law, to cover all industries.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 312</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8243</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'If investment increases it will cause an increase in output.

<p>In this example the capital output ratio is $2 to $1; that is, $2 of machine to $1 of shoe. It can be seen that when sales rise at an increasing rate (from year 1 to year 5), the level of investments rise. When the increase in sales slows down; the level of investments falls. As stated, changes in sales indicate changes in income. The accelerator theory can be summarised as&nbsp;I<sub>t</sub> = v(V<sub>t-1</sub> - Y<sub>t-2</sub>)</p>
<p>where t is the year, v is the capital-output ratio and I is investments. The basic principle underlying the accelerator is that firms maintain a target relation between machines and output. Output cannot be increased unless more machines are bought. <br>The above elucidation is only a possibility. It does not necessarily always happen because many other factors in the real world also determine the investment level.</p>
<p>A change in investment may cause a multiple change in income. In economic theory, this is called the multiplier principle.</p>
<p>The multiplier principle (k) says that when there is an autonomous increase in AD, it will lead to a more than a proportional increase in output (income). This increase in AD is called injection. It can be investments, government expenditure and exports.</p>
<p>To elaborate, we shall, assume a 4-sector economy. There are unemployed resources. The marginal propensity to save (mps) is 0.3, the marginal propensity to import (mpm) is 0.1 and the marginal propensity to tax (mpt) is 0.1. The country receives an investment worth $200m. At present, the economy is at national income equilibrium.</p>
<p>When investments increase by $200 m, the multiple increases in AD and output will be as follows:</p>

<p>This process is based on the basic premise that demand creates supply. The investment is demand, which creates supply, but which becomes demand again. However, demand weakens after each round because of the leakages (savings, import and taxation). The multiplier process can be expressed as</p>
<p>ΔY = ΔI&nbsp;× k<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 200m&nbsp;× 1 / (0.3+0.1+0.1) where<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = $400m<br>k = 1 / (mps + mpt + mpm)</p>
<p>However the above principles - accelerator and multiplier are highly theoretical. They do not always hold true in the real world. A change in income may not have any effect, on investment because there are too many other factors that influence investment simultaneously. In any case, there is a time lag between the two. This makes it difficult to affirm the accelerator relationship. In the case of the multiplier, the value of the multiplier may be too weak. This can be caused by very strong leakages; high values for mps, mpt and mpm. Secondly, the country may have a lot of supply-side problems or may be at full employment. Therefore an increase in investments will not see a more than proportionate increase in national income.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 313</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8238</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how changes in interest rates might influence investment.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Interest is the cost of using money.

However, since cash today can be invested and so earn interest, it is worth more than cash in the future. Because of this, the future stream of net returns expected from the asset must be discounted from a present value (PV) equivalent, which can then be compared with the current cost of the asset. The most obvious discount rate to use for this purpose is the current rate of interest, since this represents the return foregone if cash is used to purchase fixed assets instead of being loaned. If the present value of this future stream of net returns is greater than the current cost of the asset (its supply price), then additional investment will be profitable. Put another way, net present value (NPV) = PV - supply price; if NPV is positive, then additional investment will be profitable.</p>
<p>PV = $5000 / 1 =&nbsp;$5000 / (1.1)<sup>2</sup> =&nbsp;$5000 / (1.1)<sup>3</sup> =&nbsp;$5000 / (1.1)<sup>4</sup> =&nbsp;$5000 /(1.1)<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>= $13294</p>
<p>Thus, purchasing the machine is expected to yield a profit of approximately $13 294 at current prices. Subtracting the current cost of the machine, i.e. <br>$10 000, still yields a positive net return of $3294. In other words, the Net Present Value (NPV) = PV - supply price + $3294. Since NPV is positive, additional investment will be profitable.<sup> <br></sup></p>
<p>Based on the above example, if the interest rate now rises to 20%, then the PV will fall. This may make the investment unprofitable because PV is less than the cost of the capital machinery bought. However, if the interest rate falls to 5%, then PV will rise; making the purchase of more capital equipment profitable. Note that the above discussion is on the basic assumption of all other factors remaining constant. In reality, many other factors also affect investments - political stability, government fiscal policy, cost of capital, new inventions and so forth. If these change as interest rates change, then the above relationship may not hold.&nbsp;<sup><br></sup></p>

<li>In economic theory, investment means spending to create capital. Capital is a man-made factor of production. It refers to buildings, machinery and tools. It is an injection which will trigger off the multiplier effect creating higher income, more jobs and a higher standard of living. <br>In general, investment is always good. Whichever area investment are made in, that area will get higher income and employment through the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect is based on the 2 arguments that demand creates supply and one man's spending becomes another man's income. This can be used to explain how investment would increase the equilibrium level of national income of a country.&nbsp;<br>It is assumed that there are unemployed resources in the 4 sector economy and that there are 3 leakages - savings, taxes and imports. Equilibrium (AE = AS) is present. We shall assume there is an investment of $100 m thus increasing injections into the economy. MPS and MPT are both assumed to be 0.2 and MPM is 0.1. These are the propensities to save, tax and import. Out of every additional $100 of income, the total leakages will be $50. <br>

The initial injection of $100 m becomes income of those who are directly involved in its production. The spending does not stop here as this extra income will stimulate rounds of withdrawal and spending until the increase in the withdrawals in just equal to the amount that was first injected. The process is summarized by <br>ΔJ&nbsp;× K =&nbsp;△Y &nbsp;where K = 1 / MPW<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/87eb29fefbc98437a434099fe7ac9ba7" alt="" width="383" height="217"><br>The initial equilibrium income is at Y<sub>0</sub> where the AE<sub>0</sub> function cuts the 45 degree line. An increase in injections shifts the AE<sub>0</sub> function to AE<sub>1</sub> and national income is increased by the multiplied amount of times. Hence the multiplier effect shows how investment is beneficial in general. <br>Investing in rural areas has certain advantages. By diverting investments from urban to rural areas, employment in rural areas is increased to near the national average. Investment also helps to bridge the income gap and raise the standard of living of people in rural areas. Investments would also lead to development of smaller towns in the country and general development of the rural area whereby hospitals, factories, transportation, highways, railways and housing estates would be set up. There are also added advantages of diverting away investments from the urban areas to the rural areas. The city would not be so congested and air pollution would be significantly reduced. Also diverting investments to rural areas would ease the relative labor shortage and stop transmigration of people from the rural to city areas. In this way there would be a more even population distribution. The country area with all its farms would also not be neglected and there would be less pressure on large cities as resources can now be attained from the country side. These are the benefits of rural investments.</li>
<li>Economic theory assumes that a man's wants are unlimited and the resources are limited and as such, scarcity has always been a problem. Human beings have got unlimited needs in terms of goods and services and so the resources of the world have to be exploited to meet these needs. The natural state of things therefore has to be upset so that the variety of goods and services that we demand can be produced by using the resources that are there for out benefit. At the same time, human beings also have the need to live in a pleasant and sustainable environment that will not make them suffer or is destructive to them.<br>However, the problem is that there is no such economic production which is without any form of pollution or damage to the environment. There is also no economic production which goes without exhausting depletable resources. For example, in the production of the car which uses metal and iron, the elements have to be burnt so that the metal bends. In doing so air pollution results and also depletable resources like metal and iron are being used up. In another example, for a man to eat fish, a ship must sail into the ocean pulling large nets. In doing so, the ship pollutes the ocean, many other fish die and corals are also damaged. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/dc4373eb0b7b6a4e0fc1c7731281b0a6" alt="" width="488" height="543"><br>In considering whether it might be better to conserve, rather than exploit we can come to a conclusion that man needs to strike a balance between the two. We must be prepared to do away with certain goods and services that we desire so as to ensure environmentally sustainable economic development. Instead of 1000 ships going in to pollute the oceans, maybe we should just allow 300 ships. In this way water is able to replace itself as the ocean is able to sustain its natural water quality. Also, when fishing, we should only fish up to the level where fish can replenish themselves. For this human beings have to undertake studies of the environment on how much we can take such that we do not do permanent damage to the environment. In car production, we should introduce the idea of recycling metals which are depletable resources. Since petrol and gas cannot be recycled we have to do research and development to produce technology that makes a more efficient use of these resources. Quotas should be placed on activities that involve burning and polluting the atmosphere. For example, the government can issue tradable pollution permits to big factories. <br>Thus the conclusion would be to strike a balance. We cannot simply not exploit the earth's resources at all as we have needs that have to be satisfied. We also cannot exploit all the resources without control as we will end up suffering in the end due to the poisoned environment. For mankind it may not be too late to make very efficient and proper use of the world's resources by counting more on science and technology. With better science and technology, we can get a lot more from limited use of resources and production and consumption can be completely environmentally friendly. An example would be green technology which has no harmful side effects.</li>

There is, therefore, no choice. Small competitive businesses are a better means of providing for consumers' needs.</p>
<p>Do you agree with this argument?</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>I would disagree with the statement. The future of the world belongs to large firms. Competition is good because it brings out the best in entrepreneurship. But competition can come in many different forms. In my view, product development and good service is more beneficial than lower price.</p>
<p>The term large organisations refer to a market situation wherein a single producer (Monopoly) or a few sellers dominate the entire market (oligopoly). Such a situation can be or may not be in the public interest.</p>
<p>When monopoly or oligopoly exist, it is true that they are allocatively and productively inefficient, but this does not mean that they are less efficient than firms in other market structures, particularly a perfectly competitive market. This is because a monopoly or oligopoly can enjoy economies of scale (EOS). The firms in the other market situation may not. They enjoy EOS because they are the only suppliers in the market. Refer to the diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/19dd8c56b90d0616e7bc3b1210b26bf8" alt="" width="403" height="189"></p>
<p>The monopoly has an option of either producing to enjoy EOS as shown by the monopoly firm 2 or to drastically cut output as shown by the monopoly firm 1. Monopoly firm 2 enjoys EOS and produces at output level Oq<sub>3</sub>. At this level, it still makes supernormal profits as shown, but its prices, MC and AC is lower than a competitive market situation (q<sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p>This is because firms in perfectly competitive market may not enjoy EOS. Too many firms are sharing a relatively small market.</p>
<p>Large firms are undesirable only when a monopoly chooses to be at the output level of Monopoly 1. In this case, the monopoly's prices, MC and AC are higher than the perfectly competitive market and its output is lower. Consumers are worse off. The same goes for an oligopoly.</p>
<p>For certain industries, it is better to have a monopoly or near monopoly market situation. This is because there may be a need for the few or one firm to enjoy EOS. This enables the price to be affordable to consumers and profits to be made at the same time. Alternatively, there may be no output at all. Some monopolies have very high fixed costs. Competition will cause them to make losses. It is better to have production of a good being sold at a high price than to have none at all.</p>
<p>Monopolies and oligopolies are in a better position to undertake research and development. Consumers gain in the form of new and better products. New technology leads to a more efficient use of limited resources. Thus monopolies and oligopolies are not necessarily bad. They are in the public's interest. <br>However, the major drawback of a monopoly or oligopoly situation is the lack of a competitive environment. This situation leads to inefficiencies because firms resort to creating shortages, so as to make profits. This is called allocative inefficiency where P &gt; MC.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/ae62e8c07089a2d3340f4ebf6f8bb4e0" alt="" width="296" height="151"></p>
<p>In a monopoly, there is no allocative and productive efficiencies.</p>
<p>There is no productive efficiency because output is not at the minimum AC. In the long run, there will be no improvement in new technology, new products or accessories. The non-competitive situation does not provide incentive for development and innovation research.</p>
<p>When small firms dominate, the market situation is either a perfect competition or a monopolistic competition market. In a perfect competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers. All parties are price takers. The product is identical for each firm, there is perfect knowledge; freedom of entry and perfect factor mobility. The situation is highly competitive - that is price competition. In the long run, all firms make only normal profits. There is also allocative and productive efficiency. These are the positive aspects of perfect competition. However, firms in this market type cannot go far - total industry output may be small; price and unit cost still not low enough because economies of scale are not reaped. Lastly, to have a homogenous product will far from satisfying customers.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/3e84cdcb0970719a7ef8df64f179c2bf" alt="" width="371" height="165"></p>
<p>Monopolistic competition is another market situation where small firms dominate. Like perfect competitive market, there is price competition, but there is also a lot of non-price competition - advertising and free gifts. In the long run, firms make only normal profits; and the equilibrium output slightly off productive and allocative efficiency. This market structure has the same drawbacks as perfect competitive market except that, here, products are differentiated. This gives variety to consumers and, therefore, increases satisfaction.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/d85fd970594e7e8b95cc82385d752918" alt="" width="315" height="210"></p>
<p>In my opiruon the differentiation of products does not compensate for product development that large firms are able to provide.</p>
<p>Perhaps the ideal situation for a market is to have a combination of large and small firms. They keep each other 'on their toes'.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 316</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8225</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The gain in happiness when someone gets an extra dollar is much smaller when the person is rich than if they are poor.

<p>Discuss what policies a government might use in order to decrease poverty in its country.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Poverty refers to a situation where the combined income of a household is below a certain level. This is fixed by the government. Singapore has its own poverty level which is usually deemed as a level insufficient to cater to basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing. If the poverty level is kept low, this group as a percentage of the population will also be low and therefore to help the situation, the government must first and foremost identify who these people are.<br>In the short term, the government can introduce policies to redistribute income. This would help to effectively raise the average level of consumption of such people in the poverty group, above the poverty level. Progressive taxation is one such policy. By administering such taxes, the total amount of taxes paid increases more than proportionately with income and so those in the higher income brackets would be the ones to face a heavier tax burden. Heavily subsidizing goods and services bought mainly by lower income such as public housing, public transport, education, water and healthcare would also help to redistribute income and improve the poverty situation in the country. In Singapore for example, the lowest income do get subsidies from the government whereby public housing ( 1-2 room) is subsidized. Also, apart from the basic necessities, there is also government provision of public amenities like public swimming pools, playgrounds, libraries and community centres with recreational facilities. Therefore a household with an income less than $1500 would effectively be consuming $2500 of goods and services, enjoying a higher standard of living. This would all ensure that most people are well above the national&nbsp;poverty line. Transfer payments for those with very low income would also help to redistribute income in favour of the poor. Family support schemes like the school pocket money scheme in Singapore, monthly monetary handouts and government bursaries once a year to buy books and so forth, would help to decrease poverty in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a common saying which goes: "Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach him how to fish and he will eat forever." Taking Singapore into context, the government does both but adopts more of the second option. The government is more concerned with teaching a man how to fish, which is more important. The only way for social upliftment would be through education. The government can give a special package deal to a family in poverty to get them out of the poverty trap. A family trapped in the cycle of poverty would be for example, one whereby the husband and wife earn a combined salary of less than $1200, both uneducated and they have many children. Due to the low income, when the children are of working age (around 14-16 years) their parents ask them to leave school and find work to improve the household's financial situation. In the short term, income does rise but when the uneducated children reach adulthood, get married and form their own families, the family income again is not enough and thus the poverty cycle continues where they tell their own children to find jobs instead of seeking education. To break this vicious cycle the government can introduce a package deal which is accompanied by conditions. The married couple will not be allowed to ask their children to leave school, the couple must stop at 2 children and the children must be attending a government approved tuition centre like Mendaki or Sinda. The main idea is to bring them to O&nbsp;level standards. In return, the government will wave HDB and PUB payments and also school and tuition fees. The couple would also get a monetary handout per child. In this way the financial burden on parents is eased. Their children can reach the O&nbsp;level education standards and then from there attain other diplomas. They will be more qualified to enter the labor force later in life. This package would thus effectively enable them to start with a higher salary and move up the occupational ladder. With such social mobility they can give their children a better life. The poverty cycle is broken.</p>
<p>The above are only some of the schemes the Singapore government has implemented or can implement to get families out of the poverty trap.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 317</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8222</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The gain in happiness when someone gets an extra dollar is much smaller when the person is rich than if they are poor.

<p>This phenomena is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility which states that as more of a good is consumed, TU increases but increases at a falling rate.</p>
<p>The same would apply for the second good, Y. Thus the consumer would maximise his utility between 2 goods if the MU of the last unit of X is equal to the MU of the last unit of Y. That is to say: MU<sub>x</sub> = MU<sub>y</sub>. As long as the MU of the last unit of one is higher than the other's, more of the former will be consumed. However, with different prices, the consumer will&nbsp;maximise his utility by equating the ratio of MU<sub>X</sub> / P of&nbsp;one good with MU<sub>Y</sub> / P&nbsp;of the other good. Take the following example.&nbsp;</p>

The former would be eating his second apple whereas the latter would be eating his 100<sup>th.</sup>&nbsp;The second apple would give more satisfaction than the 100<sup>th</sup> one. Therefore we should; through government taxation, take from the rich and give to the poor. That is play the role of 'Robin Hood'.</p>
<p>However there is a limit to how much we should "punish the rich" and "help the poor". If taxes are too high; no one would want to be rich, in the first place; and there would be nothing to tax. Too much of free gifts would make the lower income lazy and unwilling to work hard. Therefore society has to achieve an optimal level of taxation and welfare. In this way the total amount of satisfaction or utility would be maximised.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 318</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8213</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'Governments, unlike the private sector, can create some of the necessary conditions for the efficient allocation of resources.

This means that the production of a good is at the social optimum level; that is the ideal or best level; a level that maximises the people's benefit.</p>
<p>The price mechanism is the mechanism of the market or capitalist economy. It determines what, how and for whom to produce through the interaction of buyers and sellers. The price mechanism is essentially a process by which buyers express what they want to buy and sellers respond by indicating what they are willing to sell. Their combined activities result in the prevailing market price at which the good or service is exchanged.</p>
<p>Consumers determine what will be produced through their spending decisions, or money votes. This situation is described as one where there is consumer sovereignty. Producers will then produce those goods desired, but since they are profit motivated, they will produce only those goods and services that are profitable. They will use the cheapest and most effective combinations of factors of production for maximum profit, and as such determine how the goods are produced. Those consumers who can pay the price get to enjoy these goods. As such, for whom the good is produced is also decided by the market. All these decisions are made independent of each other. In other words, decision-making is decentralized.</p>
<p>The price mechanism is the best mechanism for resource allocation in many ways. One advantage is that the mechanism can run on its own. The fact that its workings are automatic means that there is no need for costly and cumbersome artificial coordination of economic decisions. If the economy had to be run by the government or some ruling body, then massive bureaucratic costs would arise. This feature also means that the economy can respond quickly to changing demand and supply conditions.</p>
<p>It is also very efficient. The whole structure and organization of the market is the most conducive for generating wealth. People are able to work in careers of their own choice, and can invest in whatever businesses they want. Since these individuals are pursuing their own economic self-interest, and the decentralized nature of such decision-making, economic efficiency is achieved.</p>
<p>There is an optimal allocation of resources in that there is economic efficiency. In a highly competitive market situation, there will be both allocative and productive efficiency. This means that the right quantity of every commodity is produced, and they are produced at least cost. The diagram below illustrates how the conditions of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency are met through the price mechanism, given certain assumptions.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/4e8fdf34b82d007a6fd35d0f9fdc347d" alt="" width="299" height="182"></p>
<p>At output Q<sub>1</sub> price is equal to marginal cost. This means that the consumers' valuation of the good is equal to the producers' valuation of the good. Thus there is allocative efficiency. This output is also being produced on the lowest point of the average cost curve, which means that there is also productive efficiency. <br>The market system is also argued to be the best allocator of resources for society because it allows for private ownership of wealth. This prevents the government from having too much power and in doing so, safeguards the existence of personal liberty and choice. If private ownership of wealth were limited or controlled, then the ruling body would accumulate wealth and power at the expense of society.</p>
<p>However, there are many instances where the price mechanism has failed to provide the best allocation of resources. When this happens, there is said to be market failure.</p>
<p>One major disadvantage of the&nbsp;price mechanism is that it fails to provide for the poor and needy. The allocation of resources is based on a consumer's purchasing power, not need. Thus only those able to pay will get the goods and those that cannot, will have to do without them. This results in the production of luxury goods for the rich at the expense of basic necessities for the starving poor. Inequality of income and wealth also result and as such the claims of consumer sovereignty and choice now ring hollow.</p>
<p>The high level of competition that is necessary for efficient production of goods is also very often absent in the real world. The formation of monopolies and oligopolies because of the existence of barriers to entry allow firms to dominate the industry. They charge high prices and earn supernormal profits, all at the expense of consumers. Advertising and aggressive marketing also disrupts the effective workings of the price system as it distorts demand by persuading consumers or even tricking them to buy what these firms are selling.</p>
<p>Market failure also occurs because of the failure of the price mechanism in not taking into account both the explicit and implicit costs of production. Only the private costs and benefits are reflected. Thus there will not be a socially desirable level of production of goods with external costs and/or benefits. <br>Two such goods are public goods like street lighting and road sweeping. Such goods only have external benefits and thus no firm would be willing to produce it. A similar situation occurs when there is underproduction of merit goods, which are goods with both external and private benefits. On the other hand, there would be over-production or demerit goods like drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>A free market economy will also result in the so-called trade cycle, where there are periodical booms and slumps. This will result in alternating periods of unemployment and inflation. Such instability may discourage investment.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also an ethical objection, that the market economy encourages greed and materialism. People will work only for money and the high competition will drive people to do whatever it takes to be ahead. This results in ruthless and cut-throat trade and business tactics being the norm. The rewarding of self-interest behavior is what will cause this to take place.</p>
<p>Still, the price mechanism is by far the most awesome wealth-generating economic system mankind has ever known. This is true both in theory and through empirical evidence. The fall of the command economies of the world, in the Soviet Union and Communist China, further strengthens the case for the market system. However, it does have many serious disadvantages, as shown earlier. The best way to allocate resources thus seems to be to have limited government intervention in what is essentially a market economy using the price mechanism. The government can step in to help prevent or reduce the negative effects of market failures if and when it does happen.</p>

<p>A report stated that the average GDP per capita in Namibia in 2001 was US$7120, and the country was 124<sup>th</sup> out of 175 countries in the Human Development Index of the United Nations. While some countries had experienced a boom in the 1990s, 50 nations, half of them in Africa, were worse off in 2001 than in 1990, with more people going hungry and life expectancy falling. In those countries, prices of crucial exports had fallen, foreign aid had declined and the number of people with HIV/AIDS had increased. The same report also stated that in Africa 40% of the people live on less than $1 a day. This was contrasted with the amount of subsidy given to European farmers, who received $43 a day for each cow they owned.<br>The values of the Human Development Index for selected African countries were: <br>Botswana &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.614 <br>Ghana &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;0.567 <br>Malawi &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.387 <br>Mozambique &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.356 <br>Namibia &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.627 <br>South Africa &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.684 <br>Zambia &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.368 <br>Zimbabwe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.496 <br>The average value of the index for sub-Saharan Africa was 0.468. <br>In contrast, the top five countries in the index were: <br>Norway &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.944 <br>Iceland &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.942 <br>Sweden &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.941 <br>Australia &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.939 <br>Netherlands &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.938 <br>The world average was 0.722.</p>

<li>lt is the income per person, on average at national level. GDP is the value of all the goods and services produced in a country for a year. This figure is then divided by the population of that country to give the average income per person.<br><br></li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Firstly, the prices of their crucial exports in the world market were falling. These meant a drastic fall in national income for these countries. Secondly foreign aid was falling. Thirdly, the spread of HIV/AIDs must have significantly reduced the size and capability of the adult working population.<br><br></li>
<li>Firstly, it could have been a recession in the developed countries. This would cause a fall in demand for Africa's raw materials - minerals and agricultural products. African countries, largely, depend on these exports as their main foreign exchange earner. Secondly, the same recession in the developed countries may have caused these countries to cut down on foreign aid programmes in Africa. <br>However the worsening situation in Africa may be from their own doings. African governments are notoriously famous for corruption, and incompetency 40 years of foreign aid has not lifted these communities out of poverty. Africa also suffers from lack of entrepreneurial talent and good leadership in the private sector. Finally African culture of complacency and short-sightedness may have also contributed to this situation. <br><br></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In an economic boom, the rate of GDP/GNP growth would be above average. It is an upswing part of the trade or business cycle. During a boom, inflation too would be higher than normal. Thirdly, unemployment will be falling. The country may even be at full employment. During a boom, there would be more investments. If the boom is export led, then the country's balance of payment current account would be enjoying a growing surplus. A boom due to internal growth, would see a worsening current account because an increase in income due to increased domestic trade, would induce more imports.</li>
<li>If 40% of Africa live on $1 a day and European farmers get $43 a day for every cow, what more is to be said? Of course living standards are substantially higher in Europe than in Africa. The Human development index (HDI) is quite a reliable indicator of living standards. It is broad based including items like life expectancy, infant mortality, adult literacy, ownership rates of consumer durables and per capita income (GNP per head). These factors do reflect living standards. <br>Referring to the data in the article; the gap between the HDI of African and European countries is wide enough to safely conclude that the latter definitely has a higher living standard. All the European countries are above 0.9 (a score of 1 shows perfect living standards). The African countries are 40% or 50% lower than that. None come close to a 0.9 score. <br>Perhaps, it may only be the GNP per capita component of the HDI that is not reliable as an indicator. National income measures the value of all the goods and services produced in a country. Higher income means more goods for consumption and therefore a higher living standard. But in African countries; a lot of subsistence production exist. Therefore, a lot of products are unrecorded. Even if there was exchange in the market, records are not kept; nor submitted to the government. On the other hand, Europe has a high degree of labour specialisation; all production is recorded, showing a higher income per head. <br>Thus it could be that African countries may not be that worse off after all. However, the other components of the HDI are sound indicators of living standards. In conclusion, the data given is a reliable indicator of living standards between African and European countries.</li>

The terms of trade is a ratio of the price index of a basket of exports over the price index of a basket of imports expressed as an index. Thus when there is an appreciation of the exchange rate, the price index of exports in another country will rise and likewise, the price of imports in local currency will fall, Assuming ceteris paribus, the terms of trade will improve. <br>An improvement in the terms of trade will have an impact on the balance of payments of a country. If the demand for imports and exports are price inelastic, as it usually is in the short run, then there will be a net inflow of money and the balance of payments will improve. The diagrams below show this. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f1fcd968ff49a17d1be3fb33a5f0bf4e" alt="" width="329" height="217"><br>When prices rise from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, quantity demanded will fall less than proportionately, from Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2 </sub>Area A is larger than Area B, which shows that export revenue has risen in $US. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ce6745b71edb2b3cec91bf7e8912749a" alt="" width="307" height="181"><br>When prices fall from P<sub>3</sub> to P<sub>4</sub>, quantity demanded will rise less than proportionately, from Q<sub>3</sub> to Q<sub>4</sub>. Area C is larger than Area D, which shows that import expenditure has fallen in Singapore dollars. <br>However, in the long run, both the price elasticity of demand for imports and for exports will usually tend to be elastic. As such, an appreciation will lead to a deterioration of the balance of trade in the Jong run, and the country will suffer a great loss. If the country has insufficient funds to pay the deficit, then it has to borrow and be in debt. <br>The trade deficit results in a net outflow of money. In Keynesian terms these leakages causes a backward multiplier process to operate. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/2010f7f020c0ca74f2dcf72932eb0493" alt="" width="245" height="158"><br>It leads to a fall in national income from Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>2</sub>, and fall in employment. Thus living standards in the country fall. <br>Still, an appreciation can be beneficial in many ways. An appreciation of the exchange rate will reduce the price of Imports. This will make the country less susceptible to imported inflation. Thus inflation is more stable and more easily controlled. This is the situation in Singapore, where the strong Sing dollar has safeguarded it against inflation from overseas. <br>An appreciation of the exchange rate is also beneficial if the country is a creditor nation, i.e. it lends money to other countries. When its currency appreciates, the country will get back more money in terms of the other countries' currencies. Thus the real value of the money it gets back, in its own currency, though numerically equal, is now worth more in real terms. <br>Conversely, if a country is a debtor, it will be at an advantage; as it now has to repay smaller amounts of money to its creditors than before the appreciation of its exchange rate. <br>Another major benefit to a country that is brought about by an appreciation of its exchange rate is that it is now able to invest more easily overseas. The strength of its currency will make investments in other countries cheaper. Increased investments like these will result in increased future growth and wealth.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 321</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8205</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, with the aid of diagrams, how a government would maintain a fixed exchange rate.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An exchange rate refers to the external value of a country's currency. It refers to the amount of foreign currency needed to buy one unit of the local currency. For example it may take US50¢ to buy 1 Singapore dollar. <br>In the long term, it would be the free market forces of demand and supply that determines the exchange rate. However, in the short term, there are, basically, three methods from which a government can choose from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As the name implies, the exchange rate is fixed by the central bank (CB) of the country. This rate, called the official rate is maintained by constant intervention by the CB. <br>Refer to the diagram below: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/56504c4d7fe853e41b758819b9b70c4f" alt="" width="325" height="149"><br>This is the foreign exchange market for Singapore dollars expressed in US$. The official rate is US50¢ to S$ 1. Initially the market demand (Ds$) and market supply (Ss$) intersects at the official rate. <br>There is equilibrium in the market. If the demand for S$ rises froth D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> (in the diagram below); the government CB will have to increase supply from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> otherwise the market will not clear. There will be a shortage of q<sub>0</sub>q<sub>1</sub>. On the other hand, should the market supply increase the government will have to buy up its own currency in order to support it. This is done by selling away its reserves of other currencies. For this to work, it is necessary that the government maintains a buffer stock of currencies (official reserves). <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0a8c8d218cc682a6cd7bb5496c5be016" alt="" width="333" height="175"></p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 322</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：8003</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss two methods that a government might use to influence the consumption of demerit goods.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Firstly, the government can use an indirect tax to discourage consumption of a demerit good. An indirect tax or GST is payment of money to the government for each unit produced. It can be specific (a fixed sum of dollars per unit) or advalorem (% rate on the price). The tax is imposed on the producer who will push it to the consumer. As the prices rises, the quantity demanded falls: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/67831e3672f5a943c2cd047f6ab58d10" alt="" width="302" height="216"><br>The tax causes the supply to fall from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. Consumption falls from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1.&nbsp;</sub>The effectiveness of taxation depends on price elasticity of demand (PED). If PED is perfectly inelastic, there will be no fall in consumption as the consumer is willing to pay all the tax: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/79e9384dbfb7359d14fccc5f21ab18a9" alt="" width="299" height="169"><br>The tax is ineffective when PED = O; that is perfectly inelastic. <br>If the PED is perfectly elastic, the fall in the quantity consumed will be greater: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/544f67f24de39d592579cd4aa857fa67" alt="" width="285" height="402"><br>The tax is more effective when demand is price elastic.</p>
<p>Another method is to use a quota. This is a limit on the quantity allowed into the market by the government. In the diagram the original demand and supply curves were D<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>0</sub>. The equilibrium price and quantity was P<sub>0</sub> and q<sub>0</sub>.<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/083d74965048ee2d25580a0d9a3273bf" alt="" width="281" height="163"><br>The quota modifies the supply to S<sub>1</sub>. Beyond quantity Oq<sub>1,</sub>&nbsp;no further amount is allowed. The quota pushes the price up to P<sub>1</sub>. The fall in quantity to the desired level Oq<sub>1</sub> achieves the objective. <br>However, the effectiveness of the quota also depends on PED. If the demand is price elastic, the quota is more effective as compared to an inelastic demand. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5ef81e3705f8e0e5587ed10429636b91" alt="" width="264" height="371"><br>In both cases, the quantity falls to the desired level but in case (a), there is also a fall in total expenditure on the good, which is also the objective. In case (b), total spending of the good actually increases. There will be less money for other desirable goods, like merit goods. <br>The effectiveness of a quota also depends on law enforcement. Usually a black market arises when government law enforcement is ineffective. This makes the quota ineffective. The objective will not be achieved.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 323</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7996</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain, with examples, the difference between a demerit good and a merit good.

Goods can be classified into free or economic goods. The former entails no opportunity cost to people. This means that no one else is made worse off when a person consumes a free good. Examples are sea water, desert sand and air. An economic good, on the other hand, entails an opportunity cost. Some other good has to be foregone in order to create an economic good. The cause of this is scarcity, which is a situation where human demand exceeds the supply of factors needed to satisfy the demand.</p>
<p>Merit goods are classified into private goods because they are excludable and exhaustive. But merit goods have plenty of external benefits. This means that producers can earn revenue on the sale of such goods, and payers do benefit from what they pay for. But the benefit extends to society at large. Examples of merit goods are education and medicine.</p>
<p><br>Demerit goods have the features of private goods. They too have excludability. It is possible to separate the nonpayer from benefiting and the good can be finished. However, demerit goods have negative externalities. Its use by one person causes a 'loss' to a third party. For example; smoking; where non-smokers suffer the inconvenience. Drug addiction where others are at risk when addicts are intoxicated. Private car driving where too much space is taken up by one person; denying a larger group the space. The production and consumption of any good or services that causes a loss to nonparticipants is a demerit good.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 324</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7995</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss whether the demand for mobile phones (cell phones) is likely to be price-elastic or price-inelastic.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Price elasticity of demand measures the degree of responsiveness of a good to the changes in its own price. <br>Take the example of a mobile phone.

<p>In October 2003, Australia signed a trade agreement with Thailand. Under this, more than half of Thailand's 5000 import tariffs on Australian goods were abolished immediately and others were reduced. These tariffs covered Australian exports worth more than A$700 million in total. Thailand would abolish the remaining tariffs by 2020. An independent survey predicted that by 2023 these actions would raise the GDP of Australia by A$12000 million and that of Thailand by A$46000 million.</p>

<li>It is A$(2510 - 3140) = -A$630. This is a deficit for Australia.</li>
<li>Australia seems to specialise in primary mineral products and agricultural raw materials. Thailand concentrates more on manufactured goods and products in secondary production.</li>
<li>In Australia's case; it is natural endowment. The country is rich in land resources - crude oil, gold and aluminium. Australia also has lots of land for cattle farming.&nbsp;Thailand appears to have the comparative advantage in low-value manufacturing which is basically assembling foreign products. This could be due to her cheap labour, land, natural resources and currency.&nbsp;</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>In theory, it is better to remove tariffs gradually so that the structural changes would be orderly and successful. The changes also, would be with less "pain" to each side. Industries that do not have comparative advantage; against the other, would see a fall in sales, production and employment. This would be structural unemployment. Industries in Thailand and Australia with comparative advantage would grow; with more jobs created. Time would be needed to organise resources; train more workers and for investments to take place in these sun-rise industries. <br>In conclusion, a sudden removal of tariffs would be disruptive to both economies, disallowing a smoother transition. <br>However, going by the components of&nbsp;each country's exports, it may be alright to remove tariffs immediately rather than wait for 2020. This is because the two countries are not competing in the same industries. Australia does mainly primary products; Thailand does assembly of goods. Thus the sooner they remove tariffs, the sooner both sides can take advantage of cheaper imports to develop their own industries. Only in the case of small cars, some prolonged protectionism may be needed. This is because Thailand's car industry is in its infancy.&nbsp;<br>In summary, both sides should remove tariffs sooner rather than later. As given in the article; GDP of both countries will grow substantially.</li>

Governments and economists, however are more concerned with the material aspect of life - the amount of goods, people on average get to consume. Therefore, GDP can be used in this respect.</p>
<p>Firstly, the GDP of a country is calculated. This is the monetary value of all goods and services produced by a country in a given year. The GDP is deflated against the inflation rate to give the real GDP. This is then divided by the population of a country to give the per capita income or GDP per head. If this figure is $20 000, it means that on average, everybody in the country earns this amount in a year. Converted to a common currency, a country with a larger GDP per head is said to have a higher standard of living. If this figure rises over time for a country, then its living standard has improved.</p>
<p>Economists, cannot have full confidence on this method for many reasons. Firstly the accuracy of the GDP figures are questionable. This depends on the degree of specialisation in a country. If specialisation is not there, then a great chunk of goods and services never pass through the market and therefore never recorded. This is the case for most third world countries like China. How is the government to know what was produced and consumed in one's living room, kitchen and backyard? Even if goods were exchanged, money may not have been used, or even if money was used, it was not recorded, and even if recorded, it was not submitted to the government. Sometimes even the government's statistics department is incompetent in dealing with such data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, no two countries have an identical method in calculating GDP. The more different there are, the less compatible they are for comparison. Countries defer in what are transfer payments and they do not recognise all goods and services in a country. In Saudi Arabia, liquor is banned, even if it may be produced and consumed. Governments also differ on accounting ways for public goods and merit goods; the market forces are unable to reflect their value. Quite often, some developing countries even downplay their national income figures so as to be eligible for UN aid.</p>
<p>Even in developed economies, computing GDP figures may be a problem. Companies and individuals may under declare their incomes, so as to avoid taxes. Moonlighting is a serious problem in the UK and Germany.</p>
<p>GDP per head, in itself has limitations no matter how accurately calculated. It is only a mathematical average. Income distribution can never be equal among all the people in a country. Therefore, if distribution is very unequal, the GDP per head figure would be an exaggeration of living standards. GDP figures do not show the types of goods produced. It is only consumer goods that provide current benefit to society. Countries such as Iraq and Cuba have very large expenditure on the military. Japan and Singapore spend a lot on capital goods. Countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia tend to save up a large portion of their GNP. Therefore the high per capita income, again, exaggerates current standards of living.</p>
<p>The GDP per head figures do not include the negative externalities generated due to economic development. Pollution of the air and water, congestion and the damage of the environment are heavy costs on society, which undermine the people's living standard.</p>
<p>Another factor that the GDP figures fail to reflect is the amount of work people put in to earn that level of income. A country whose GDP per head is twice that of another country, but who puts in three times the effort cannot be said to have a higher standard of living. It is for this reason that one can question Japan's high standard of living. The Japanese, literally, work themselves to death.</p>
<p>Another factor is the cost of living. A country may have a larger GDP per head, but if the prices of goods and services are equally high, then living standards are actually lower. Singapore's GDP per head is higher than Malaysia's but housing, food, transport and utility are expensive in Singapore.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that only for lack of a better method, GDP per head is universally used to compare living standards between countries. This method can be misleading and, therefore, it cannot be presented with full confidence.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 327</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7980</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain two methods of calculating gross domestic product used in national income statistics.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>There are 3 ways to calculate gross domestic product (GDP) - the expenditure, income and output methods. I shall elaborate on the first two.</p>
<p>GDP is a measure of the value of output of goods and services produced by an economy over a period of time. The income approach measures the national income by adding the total income generated. The expenditure method measures national income by adding the expenditures needed to purchase all the final goods and services. The expenditure approach consists of four parts.</p>
<p>The personal consumption expenditure (C), the government expenditure on goods and services (G), the gross private domestic investment (I) and net exports (X - M). The personal consumption expenditure consists of expenditure on durable goods and services.</p>
<p>The government expenditure on goods and services consist of expenditure by the government departments on goods and services. These may include consumer or capital goods.</p>
<p>Gross domestic private investments fall into two categories; that is, plant and equipment, and changes in inventories. Residential construction is also included as an investment because it is built to gain income.</p>
<p>Plant and equipment is the construction of factories, warehouses, stores and other non-residential structures.</p>
<p>Changes in inventories are the changes in stocks i.e. goods that are stocked up and not used in the production process or consumed. A negative change would show a disinvestment while a positive would mean an investment. Net exports is the value of total exports minus the value of total imports.</p>
<p>The addition of all these would give GDP at market prices as shown below:</p>
<p>+ Personal consumption expenditure (C)<br>+ Government expenditure on goods and services (G), <br>+ Gross private domestic investment (I) <br>+ Net exports (X - M).<br>= Gross Domestic Product at market price</p>
<p>The income approach is the addition of wages, rents, interests and profits. The addition of wages and salaries of labour including those of the self-employed, net interest payments on the use of capital, the interest received by households, the rent earned for the use of land, farms and houses, the gross corporate profits including those profits earned by the country at factor cost. The addition of profits earned by government activities minus transfer payments, social securities and unemployed benefits. This type of personal income is not earned by doing work or services. Stock appreciation is subtracted because if there is an increase in the general price level, the value of stock rises without a real increase in output. The total of these values give GDP at factor cost.</p>
<p>The main difference in the two methods is in their part in the circular flow of income. In this flow, all output is equal to expenditure, which in turn will be equal to income. The expenditure method is on the spending side of the flow whereas the income method is on the receiving side of the flow. The second difference is that the expenditure method gives GDP at market prices whereas the income method gives GDP at factor cost right away.</p>
<p>The income method also has a serious problem of double counting. This is due to transfer payments which are payments to no work done. As a method, all transfer payments are to be excluded.</p>
<p>These are the 2 methods of calculating GDP.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 328</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7979</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the assertion that the market system is not able to allocate resources efficiently.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The price mechanism is the mechanism of the market or capitalist economy. It determines what, how and for whom to produce through the interaction of buyers and sellers. The price mechanism is essentially a process by which buyers express what they want to buy and sellers respond by indicating what they are willing to sell. Their combined activities result in the prevailing market price at which the good or service is exchanged.</p>
<p>Consumers determine what will be produced through their spending decisions, or money votes. This situation is described as one where there is consumer sovereignty. Producers will then produce those goods desired, but since they are profit motivated, they will produce only those goods and services that are profitable. They will use the cheapest and most effective combinations of factors of production for maximum profit, and as such determines how the goods are produced. Those consumers who can pay the price get to enjoy these goods. As such, for whom the good is produced is also decided by the market. All these decisions are made independent of each other. In other words, decision making is decentralized and independent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price mechanism is the best mechanism for resource allocation in many ways. One advantage is that the mechanism can run on its own. The fact that its workings are automatic means that there is no need for costly and cumbersome artificial coordination of economic decisions. If the economy had to be run by the government or some ruling body, then massive bureaucratic costs would rise. TI1is feature also means that the economy can respond quickly to changing demand and supply conditions.</p>
<p>It is also very efficient. The whole structure and organization of the market is the most conducive for generating wealth. People are able to work in careers of their own, and can invest in whatever businesses they want. Since these individuals are pursuing on their own economic self-interest, and the decentralized nature of such decision making economic, efficiency is achieved.</p>
<p>There is an optimal allocation of resources in that there is economic efficiency. In a highly competitive market situation, there will be both allocative and productive efficiency. This means that the right quantity of every commodity is produced, and they are produced at least cost. The diagram below illustrates how the condition of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency are met through the price mechanism, given certain assumptions. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/42f9a466ec18f1c361f6cb15944c3a2e" alt="" width="247" height="114"><br>At output q<sub>1</sub>, price is equal to Marginal Cost. This means that the consumers' valuation of the good is equal to the producer's valuation of the good. Thus there is allocative efficiency. The output is also being produced on the lowest point of the average cost curve, which means that there is also productive efficiency. The market system is also argued to be the best allocator of resources for society because it allows for private ownership of wealth. This prevents the government from having too much power and in the doing so, safeguards the existence of personal liberty and choice. If private ownership of wealth were limited or controlled, then the ruling body would accumulate wealth and power at the expense of society.</p>
<p>However there are many instances where the price mechanism has failed to provide the best allocation of resources. When this happens there is said to be a market failure.</p>
<p>One major disadvantage of the price mechanism is that it fails to provide for the poor and needy. The allocation of resources is based on a consumer's purchasing power, not need. Thus only those able to pay will get the goods and those that cannot will have to do without them. This results in the production of luxury goods for the rich at the expense of basic necessities of the starving poor. Inequality of income and wealth also result and as such the claims of consumer sovereignty and choice now ring hollow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The high level of competition that is necessary for efficient production of goods is also very often absent in the real world. The formation of monopolies and oligopolies because of the existence of barriers to entry allow firms to dominate the industries and charge high prices and earn supernormal profits. All at the expense of consumers. Advertising and aggressive marketing also disrupts the effective workings of the price systems as it distorts demand by persuading consumers and even tricking them to buy what these firms are selling.</p>
<p>Market failure occurs because of the failure of the price mechanism in taking into account both the explicit and implicit costs of production. Only the private costs and benefits are reflected. Thus there will not be a socially desirable level of production of goods with external costs and/or benefits.</p>
<p>One such typed good is the public good like street lighting and road sweeping. Such goods only have external benefits and thus no firm would be willing to produce them. A similar situation occurs when there is underproduction of merit goods, which are goods with both external and private benefits. On the other hand, there would be over production of demerit goods like drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>A free market economy will also result in the so called trade cycle, where there are periodical booms and slumps. This will result in alternating periods of unemployment and inflation. Such instability may discourage investment.</p>
<p>Finally there is also an ethical objection: that the market economy encourages greed and materialism. People will work only for money and the high level of competition will drive people to do whatever it takes to be ahead. This results in ruthless and cut throat trade and business tactics being the norm. The rewarding of self interest behavior is what will cause this to take place.</p>
<p>Still, the price mechanism is by far the most awesome wealth generating economic system mankind has ever known. This is true both in theory and through empirical evidence. The fall of the command economies of the world, in the Soviet Union and Communist China, further strengthens the case for the market system. However, it does have many serious disadvantages as shown earlier. The best way to allocate resources thus seems to be to have limited government intervention in what is essentially a market economy using the price mechanism. The government can step in to help prevent or reduce the negative effects of market failures if and when they do occur.</p>

In the same period, its sales increased by 11 % as there was increased demand for its Sensor3 and Mach3 Turbo razors and a reduction in the price of Duracell batteries, which Gillette produces. However, Gillette faces strong competition from Energizer Holdings, which sells batteries and Schick razors. Energizer introduced a new four-blade razor in September 2002 and increased its advertising and product promotion. Gillette lost US market share and announced it planned to increase expenditure on marketing.</p>
<p>Explain how firms are said to behave in oligopolistic markets and discuss how far this is supported by the above statement.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The shaving or razor industry would normally be classified as an oligopoly market situation. This is due to the following reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are only a few dominant suppliers. In the US market, the two dominant suppliers are Gillette and Energizer, although there are many other smaller companies. The latter have a smaller share of the market. Even in Singapore there are many razor firms, but the bulk of the market is dominate by Gillette. A major characteristic of an oligopoly is a high market concentration.</p>
<p>Secondly, the decision making of each and every company is interdependent of one another. No one firm would dare raise the price alone because they would lose a significant part of the market share. The demand above the market price is elastic. Likewise no one would want to lower his price because that would only compel others to do so. In the end the increase in quantity demanded for each company will be smaller in relation to the fall in price. TR falls. Thus the firm's demand curve is kinked, as shown below.</p>

<p>Indeed there is a greater likelihood of price cooperation rather than competition. Firms tend to gain by forming a cartel. A cartel fixes the price floor that all members must accept. It may also fix a quota for each member. In this way all firms make a higher profit per unit sold. If the market concentration is very high, then the main supplier acts as a market or price leader. He can either raise or lower the price; expecting the others to follow.</p>
<p>Because of price fixing, a third characteristic of an oligopoly is non-price competition. Companies resort to advertising, image building, branding and packaging. In this way, they increase their monopolistic influence on consumers. The larger firms strengthen their positions in the market by offering a wider variety of goods and services, after sales services and guarantees.</p>
<p>A forth characteristic of an oligopoly is the existence of barriers to entry. Established companies are able to keep new companies out because they enjoy economies of scale. Their products are trusted. Their sales network are more extensive and sophisticated. They offer a wider range of goods and services in the form of providing spare parts and more outlets. Buying from an established company gives the customer exclusiveness. Finally, as given in the example, oligopoly industries have every high fixed costs (start up costs). Opening up a new firm to compete with a very established one involves millions of dollars. Thus not many companies can come in or would want to come in - considering the cost and risk.</p>
<p>The long run equilibrium of an oligopoly is typical:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/fd811c0f6c68f230baffb52091300f9d" alt="" width="318" height="157"></p>
<p>It makes supernormal or abnormal profits. If we assume that Gillette and Energizer commands brand loyalty, then they would both face an inelastic demand curve all the way:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c550f1e87ed2a538f4c1e80f313fc3c0" alt="" width="323" height="149"></p>
<p>An oligopoly firm that enjoys brand loyalty makes supernormal profits.</p>
<p>The above description is typical of oligopoly behavior. Gillette is making huge profits and has been increasing its market sales (11 %). Energizer, too enjoys the same. The market is a unique duopoly. Both firms are spending a lot on research and development, always coming up with new models, new features, design and technology. It is a 4-blade razor now for energizer. Therefore its market share increases. Gillette will go back to the drawing board and come out with a new model. Consumers will see new models from the two rivals every few years.</p>
<p>The two firms also spend large amounts of money on marketing-advertising, free gifts and other promotional activities. It can run into millions of dollars. This is typical of large oligopolies. They are able to do this because the cost is spread out over a very large quantity in the US and in the world.</p>
<p>It is typical of oligopoly not to engage in price wars. However, in the case of razors, who would really care about brand? No one sees the razor brand in our toilets. Therefore if one firm cuts the prices, the other would follow. A price war would not benefit both firms because, both face an inelastic demand for a cut in price. People do not need to buy more razor blades. This is why there is no mention of a price cut by any of the two firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is just product development and effective marketing, without cutting price. This is how oligopolies behave. </p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 330</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7969</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>In August 2003 the US dollar rose in value against the euro as reports showed that Europe's economy failed to grow and Germany even fell into a recession.</p>

<li>The 'US dollar rose' means that it grew in strength against other major currencies; its external value grew. <br>For example, US $1 = £2 to US $1 = £3. <br>This is an appreciation of the US$ by 50%. Assuming a freely fluctuating exchange rate system, the rise may be due to an increase in US$ demand, a fall in US$ supply or both:<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/373fd4b7f206a3c7e187b4f5b501124c" alt="" width="373" height="546"><br>The rise in US$ may be due to stronger demand for US goods; increased competitiveness of US products; higher interest rates in US; a US government contractionary budget surplus and speculation in favour of the US$. <br>'Europe's economy failed' would mean that macro economic objectives have not been achieved. Economic growth measured by real increases in GDP and GNP fell short. Unemployment remained high, above the acceptable level, new jobs were not on target; inflation not on target, either too high or too low; and finally the BOP current account was in a deficit. This is the meaning of a 'failed economy'. <br>A recession is an economic downturn; where the level of economic activity is below normal. It is part of the downturn trend of the trade or business cycle. Its also called cyclical unemployment, Keynesian or demand deficient unemployment. <br>Technically two quarters of negative GDP growth is a recession. <br>In a recession, GDP growth is below normal or even negative. Unemployment is high, retrenchments are common and prices are falling. Investments would be nil; individuals going bankrupt and firms going bust. <br>In a recession, expectations are bad, causing a fall in expenditure. This causes prices to fall. To stop the trend of falling prices, firms cut back production. This means no overtime or lay offs; incomes fall; spending falls; prices falls and the process repeats itself. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/8fea9325c37e2772b0464fd82777b75e" alt="" width="364" height="179"><br>The diagram shows the business cycle.</li>
<li>It is possible for the German government to deal with cyclical fluctuations. However, government measures may not be as efficient as desired. In dealing with both an inflationary or recessionary situation, there are factors that undermined government measures. There are also time lags. Using the Keynesian model, a country will come out of a recession with sufficient injections of demand into the economy. An injection of money through the multiplier effect leads to a multiple increase in income. <br>Prices will rise and employment will be increasing in order to meet the rising demand. Eventually the country comes out of the recession. <br>The German government maintains a high level of demand through fiscal policy, monetary policy and direct controls. In the case of fiscal measures, the government may lower taxes in order to reduce the fall in disposable income. The tax rates can be increased and thresholds raised. For the unemployed, the government as part of welfare, gives them unemployment handouts. All these help to keep demand from falling further. <br>On the expenditure side, the government maintains all public projects and obligations. The government may even embark on new public projects for the same purpose of keeping demand strong. <br>On the monetary side, the government may use quantitative and qualitative tools to increase the money supply. This will lower the interest rate and thus consumer expenditure and business investments. The central bank can lower its lending rate, buy up government securities and relax regulations on reserve ratios and special deposits. All controls on mortgage, deferred payments and hire purchases can be relaxed in order to stimulate demand. <br>In the case of direct controls, CPF (compulsory savings) contributions by employees and employers can be reduced, the government can allow a lower age for CPF withdrawals. The consumption of certain goods and services can be made compulsory. Examples are estate, cars and machinery maintenance.&nbsp;<br>However, getting out of a recession may not be that simple. A recession prevails because of negative expectations. Consumers and producers believe that times will get worse. Demand, therefore falls further, leading to more stocks accumulation and more retrenchment. Thus they would save even more to last out the bad times. The increase in money supply brought about by the government expansionary policy is, therefore, simply leaked away. <br>Leakages may also come in the form of imports and export of capital. The former is unlikely but the latter happens because the rich seeks their fortune in other countries where economies are booming. <br>In order to bring its economy out of a recession, the German government has to ensure that conditions are favourable. The government would have to cap all leakages. This can be done by reassuring the public that the economy is picking up. Publishing economic indicators would convince the business class of rising demand. The government may also have to ban the export of capital. <br>Another problem is that production may not be able to expand, if the infrastructure of the economy has deteriorated or if there are still labour management problems. The government would have to remove all such 'bottle-necks' by intervening directly into the markets. <br>Perhaps a more serious problem facing a government is financing a budget deficit. How is a government going to spend more than it collects? It will have to borrow, which would be difficult domestically (incomes have already fallen). If it borrows externally, it has been argued that, the recession has been postponed to a later date. This is because the government will have to pay back even more in the future. The increases in taxes and reduction in expenditure in the future may bring back the recession. <br>These are some of the ways and difficulties for the German government in dealing with a cyclical downturn. <br><br></li>

<li>We shall assume that this is a rise in autonomous consumption. An increase in consumer spending will probably lead to a multiple increase in national income. This is called the multiplier process as part of the Keynesian Theory of Income Determination and Employment. The multiplier process (k) asserts that an increase in autonomous demand or injection into a country's circular flow of income will lead to a more than proportionate increase in output and employment. The former can come in the form of investments, exports, government spending and even autonomous consumption. The multiplier process can be expressed as: k = ΔY / ΔAD;&nbsp;Y is income and AD is aggregate demand.&nbsp;<br><br>The multiplier principle is based on the argument that demand creates its own supply. When there is demand, prices will rise. This will cause suppliers to increase production because they are profit motivated. Secondly, the principle is based on the argument that one man's expenditure will be another man's income, which in tum will become expenditure and so on. The process continues until it diminishes because there are leakages after each round. <br><br>To illustrate the multiplier process we shall assume it is a 4-sectcr economy with consumers, producers, government and foreign trade. There are unemployed resources. All citizens have a marginal propensity to save of 0.2, marginal propensity to import of 0.2 and a marginal propensity to tax of 0.1. This means that out of every $100 earned, $50 will be leaked away. Next we shall assume the economy to be in equilibrium. Finally consumption increases by $200m. The impact of the above on the economy is given in the table below: <br><br>

<br>When the consumers spends $200m, the economy will start off work and produce goods and services worth $200m. The factors of production that earn these $200 will spend will spend $100m of it on other goods and services. The withdrawal in the first round of production was $40m of savings, $40m of imports and $20m of tax. The process continues until the increased withdrawals equal the earlier injection of $200m. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>The process can be summarized by:&nbsp;<br><br>k = ΔY/ΔAD; k = 1/(mps+mpm+mrp) = 1/0.5 =2<br>ΔY = ΔJ×k =&nbsp;$200m&nbsp;× 2 =$400m<br><br>The national income will eventually increase by $400m. Diagramatically, the process is: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/60f8b826486d5b88b0ff79984741d96f" alt="" width="354" height="163"><br><br>The aggregate demand shifted from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> due to consumer spending (C<sub>0</sub> to C). The economy grew from Ye<sub>1</sub> to Ye<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br>This is how an increase in consumer spending will lead to a higher level of national income.</li>
<li>Every tourist dollar is an injection of money into the country's circular flow of income. It sets off the multiplier effect, causing a rise in national income and employment. The effect is the same as the increase in autonomous consumption given in part (a). <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7df36add97250fd1b0383008e398ebbb" alt="" width="311" height="171"><br><br>National income increases by a multiple due to a rise in consumption. <br><br>A higher level of national income (GDP) leads to many benefits. Firstly, the living standards of the people can be improved. Through progressive taxation and government spending on public and merit goods; income will be redistributed. The extra income can be retrieved into further economic expansion. It can be saved for the future or invested abroad. <br><br>Another benefit of tourism is that it diversifies the economy, especially for a developing country. Such a country depends to much on primary production. It may not be in a position to go into manufacturing. Tourism is feasible because the country is rich in natural attractions and culture. Indeed it is an easy and good earner of foreign exchange. Diversification gives the country greater stability and security. <br><br>Tourism is one of the few tertiary industries that create a lot of jobs. It absorbs the young and fairly educated labour force of a developing country. Most service industries are good earners but do not create many jobs. Tourism is an exception. Jobs are created in hotels; transport; places of attraction, the food industry and in entertainment. It also boost some areas of manufacturing souvenirs, clothes and art pieces. <br><br>Tourism improves a country's balance of payments. rt is an export, the money earned helps to pay for imports. When a country opens up its natural attraction and treasures to the world, it attracts foreign investments. These includes 5-star hotels, shopping centres and airlines. FDIs give a boost to the local economy. It brings in risk capital; technology, creates more jobs; brings training and gives rise to local supporting industries. FDIs lead to a transfer of managerial know how. Local employees earn income and government collects taxes. Economic growth is accelerated. <br><br>In conclusion, tourism helps to achieve three of the macroeconomic objectives - economic growth, full employment and a healthy balance of payments. For low income and middle income developing countries, it is an easy way to earn foreign exchange. <br><br></li>

<li>The MRP theory assumes perfect competition in the labour market. A perfect competition labor market means that there are many employers and many sellers (workers) who offer their labour services. All players are wage takers. Labour is homogenous; there is a perfect knowledge and freedom of entry into the labour market. There is also perfect mobility of labour from one occupation to another.<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f72aa1af36bd09ed59750e3b108e3840" alt="" width="508" height="215"><br><br>The forces of demand (D<sub>0</sub>) and supply (S<sub>0</sub>) for labour fixes the rate at W<sub>0</sub>. All employers will have to pay this rate regardless of the quantity of labour employed. The market or industry demand for labour is sloping downwards because of the law of Diminishing Marginal Returns. The MP for labour falls as more are employed. The demand itself can shift if the productivity (MPP) improves or if the demand for the finished good (MR = price) increases. The labour supply is upward sloping because workers are profit motivated (maximise income). The size of supply itself is determined by the size of population and labour force. Education opportunities, government and union policies, and the preferences of workers are influenced by intangible and tangible considerations. <br><br>Next, the MRP theory which assumes perfect competition, shows us the profit maximizing level of employment. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/897275652cd30de11d23c8b5e3da566f" alt="" width="361" height="139"><br><br>The marginal revenue productivity theory (MRP) seeks to explain how wages are determined in an industry. The theory is based on the following terms. <br>Firstly, the marginal revenue product, MRP, is the increase in revenue due to employing one more unit of labour. The marginal physical product, MPP, is the increase in output when one more worker is employed. The AR or average revenue is the price of the finished product. Due to the Law of Diminishing Marginal returns, LDMR, the MPP eventually falls as more workers are employed to work on the given amount of fixed factor. In a perfectly competitive market, the AR remains constant. Therefore a firm, in the short-run may experience production and revenue as follows. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/0616c4a59084d2644da10f0d48a0cceb" alt="" width="445" height="271"><br><br>When more workers are employed, the MRP eventually falls. The MRP is determined by the MPP multiplied by the AR. It will look like: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/bf49b8e13fd93d9ba5abf81e49daaf27" alt="" width="319" height="149"><br><br>The downward sloping portion of the MRP is the demand for labour by firms. <br><br>The supply curve of the firm is the average factor cost (AFC) of labour. If it is a perfectly competitive labour market, the AFC will equal the marginal factor costs (MFC). Firms can employ an unlimited number of similar workers at the same wage rate. This is shown as follows: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/ab022b8ba59fcb86ea49208cabdf9a46" alt="" width="470" height="239"><br><br>The supply curve of labour will look like: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/3840b9c9b1ab3d058c7252fd43d05c47" alt="" width="358" height="141"><br><br>The equilibrium level or profit maximizing level of output is where the MRP cuts the MFC from above. In the diagram below, the profit maximizing firms will employ workers up to q<sub>1</sub>. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/2601033a41d5bddb86a6db7704e9810b" alt="" width="351" height="144"><br><br>Wage rate is at W<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br>As long as every additional worker adds more to revenue than costs, the firm will continue employing. Thus the equilibrium is where the wage rate (MFC) equals the MRP, which is determined by the MPP multiplied by the price of good: <br><br>WR (Wage Rate) = MRP = MPP x P (MR)</li>
<li>The MRP theory assumes perfect competition. Therefore the marginal revenue productivity theory may not be very useful in explaining wages in the real world. It is a theory based on a number of assumptions which may not be realistic; thus making the theory itself unrealistic. <br><br>Firstly, the MRP assumes that all resources are homogenous, that is, equally efficient. In the real world, this is not so. For example, workers cannot be homogenous because of differences in innate abilities, skills and capabilities. <br><br>The theory assumes that the marginal physical product (MPP) of a factor of production can be measured. It is not possible with certain factors, to estimate their contribution in terms of actual physical units. Examples are teachers, nurses, doctors and service occupations. There is no immediate and definite physical product resulting from their work. <br><br>Thirdly, in some production processes, a factor must be combined in fixed proportions, due to technical reasons. It is difficult to separate the contribution from each factor. For example, a miner and a pick. It is difficult to say how much of the additional total production should be attributed to the extra labour and how much to the extra machine employed. <br><br>The above points are some factors which show the weakness of the MRP theory which assumes a perfect competition situation. In the real world, labour markets are far from a perfect competition situation. In developed countries, trade unions are strong enough to set minimum wages and limit entrants into their own industries. These keep wages high. In a more socialist country, government themselves impose a national minimum wage. Often this wage rate is higher than the market equilibrium.&nbsp;<br><br>Other factors which explain why wages differ are as follows: firstly, in some firms, workers are compensated not just in money form but in kind. They get medial benefits, dental, more leaves, sports and recreational facilities. As a result, wages are lower. Secondly, wages differ because of discrimination. It can be based on sex, race and nationality. Sometimes discrimination is even endorsed by governments. In countries like Saudi Arabia an Pakistan, men are paid more than women so as to preserve the family institution. In Malaysia, bumiputras are paid more than other races so as to enable the former to catch up on economic standing. <br><br>Employers may pay differently because of difference in cost of living and the exchange rate. A manager of SIA in Paris will be paid more than one posted to Dhaka because living costs are higher in Paris. Foreign workers in Singapore coming from Indonesia are paid much less than their Singapore counterpart because the currency of the former is much lower. They get thousands of Rupiah for every one Singapore dollar paid to them. <br><br>Finally wages differ in practice, simply because of ignorance. In the real world, the market is a situation of imperfect knowledge. Worker A did not know that worker B is paid more for the same job, in the same firm. Wages are usually kept confidential. <br><br>In conclusion, we can say that the assertion of the question is true. In the real world, we do no have a perfect competition labour market.</li>

<p>The Botswana government wishes to use the wealth that the country obtains from diamonds to diversify its economy. Botswana is the world's largest producer of diamonds, which accounted for 77% of the country's export earnings and 45% of GDP in 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diamond industry is controlled by one company, Debswana, which is a partnership between De Beers (a private sector company) and the Botswana government. Each owns 50% of Debswana but De Beers keeps 75% of the profits.</p>
<p>Botswana has various incentives for investors. The corporate tax rate is one of the lowest in Africa at 15% and profits can easily be sent back to the home country because there are no exchange controls. Wage rates are relatively low and the workforce is the most educated in Africa. Botswana is also perfectly located to become a financial hub for the 200 million people in the 14 African countries in the Southern African Development Community.</p>
<p>However, there are problems for investors. Usable water is in short supply and transport costs are high. Labour is also in short supply because the population is only 1.7 million and life expectancy is only 39.</p>
<p>Despite its problems, Botswana remains an example of prosperity in conflict-ridden Africa. US President George W Bush said 'Botswana has demonstrated sure, sound economic administration and a commitment to free market principles.'</p>

<li>The country offers very low corporate taxes and relatively cheap labour. <br><br></li>
<li>Firstly, the economy depends on primary production - 45% of GDP and 77% of all exports. Secondly, the living standards are very low; given that life expectancy is only 39 years. The passage also tells us that usable water is short, implying that such basic amenities are yet to be established. <br><br></li>
<li>It appears to be a monopoly because there is only one firm doing the mining in Botswana; Debswana. We can assume that the market for buying diamonds in Botswana has only one seller; therefore a monopoly. However, Botswana mostly exports her diamonds into the world market. Here, it is not a monopoly because there are other producers of diamonds as well. <br><br>Debswana would be a natural monopoly because mining has a very high fixed cost infra structure. Its diagram would be: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5df0eb32c550b910ffd60859d19d7325" alt="" width="321" height="164"><br><br>AC and MC are falling because of the high fixed costs. Profit maximizing would be at q<sub>c</sub> and the price at P<sub>c</sub> (MC = MR). &nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li>President Bush's 'free market principles' refer to the private ownership of wealth; freedom of choice and enterprise; profit motive, minimal government intervention in business and the workings of the price mechanism. <br><br>The free forces of demand and supply dictate the allocation of resources. <br><br>Botswana is not a free enterprise economy but it seems to be moving in that direction. The country's only major industry - diamonds, is government owned and managed. There are no plans to privatize it. <br><br>However, Botswana is opening up to foreign investors. The government has cut corporate taxes to a mere 15%, there is guaranteed movement of capital and no exchange controls. <br><br></li>
<li>A developing country like Botswana depends heavily on primary production. It earns very little. Finished products cost many times more. <br>By diversifying, the country can move into secondary and tertiary industries. Manufacturing creates a lot of new jobs; especially low value labour intensive manufacturing. A developing country has a rapidly growing population. Thousands of people enter the labour market early in life. They can be absorbed into these factories. For services, tourism can also create new jobs for the young population. Developing countries have a lot of natural attractions, making tourism feasible. They may not have the technology and know-how for other industries. <br><br>Diversification into secondary and tertiary industries increases income. Living standards can improve. Much of the money can be used to provide better housing, medical facilities, education and public amenities. <br><br>The new income can also be used to plough back into further investments and infrastructure. <br><br>Having more industries make the country more stable and secure. Over reliance on primary production is very unstable because the world prices of such products keep on fluctuating, very often in a downward trend. <br><br>All developing countries have little choice but to move into secondary and tertiary industries. However these move is not without problems and risks. Only too often new projects fail. This is due to lack of managerial skills, low labour productivity, political instability, corruption and failure to compete in world markets. The end results are a wastage of the country's resources and funds, and the creation of external debts. <br><br>Therefore developing countries have to choose wisely the right industries to go into. They should not be over ambitious.</li>

A modem society simply, will not be able to function without money. Inflation causes money to lose its value.</p>
<p>Inflation means a rise in the general price level and therefore a fall in the value of money. As to whether this fall will affect the functions of money depends on the degree of the fall. If the inflation is mild, it will not at all affect the functions of money. Although the holder of money loses because of its falling value, the advantages of using money still outweigh that of using barter. In our present day society people charge or earn interest when money is used as a store of value and a standard for deferred payment. As long as the interest rate is above the inflation rate, money will not lose its function.</p>
<p>It is only when the inflation rate is too high; called hyperinflation, that money may lose its functions. An inflation rate higher than the interest rate means that the real rate of interest is negative. People will give up holding their wealth as a store of value or to offer credit. They would be losing if they did so. In exceptional cases, people even give up using money as a medium of exchange. Not that they return to barter, but they would, probably adopt another country's currency as their money.</p>
<p>Inflation affects the distribution of real income in many ways. Firstly, fixed income earners are made effectively poorer. This is because their money incomes remain the same - they are unable to obtain increases. When prices rise their basket of goods became smaller. Profit-earners are in a better position to gain or protect themselves against inflation. When prices rise, the prices of their products rise too. They take the opportunity to raise prices even when their cost of production has not. Therefore they become richer in real terms. Other profit earners who are affected by the inflation protect themselves by raising the prices of their products or service. Therefore their real incomes remain the same.</p>
<p>Secondly, inflation affects the wealthy in different ways depending on how they hold their assets. Those who save in the form of cash in the drawer clearly lose because their money's real value falls. Those who store wealth in the form of current accounts, non-interest monetary assets, and post-dated cheques lose again. However, those who have bonds and fixed-deposit accounts may still gain if the interest rate is higher than the inflation rate. However, their real interest rate is lower now. They would be losers if the inflation rate exceeds their nominal interest rates.</p>
<p>Only holders of non-monetary assets like houses, land, cars, shares, and precious metals gain because during inflations, the prices of these rise. <br>Finally, during inflation debtors gain and creditors lose. This is because the real value of loans paid back is lower than the nominal value. For example, a man who borrowed $1000 in period 1 was able to buy 1000 apples but the $1100 he returned in period 2 (10% interest charge) could only buy 90 apples because the price of apples rose at a rate faster than the interest charged. Thus the creditors have the right to adjust the interest charged according to the inflation rate. This is how inflation affects income distribution in a country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A high rate of inflation in most countries would mean that prices in general are rising at more than 10% a year. A high rate of inflation can have serious consequences for the economy. Firstly, producers may lose competitiveness. The high prices will affect most people in that their real incomes fall. Salaried workers will, through their strong trade unions, demand higher wage increases. Should companies give in, they would have to raise their prices to meet the higher wage claim. This only worsens the inflation. Other workers and even self-employed personnel will seek higher incomes for the same reason. The situation settles into a wage-price increase spiral. Eventually the profit and revenue of local companies fall. When companies close down, workers lose their jobs.</p>
<p>On the international scene, the country loses its competitiveness as well. The growth of exports slows down and may even fall. At the same time imports grow faster. The country's terms of trade have improved which, in the long run, gives a worsening balance of payments on the current account. This deficit, if it is persistent, will develop into a large and serious national debt. It is serious because an external debt can be a claim on the future generation. A fall in export earnings lowers the standard of living in the country and again, creates unemployment.</p>
<p>A high rate of inflation also causes savings to fall in the country. If we assume a constant demand for money, the rate of interest rises. A higher rate of interest worsens inflation because those whose demand for loans is interest inelastic will have to seek higher wages and raise prices (for the self-employed) to meet the higher interest payment. But more importantly, the high interest rates discourage investments. If investments fail to grow or even falls, then economic growth stagnates. Job creation falls and may not keep pace with the increasing labour force. As a result, output does not grow as fast or may even fall. Unemployment increases. Living standards fall.</p>
<p>The high rate of inflation, forces local companies to relocate overseas in order to remain competitive. It also discourages foreign investors. The country is no longer a hub for foreign investments because of the high labour costs and high cost of living. The country is denied foreign funds, technological transfers and jobs that foreign investments bring. The impact of this is the same as mentioned.</p>
<p>This is how high inflation may affect a country's output, employment and prosperity. <br><br></p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 335</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7673</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain why economies make use of money.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Money has many functions and these are the reason for using it.</p>
<p>The most important function of money is to act as a medium of exchange. This means that all goods and services can be exchanged for this commodity, called money. Everybody accepts because the commodity can be exchanged again for other goods and services. This function solves the cumbersome problem of satisfying the double coincidence of wants that barter requires.</p>
<p>Money also acts as a store of wealth. Traditionally a rich man could store his wealth in the form of land, property, jewelry and other commodities. Money offers another alternative and the biggest advantage of money, as a store of wealth, is its liquidity - it can be reconverted into goods and services instantly.</p>
<p>Thirdly money is used as a standard for deferred payment. Because of its stable value in purchasing power. Producers or firms are prepared to offer their goods and services on credit. This again, facilitates and increases trade.</p>
<p>Lastly, money is used as a unit of measurement and a unit of account. The former means that money is able to price or give the exchange value of things accurately. Because it has many denominations, goods and services can be priced to the last cent. Barter was not able to this and divisibility was a problem. As a unit of account, money allows us to take stock of our wealth conveniently. A man's or a country's wealth is quoted in one number and not by the long list of things processed.</p>

It is not possible io charge the consumer and the use of one person does not reduce the amount to another. For these reasons the private sector will not produce such goods. </p>
<p>Public goods are street lights, roads and flood control. The government will produce these goods because these goods and services are essential. They have benefits (positive externalities) to society. The government pays for such good things through taxation. That means; some people pay for all to benefit. </p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a75bd44bbe0896a7a9ef660cb057d1fe" alt="" width="345" height="149"></p>
<p>The market level of production is zero at O; because MR is zero. The social optimum level is at q<sub>s</sub>; which the government provides. This will be a nationalized industry. The government corrects the market by intervening in resource allocation. The society benefits. However, government run enterprises may be wasteful. This is due to the non-profit nature of a nationalized industry, There may be over production (beyond social optimum level) and there may be productive inefficiency.</p>
<p>Government intervention is also needed to provide merit goods. These are products that the market can produce but not at the socially optimum level. There is excludability and exhaustibility; but there are also positive externalities. The market fails to account for positive externality. Such products like zoos and museums will not be produced because they do not make profits. Education and medical services do make profits, but provision is only for those who can pay. </p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/0a766e5c48217fc2be28aa9f4563c0c6" alt="" width="341" height="320"></p>
<p>In the case of loss making goods (zoos, museums, libraries); the government provides by using taxed money. Private organizations can be given a government grant or subsidy to keep them open. </p>
<p>In the case of schools and hospitals; most of them can be nationalized. However to get the benefits of private management and enterprise, the government can aid private organizations. Lower class beds in hospitals can be subsidized; and students can be given bursaries in private schools. </p>
<p>Where the market does not provide adequately, the government steps in to bring production and consumption to the ideal level. But some aspects of government production can be privatized. A government school can be given to a private agency. The maintenance of roads, bus stops and street lighting can be tendered out. Some clinics in a government hospital can be sold off. </p>
<p>In this way, the best of both worlds; government and private can be obtained.<br>(Students may discuss the provision of public goods and merit goods. This is because the market does not adequately provide these goods.)</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 337</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7668</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain the differences in the features of a market economy and a planned economy.

A man, a company or a family is allowed to own houses, land, cars, shares and livestock. They can transfer ownership to any other party they wish. In a command economy, all resources and finished goods are owned by the government or state. This is called collective ownership. Theoretically, all property is returned to a state when a person dies.</p>
<p>There is no inheritance in such an economy.</p>
<p>Secondly the allocation of resources is determined by a very unique system called the price mechanism in a market economy. The forces of demand, representing consumers and supply, representing producers determine the value or prices of goods. The price mechanism is the channel by which consumers signal to producers on the goods and their respective quantity they want. It also answers the question on how to produce and for whom to produce. The latter is called the distribution function. In this system, the highest bidder secures the good. However, in the command economy, all the above decisions are made on the basis of central-planning. The government though surveys, careful studies and investigations, decides on the 4 basic economic questions. Its aim is to maximise society's welfare.</p>
<p>In a market economy there is freedom of enterprise. People are allowed to organize themselves into business units where they organize factors of production. The objective is only to maximise profits for the entrepreneur. However, again in a command economy, there is no such freedom. Only the government produces and allocates goods to consumers. As its objective is to maximise society's welfare, the government will distribute goods as equally as possible. Its ideal is to have a classless society. In the market economy, the disparity between income groups can be quite large.</p>

<p>The prices of precious metals such as gold, platinum and palladium are determined by supply and demand. This can result in dramatic price changes. Fig. 1 shows their price movements, as index numbers, during 2002.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/0ae636757467bbaca78dffae783e60ff" alt="" width="387" height="490"></p>
<p>Many influences were at work in the markets during this period: Demand for gold as an investment increased as economic conditions became uncertain, interest rates fell&nbsp;and stock markets collapsed. Platinum prices were affected by increasing sales of diesel cars, which must use platinum in their catalytic converters, and the reduction of exports of platinum by Russia. Supplies of precious metals can easily be increased from stocks, but when these are low it is more difficult to expand supply.</p>
<p>Palladium is a substitute for platinum in catalytic converters for cars using petrol (gasoline). Palladium and platinum prices have behaved very differently, as shown in Table 1.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Within a year, 2002, the price of platinum increased by 25%, the price of gold was higher by 24% and the price of palladium was lower by about 50%. These changes are dramatic because they incurred within 12 months.<br>(Index of 100 means 0% change. Any index minus a 100 points gives the negative % change)</li>
<li>Gold is one of the most durable real asset which has value in itself. During uncertain or hard economic conditions; where share prices fall and paper currency depreciates; people switch to gold. Demand rises and supply falls; causing gold price to rise. <br>(Other reasons can be given as the question does not require to come from the article.)</li>
<li><img src="./AL Econ_files/9ef1f869a87c90b54da23c378e7f19d1" alt="" width="397" height="156"><br>Initially the equilibrium price was at P<sub>0</sub> with demand D<sub>0</sub> and supply S<sub>0</sub>. The price rose, possibly due to increase in demand D<sub>1</sub> and a fall in supply to S<sub>1</sub>. Russia cut its exports, As given the demand for car catalytic converters increased. Thus the new price rose to P<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br>(A simple demand-supply diagram is sufficient, and not a market structure diagram.)</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of supply due to a change in price, ceteris paribus. Its formula for a linear supply curve is: PES = (%△quantity supplied of X ) / (%△in price of X)</li>
<li>The PES depends on the availability of stocks. Minerals and metals are durables and can be stored. In the short-term, the PES will be elastic if there are abundant stocks. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/acc2ff6cf6b3fa596f3468ef36b05ae7" alt="" width="407" height="167"><br>However, in the short run the supply can also be inelastic if the stocks are low. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/daac953f57a869f060e7eb104b3b3ae2" alt="" width="414" height="164"><br>(The answer must be based on the article.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Both metals are substitutes for car catalytic converters; but palladium can only be used in petrol-engine cars, not diesels. Also palladium uses are limited; whereas platinum can be used in jewelry. <br>Car producers may have decided to switch from palladium to platinum as it can be used for all car engines. Demand for palladium falls. The price falls drastically because of the inelastic supply. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/76c52cc9b58721aff2322a5eeaaaa8e6" alt="" width="392" height="154"><br>The increase in demand for platinum and the cut by Russia caused the price to rise. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/f1ff2c10d779b879ab4b4a8ad931c801" alt="" width="394" height="157"></li>
<li>It will be a windfall for the country. The country's income will rise. Through government taxation and expenditure, the living standards of the people can be improved - better housing; education, medical facilities and public amenities. The money can also be used for new infrastructure and new investments. <br>The increased exports earnings will improve the current account of the balance of payments. If South Africa has an external debt; this too can ,be settled or reduced. <br>Using the Theory of Income Determination, the export earnings are an injection into the South African economy. It will trigger off the multiplier process: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/70d5aa1ccd325e7340056ce5bb23b3fb" alt="" width="393" height="177"><br>Demand creates supply. Exports cause AD to rise from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>; this causes a more than proportionate increase in national income (Y<sub>0</sub> to Y<sub>1</sub>) and more employment. <br>Indeed if the export earnings are too large; the money can be used for foreign investments. These will generate future income for the country. <br>In conclusion, the rise in world price of gold and platinum will accelerate South Africa's economic growth. It all depends on the government's management of the windfall.</li>

For one, the latter needs the former as a market for their new export industries. If developed countries resort to protectionism or if they organized themselves into trading blocks, it would seriously undermine the growth plans of developing countries. Case in point would be the European Union (EU) and North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA). Developed countries may do this to protect domestic industries, save jobs, correct a balance of payment deficit or to slow down the decline of traditional industries. One can appreciate the fact that it is developed countries who have the purchasing power. Many poor developing countries in the past - South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore became rich because they were able to export, with privileges, into the US market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed countries may also affect developing countries adversely, if they decide to invest internally. This would impede the growth rates of developing countries. An example would be Germany's intention to invest in the former East Germany. This rerouted investments meant for third world countries back to Germany. Foreign direct investment (FDI) bring in capital funds that developing countries lack. The technology, the managerial know-how, the jobs, the training, the ready world markets, the rise of supporting local industries and, of course, more income for poor country. A case in point would be Singapore and Malaysia, who have grown rapidly due to FDI.</p>
<p>Not all developing countries have been successfully. Those who have had failures in development plans have grown into debt. Development projects have completely failed or have outgrown their planned budget. Thus these countries need to borrow more money from rich nations or need more time to repay loans. In the past developed countries have been generous with aid loans and extending credit terms. However they may no longer. Therefore developing countries may have a serious problem in completing projects or clearing their debts. <br>What adds to this problem is that the currencies of the rich countries keep on appreciating - the US$, the £ and the Yen. Over the years the currencies of poor countries have been depreciating. Some, like the Rupiah of Indonesia and Pesos of Argentina, even collapsed. This enlarged the foreign debt, wiped out savings and negates incomes earned in decades.</p>
<p><br>Today, the world economy is very closely interdependent. What goes on in Europe or America affects most of the third world countries. When the US government or major European economies announces a contractionary fiscal policy for the following year, it affects developing countries, because it means a weaker demand for the latter's exports, falling investments and aid. <br>Lastly, the practice of dumping by developed countries affects developing countries. The rich countries often face the problem of over production. These products are sold at very low prices or even below cost into third world countries. The effect is that it destroys the weak local industries that produce the same goods. Income and jobs are lost.</p>
<p>These are some of the ways the policies of developed countries affect developing countries.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 340</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7656</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what indicators suggest that an economy is developing rather than developed.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>All countries can be classified into developed or developing. In the latter group we have under-developed, undeveloped and newly-industrialised economy. It is a big category.</p>
<p>Developing countries have a GNP per head which is much lower: some putting it less than one third the US level. Secondly, their GNP is smaller than their GDP; because they have a lot of foreign investments in their country. Net property income from abroad is a negative.</p>
<p>The economic structure of developing countries is that it has a large primary production base, followed by secondary industries, and a much smaller tertiary sector. Some countries have embarked on low-value-labour intensive manufacturing. Some have also gone into the tertiary sector of tourism. However primary production - fanning and mining are still the foundations of many low-income developing countries.</p>
<p>Developing countries are associated with high population growth rates. Two examples are South Africa and India. Each family will have as many children as possible so that there will be more hands on the farm. In these countries, production is still very labour intensive.</p>
<p>Next, a high mortality and infant mortality rate. Due to the lack of medical facilities, there is a high infant mortality rate. Hence, families have more babies to secure a certain number of children who are able to survive. The lifespan of each individual is very short too, due to poor health facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, the agricultural area. Developing countries produce more primary products. The agricultural products include coffee seeds, tea leaves and rice, just to name a few. Many different kinds of agricultural products are produced for local consumption.</p>
<p>Then, its medical facilities. As mentioned earlier, medical facilities are very poor in developing countries. Diseases like cholera are common in developing countries. With little medical help, mortality rate is high in these countries.</p>
<p>Then, its underemployment. Due to a high population growth rate, the developing countries are densely populated. Everyone is absorbed into the farms as people share the work to be done, underemployment occurs.</p>
<p>Then, its low education level. Low literary rate is a major characteristic of developing countries. The government's provision of this merit good is at a low level. Moreover, poor families cannot afford the cost of education and the opportunity cost of sending their children to school is high because there will be fewer helping hands in the farm.</p>
<p>Then, there are poor sanitation facilities in these countries. The poor facilities will lead to an unhygienic environment. The standard of living is so poor that the people's health is affected.</p>
<p>Lastly, it's housing. Families are poorly sheltered because the standard of housing in developing countries is low. Families live in poorly structured houses built by themselves.</p>
<p>The above is a description of the poorer among the developing countries. Since the eighties, a number of developing countries have successfully moved into manufacturing industries. Their living standards have risen and much improvements have been made in housing, medical services and education. These countries are now called middle-income developing countries. The major part of their economy is now in manufacturing low-value labour intensive goods. These countries have also managed to expand into tertiary industries; namely tourism.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 341</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：7653</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>'The rise in interest rates might not have the desired effect of curbing the existing inflation' reported a newspaper in 2002.</p>

<li>AD is made up or C + I + G + X - M.&nbsp;<br><br>C refers to household consumption, I&nbsp;to investment, G to government spending and X to exports and M to imports.<br><br>A large rise in interest rates will affect consumption (C), investment (I) government spending (G) and imports (M) directly; and exports (X) indirectly. <br>Firstly a rise in interest rates cause investments to fall. Interest is the cost ofusing money. Firms usually borrow money to finance their respective investments. Even if they use their own money, the interest foregone is cost. So long as the return on an investment is greater than the interest incurred, the investment is profitable. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/a199d25cb830a96b71269dcda369e631" alt="" width="575" height="192"><br><br>Investment decreases from I<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to I<sub>1</sub>; when interest rate rises from r<sub>2</sub> to r<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br>An important determinant of investment is the expected net rate of return on additional capacity. This can be estimated by subtracting the estimated operating costs over the life of the asset from the expected revenue through additional assets. However, since cash today can be invested and so can interest, it is worth more than cash in the future. Because of this the future stream of net returns expected from the asset must be discounted from a present value (PV) equivalent, which can then be compared with the current cost of the asset. The most obvious discount rate to use for this purpose is the current rate of interest, since this represents the return foregone if cash is used to purchase fixed assets instead of being loaned. If the present value of this future stream of net returns is greater than the current cost of the asset (its supply price), then additional investment will be profitable. Put another way, net present value (NPV) = PV - supply price; if NPV is positive, then additional investment will be profitable. &nbsp;<br><br>PV = $5000 / (1.1) + $5000 / (1.1)<sup>2</sup> + $5000 / (1.1)<sup>3</sup> +&nbsp;$5000 / (1.1)<sup>4</sup> + $5000 / (1.1)<sup>5</sup> = $13204 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>Thus, purchasing the machine is expected to yield a profit of approximately $13204 at current prices. Subtracting the current cost of the machine i.e. <br>$10 000 still yields a positive net return cf $3204. In other words, the Net Present Value (NPV) =&nbsp;PV&nbsp;- supply price = +$3294. Since NPV is positive, additional investment will be profitable. <br><br>Based on the above example, if the interest rates now rise to 20%, then PV will fall. This may make the investment unprofitable because PV is less than the cost of the capital machinery bought. However, if the interest rate falls to 5%; then PV will rise; making the purchase of more capital equipment profitable. <br>Note that the above discussion is on the basic assumption of all other factors remain constant. In reality, many other factors also affect investments - political stability government fiscal policy, cost of new capital; and so forth. If these change as interest changes, then the above relationship may not hold. <br><br>When interest rates rise, consumption decreases autonomously from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>0</sub>. Here people find it better not to consume because the reward for not spending (saving) is now not lower. Indeed they even stop to borrow to supplement their current income. Those without money prefer not to borrow to consume as the cost of borrowing is now high. Here we have to assume that all other factors remain constant. These are expectations, income tax, GST and inflation.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/201b7c65a31b2154a58af6be735bc017" alt="" width="409" height="185"><br><br>A rise in interest rate causes government spending to fall. Government usually finances its expenditure from traditional sources such as taxes and through the sale of public utilities. However, when government plan for a budget deficit; they have to borrow. Government borrows locally as well as from foreign sources. It borrows from private bank and from the sale of bonds. When market interest rates are high, bond interest are also high. This causes the government to borrow less. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/5d2ea982fe1d4f9d88783ea6c44dd9cf" alt="" width="397" height="170"><br><br>When interest rates are high government spending falls from G<sub>1</sub> to G<sub>0</sub> for any level of income.<br><br>An import (M) is expenditure by local people on foreign goods and services. Import is part of consumption and therefore directly link to income. The higher the income; the higher the consumption and therefore the higher the imports. Therefore imports are income induced. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/93f6bf8d14b752af7d53a6861725bf51" alt="" width="402" height="178"><br><br>However a rise in interest rates will cause an autonomous decrease from M<sub>0</sub> to M<sub>1</sub> Th is is because of the autonomous decrease in consumption, discussed earlier. The decrease in investments may also cause imports to fall as firms do not buy foreign machinery and resources. <br><br>Finally the rise in interest rates may cause exports to decrease by way of an appreciated currency. Assuming a flexible exchange rate system and free capital mobility, the higher interest rate will see an inflow ot funds. This causes domestic currency to appreciate, which in&nbsp;turn makes exports costly to foreigners. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/11a679253017ee164edf63c89699d985" alt="" width="490" height="215"><br><br>Exports fall from x<sub>0</sub> to x<sub>1</sub> due to a rise in the currency caused by the higher interest rate. In conclusion a large rise in interest rates causes AD to fall.</li>
<li>There are a range of policies to deal with inflation. Government policies can successfully bring the rate of inflation down through contractionary policies such as fiscal or monetary policies as well as direct controls, such as wage and price controls. <br><br>A contractionary monetary policy (MP) has the effect of reducing AD. When money supply is reduced, interest rates rise and this reduces the amount of credit in the economy, as borrowing becomes more expensive. <br><br>However in the short term, this contractionary MP policy can actually worsen inflation for 2 reasons. Firstly consumer spending and investment spending are 'sticky'. People keep to their lifestyle and keep all their purchases. They seek ways to pay the higher interest rate. They may raise their own prices (for the self-employed) or demand for higher wages. These actions cause inflation. Finns, too, will raise prices of their finished products rather than cut investment spending. <br><br>In the short term, higher interest can cause demand for credit to rise. This is because producers and consumers see the rise as a trend. They borrow more in the current time to avoid higher interest rates in the near future. Therefore MP faiIs to tame inflation. <br>In the longer term, the effects of a contractionary MP may have its desired effects. Refer to the diagram:<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d18d94aadf1d84dc623be10958d5cdaf" alt="" width="388" height="198"><br><br>When the money supply falls from MS<sub>0</sub> to MS<sub>1</sub>, the interest rate rises from r<sub>0</sub> to r<sub>1.</sub> This makes money costly to use. Consumers save because the opportunity cost of spending is high. Those on credit will now borrow less for the same reasons. Thus demand falls or its increase slows down. <br><br>The higher interest rates also attract domestic savings and foreign capital or "hot money". This may cause an appreciation in the country's currency, which in tum reduces its export competitiveness. <br><br>The decrease in demand for local goods by foreign countries has a deflationary effect on the economy. <br><br>Another factor that can cause the inflation rate to fall is a sharp increase in output, which causes supply to increase faster than demand increases. A rapid rise in the level of output can be achieved by technological advances, increased efficiency and productivity. <br><br>The cure to an inflationary situation really depends on the cause or causes of inflation. The government has to carefully diagnose the problem before formulating the remedies.</li>

<li>Market failure arises when an economic activity of production and consumption is not at the socially optimum level the level that is best for people.<br><br>Market failure can occur because of negative externalities. These are costs that fall on society in general due to activities of certain producers and consumers. They are also called spillover effects or third party effects which are bad. These cost cannot be quantified; that is measured in dollars. External cost (negative externalities) and private cost make up social cost (SC = PC + EC).<br><br>Traffic congestion is caused by private car driving. It occurs when people use the limited road space more than they should. What is the cause of this? It is consumption behavior and the existence of external cost or negative externality arising from car driving. <br><br>A rational individual will consume up to a point where the total utility he derives is maximized for every additional dollar he spends on the good. In economics, nothing is free; there must be a price for everything. Price is an indicator of value and opportunity cost. The higher the price, the higher the value society attaches to the good, and also the scarcer the good. <br><br>A rational individual will consume up to a point where the total utility he derives is maximized for every additional dollar he spends on the good. In economics, nothing is free; there must be a price for everything. Price is an indicator of value and opportunity cost. The higher the price, the higher the value society attaches to the good, and also the scarcer the good (Once the MU is&nbsp;zero.) <br><br>Urban traffic congestion is the result of inefficient allocation of resources by car buyers and sellers. The price signal sent to the market is not effective enough to reflect how many cars should be allowed to run on the roads in the country, to the extent that it leads to road congestion. What then are the imperfections in the car market that lead to road congestion? <br><br>The bulk of cost of car ownership and driving are fixed costs - depreciation, the road tax and insurance. Usage cost is only petrol which is low. Thus every additional trip is close to zero cost. In fact the higher fixed cost encourages more usage of road space as these are already paid for. However, in using the road space, the consumer does not consider the non-monetary cost of congestion; other consumers and producers are not able to travel efficiently. Time is wasted. National production levels fall. People's welfare suffer due to the strain of being in a traffic jam. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/679fd7be3d74c0a89f5830b87415cb9e" alt="" width="326" height="186"><br><br>Car driving is at Oq<sub>1</sub> because the consumer maximizes his utility where PMC = PMB. However society wants car driving to be at Oq<sub>2</sub>, where SMC= PMB. The shaded areas shows welfare loss to society. Therefore traffic congestion is market failure. <br><br>It should be pointed out that the above discussion is the context of a pure market, free enterprise economy where the government does not get involved in resource allocation. Therefore private consumers and producers make decisions only on the basis for their own private costs and benefits. They are not compelled to consider negative or positive externalities. In fact very often, they fail to even recognize that externalities exist.<br><br></li>
<li>When the firm's activity causes negative externalities, free markets will lead to a situation where marginal benefits are less than social costs. The market mechanism thereby tends to encourage inefficiency. Large outputs of such products will be produced. Therefore government is needed to correct the situation. <br><br>The opposite is true of products that have positive externalities. Private industry will provide inefficiently small quantities of these products. Society would be better off with larger output levels. Hence, the existence of externalities leads to failure of the market system to allocate resources efficiently. Again, government intervention is needed.<br><br>Therefore, when there are externalities associated with the production of goods or services, there will tend to be an over-supply or under-supply of the products in question (depending on whether these are negative or positive externalities). In such cases, the government can undertake measures to bring the supply closer to the optimal or socially efficient level. There are several forms of market corrections. <br><br>Firstly, the government can impose a tax on each unit of output; the amount of the tax corresponding to a External Marginal Cost (EMC). Similarly, appropriate subsidies could be given to generators of positive externality. In either case, the intention would be to account for external costs and benefits so as to prevent allocative efficiency. <br><br>For Negative externality, the SMC&gt; PMC as indicated by the figure: <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/feb68d6e4feaee91c70491d16ecfcb8b" alt="" width="329" height="213"><br><br>For a demerit good, a tax charged on each unit of production has the same effect as an increase in the costs of production and hence would shift the producer's marginal cost upwards i.e. the PMC curve increases. If this tax accurately reflects the external marginal costs of the firm is now in effect having to pay for the use of the environment and is this now taken account of by profit maximizing firms. As can be seen from the diagram, the imposition of the tax moves the equilibrium from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1</sub> which is the socially efficient level (where SMC = SMB). <br><br>For a merit good, the government should give a subsidy equal to the external marginal benefit (EMB) and thereby shifting the private marginal benefit curve (PMB) upwards to coincide with the social marginal cost (SMC),&nbsp;increasing the production of the good from q<sub>0</sub> (which is under produced) to the socially efficient level q<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/3d837f8d695953c6deb645e0dfe0b269" alt="" width="305" height="229"><br><br>Secondly, the government can use regulation or legislation to improve Minimum Standards. <br><br>Where a demerit good exists, firms could be prohibited by law from producing a level that is more than the socially efficient output. This involves methods that stipulate environmental standards or minimum desirable quantities. It could take the form of either imposing legal ceilings on the amount any polluter is permitted to emit or specification of how particular activities must be carried out. <br><br>A third method is nationalisation. It could be argued that firms with associated externalities could be taken into public ownership and their output controlled to take account of costs and benefits. Some, however, would argue that this would instead lead to cost inefficiency. <br><br>A forth solution is bargaining solution. Demerit goods that give rise to pollution and congestion could be internalized through bargaining. Consider the external cost of pollution, the sufferers can negotiate with the producers to decrease the levels of pollution or alternatively the producer can offer compensation depending on who has greater rights to the environment. No matter what the legal position regarding who must compensate whom, the output after bargaining will be closer to the socially efficient level. These bargaining solutions are usually relevant to small groups only. Where the parties involved are numerous or difficult to identify, the transaction and administration costs of such bargaining procedures are likely to outweigh the benefits. <br><br>Lastly, the government can place a total ban on the product.&nbsp;<br><br>The figure below compares the welfare loss caused by the externalities of producing a product with the welfare loss brought about by banning the product. lf the free market profit maximizing output (q<sub>0</sub>) is compared with the socially efficient output (q<sub>0</sub>) it can be seen that there is an associated welfare loss equal to the area of the shaded triangle A. Conversely if a zero output is compared with the socially efficient output, then the welfare loss would be equal to the area shaded triangle B. This indicates that banning the polluting product might involve a greater welfare loss than not attempting to control pollution at all. Banning the product, may, however be justifiable if area B is smaller than area A i.e. the welfare loss in not producing is less than that when production is allowed as shown in the same diagram.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/c586a198cc8cd334b0c5bb81784b8bb9" alt="" width="279" height="166"><br><br>The above examples are highly theoretical. In real life, the fact that externalities cannot be accounted for in monetary terms, planners are not able to pinpoint the social optimal level of output. Therefore, it may not be possible to achieve an optimal allocation of resources when it comes to merit and demerit goods.</li>

<p>Discuss whether the economic theory of wages can explain how workers in a vital industry such as the fire-fighting service can have lower pay than workers in a less vital industry such as entertainment.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>The economic theory of wages is the marginal revenue productivity theory. It assumes perfect competition in a particular labour market. Labour is like any other commodity bought and sold in a market. The free market forces of demand and supply determines its price or wage rate.</p>
<p>A perfect competition market assumes the existence of many buyers (employers) and sellers (each worker sells his services individually). Thus no one has a control over the market wage rate. All players become wage takers. Secondly labour is homogenous, meaning each worker has the same qualifications and skills as the other. Thirdly, there is perfect knowledge where all employers and labour know the prevailing market rate. Next, there is freedom of entry and exit of labour from the labour market. No trade union or government regulations to block entry of workers. Lastly, there is labour mobility. It is easy for labour to acquire new skills to enter a particular labour market.</p>
<p>The market industry demand for labour (also called MRP) is downward sloping:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/8051a55d7857018d7eea0f3df6a362d3" alt="" width="354" height="145"></p>
<p>This is because of the theory's assumption of short run. Labour, being the variable factor is subject to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns (LDMR). Ceteris paribus; additional labour contribute a smaller amount to output, therefore deserving only a small wage. However, the demand or MRP of labour can shift to the right if its productivity rises (MPP) or the demand for the finished goods rises (MR). MRP = MPP x MR (price).</p>
<p>As the demand for the finished good rises it causes price (MR) to rise. The demand for labour is a derived demand; like wood and furniture. The demand for the former depends on the demand for the latter. When the demand for furniture rises, the demand for carpenters will also rise, because firms want to produce more. Other factors that cause a shift in demand for labour are the availability of capital substitutes and the proportion that wage costs make up in total costs. New capital makes current labour redundant. Only labour that can use the new technology will be demanded.</p>
<p>The market supply of labour in the industry is upward sloping:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/58e2ddc32d1a0073b3ccc50b3dcea786" alt="" width="355" height="150"></p>
<p>This is because labour wants to maximize its welfare and benefit. As the wage rate rises the O.C (opportunity cost) of staying in another job or not working at all, is higher. The supply can shift depending on the size of population, labour force, preference of workers and educational opportunities. It also depends on government policy on legal working and retirement ages, and on foreign workers.</p>
<p>Workers preference is influenced by pleasure, safety, long term prospects, convenience and social status of a job. The interaction of demand and supply forces in the market gives the wage rate:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/36ee2876faf92b24bbb9a47357a17700" alt="" width="371" height="159"></p>
<p>Assuming a constant demand and supply, the equilibrium is at W<sub>e</sub> where demand equals supply. If wage rate were at W<sub>1</sub>, there will be a surplus; which will force the rate to fall.</p>
<p>If the rate were at W<sub>2</sub>; there will be a shortage, which forces wage to rise. This is how wages are determined in economic theory.</p>
<p>Referring to the question, the theory fits in quite well for firefighters. Such a labour market has the features of perfect competition with the characteristics of many buyers and sellers, homogeneous labour, and freedom of entry. In many developed countries, it is no longer just the government who provide fire services; but numerous private fire service firms have sprung up due to the liberalization of the industry. The market demand for such labourers would be low because of its low productivity. It also would be elastic due to the availability of capital substitutes. The supply would be abundant and elastic due to the low entry requirement, short training period and low costs.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/a76fd2a2ed75b16b9356cce43944b1b5" alt="" width="340" height="146"></p>
<p>The wage rate of fire fighters is low because of the abundant supply relative to its demand.</p>
<p>Assuming, there is a fall in supply of labour in this industry because of better wages in other industries. This fits into the perfect competition theory. If demand (MRP) is constant, the wage rate should rise a little. But this is unlikely because one can expect demand to fall as well. This is due to the substitution of capital for labour.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/0d569725fbdd36d9c3b133563a2e50d5" alt="" width="327" height="142"></p>
<p>The wage rate of firefighters remains low because demand falls as much as the fall in supply.</p>
<p>In the case of professional singers, the economic theory fits in very poorly. None of the assumption of&nbsp;perfect competition are met. There is no situation of many buyers, because there are only a few agencies. The entertainment and recording industry is an oligopoly; where a few large reputed firms dominate the industry. There are not many sellers (professional singers) themselves. Secondly, professional singers are never homogeneous, making it impossible to put up a market demand and supply. Each singer has his own supply and demand. Then professional singers may keep their salaries secret. There is no factor mobility; at least not in the shortterm. It takes years to train professional singers. The entry requirement is high. Training is long and costly. In fact, to be a good singer needs a lot of inherent qualities that the person is simply gifted with. Professional singers earn a high wage because their demand is high relative to the supply.</p>
<p>The former is high and inelastic because of their high productivjly, and for the fact that capital can never replace singers. The demand is high because the demand for entertainment is a growing demand. The supply is short because of the high entry requirement, the high cost, the long period of training and also because to be professional singers requires some in-born qualities. As demand rises faster than supply for the stated reasons, the long term trend is for wages of professional singers to rise.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/e789f94cce6b918e156662753b787583" alt="" width="337" height="174"></p>

Differences in these factors cause a market to fall into, either a perfect or imperfect market. Imperfect markets can again be classified into competitive and non-competitive types.</p>
<p>The first distinguishing factor between a perfect competitive market and an oligopoly is in the number of buyers and sellers. In a perfect competitive market, there is a large number of both; leading to complete diffusion of economic power. No one buyer or seller can determine market price or supply. As a result everyone is a price taker. Market concentration is low and there will be a common price. In an oligopoly market, there are a few or a few dominant sellers. Market concentration of the three largest or five largest firms is high. These firms will be able to dictate market supply and price.</p>
<p>The second distinguishing factor is that in a perfect competition market, the products of different sellers is perfectly homogenous. Therefore it does not matter from which seller a consumer buys from. Products are perfect substitutes. Cross elasticity of demand (XED) is very elastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of oligopoly market, goods of different firms can be homogenous or slightly differentiated. Usually they are differentiated because of the extensive advertising and other promotional activities of the large firms. In Singapore oligopolies would be sport shoes, bread, petrol stations and taxi companies. Each has differentiated products, real and imaginary, but they are close substitutes.</p>
<p>Due to differences in these factors, the demand curve facing a perfect competition market firm is perfectly elastic. In the case of an oligopoly firm, there is a kinked demand curve, where the demand is elastic above the prevailing market price and inelastic below it. This is because rivals will not match a price increase but will do so for a price fall. Refer to the diagrams below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/481d6304902d04efa9673414d086a28f" alt="" width="280" height="267"></p>
<p>Not all oligopoly markets or firms have a kinked demand curve. Where some large firms enjoy very strong brand loyalty, they will command a steep and inelastic demand curve all the way. Nike for sport shoes, colgate for toothpaste and Nokia for handphones are good examples.</p>
<p>The third main difference is concerning barriers to entry. In perfect competition there are no barriers to entry. When existing firms make supernormal profits, new firms enter the market. This increases market supply that cause prices to fall. In the long run firms can only make normal profits. In the case of an oligopoly, firms can make either normal or supernormal profits in the long run. This is because there are barriers to entry. Barriers to entry prevent new firms from entering and even if they do, they will not survive the competition.</p>
<p>On the issue of competition, there is only price competition in perfect competitive market. The many number of firms in the market structure, makes it impossible for firms to cooperate in price, since some firms will always undercut the others. In an oligopoly market, there is usually the avoidance of price wars because the few firms understand that cooperation will raise their profitability at the expense of consumers. However, firms in oligopoly markets do compete in other forms like advertising and other promotional activities.</p>
<p>Lastly it's only the perfect competition firm that achieves allocative and productive efficiencies. Production is where P = MC and at the lowest AC in the long run. This is due to the characteristics mentioned - numerous sellers, homogenous products and no barriers to entry. Firms in oligopoly markets are allocatively inefficient because price always exceeds MC at the level of output. Secondly, output will not be at the lowest AC. Refer to the diagram below that shows equilibrium in the long run for profit maximizing firms in their respective market structures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c05e3b89afd91f78dc33caebf6bfc48f" alt="" width="302" height="382"></p>
<p>What is similar between perfect competition and oligopoly? Firstly, they both usually have the same objectives - maximizing profits. All firms and entrepreneurs are rational people. Being so, profit is the main objective. However the chances for success are greater in oligopoly because of barriers of entry. Firms in perfect competition face a lot of competition from new entrants. This erodes their profits. Secondly, firms in both market structures engage in price wars. In perfect competition, that is the only form of business survival. It's not possible to collude because there arc just too many sellers. What more, selling the same homogenous product. Oligopoly firms occasionally do engage in price war; especially when collusion breaks down. This may happen when firms have a lot of unsold stock or when one firm is confident of monopolizing the entire market by cutting price.</p>
<p>As we can see the differences are more. Firstly, the demand curve is horizontal for perfect competition firms and downward sloping for oligopoly. It is also inelastic for a price cut. Oligopoly firms may also engage in non-price competition - advertising, branding, free gifts and so forth. There is a deliberate attempt to differentiate products so as to create customer loyalty.</p>
<p>More significantly, firms in oligopoly collude. They may form a cartel, fix prices and give a quota to each member. This is very different from perfect competition where no one can influence the market price; output level or number of firms.</p>
<p>On the issue of efficiencies, there is no allocative (P &gt; MC) and productive efficiency (not at minimum AC) in an oligopoly market. In perfect competition, there is. However, the price of oligopoly firms can be lower, the output greater, the AC and MC lower than any perfect competition firm. This is because large firms can enjoy economies of scale - internal and external. Mass production with a lower AC, lower price and greater-output will still make supernormal profits.</p>
<p><br>Competition in perfect competition is intense, but it is only price undercutting. In oligopoly there may be less of this, but competition may be more intense in other ways - advertising, free gifts, lucky draws or loyalty points. More importantly competition in the form of product development and better after sales service.&nbsp;These are the major differences and similarities between the two market firms.&nbsp;</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 345</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：6353</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain what is meant by the income and substitution effects of a price change and discuss why these might be different for different types of goods.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>A change in price produces two effects: income effect (YE) and substitution effect (SE).</p>
<p>Income effects shows the change in the quantity demanded for a good rising from a change to the consumer's real income, ceteris paribus. <br>Substitution effect shows the change in relative price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>Referring to the diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/100e69fcb3f09c71cdb41878652835ca" alt="" width="334" height="161"></p>
<p>Assume that a consumer is in equilibrium at point E which is the point of tangency between the indifference curve IC<sub>1</sub> and budget line AB. When the price of X falls, the budget line will swing outwards to AC. Substitution effect is measured from E to E<sub>1</sub> when imaginary budget line DF is constructed parallel to AC which is tangent to the original indifference curve IC<sub>1</sub> at point E. By comparing the budget line AB and DF, the consumer now finds the good X relatively cheaper and good Y relatively more expensive. To maximize his satisfaction, the consumer purchases X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub> more of good X in order to substitute good Y. Hence SE (substitution effect) leads to an increase in quantity demanded of good X&nbsp;by X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Income effect is measured from E<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;to E<sub>2</sub>, in which the parallel shift of budget line from DF to AC depicts an increase in real income while money income remains unchanged. Hence income effect alone leads to an increase in quantity demanded of good X by X<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>. This means that the income effect of good X is positive i.e. consumer purchase more of good X when his real income increases. By the discussion above, good X is said to be a normal good.</p>
<p>Substitution effect is always negative regardless of the type of goods. Income effect is positive for normal goods but negative for inferior and giffen goods.</p>
<p>The table below sums the SE and YE for the 3 types of goods:</p>

</table>
<p>Key: → means buy more;← means buy less. This is for a fall in price; all other factors stay constant.</p>
<p>For a normal good (NG), the SE is always negative (buy more price falls) and is supported by the YE (buy more real income rises). Overall the consumers buy more. This is because preference is for this good.</p>
<p>For an inferior good (Inf G), the SE effect is also negative but it is partially offsetted by YE which is negative (buy less real income rises). Thus there is really no preference for this good.</p>
<p>People switch to other goods that they like more and can now afford.</p>
<p>In the case of the Giffen good (inferior goods), the SE which is also negative (buy more price falls) is over powered by the YE which says buy a lot less. This is a negative relationship (buy less when real income has increased). This good was, actually, the consumer's last choice.<br><br></p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 346</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：6351</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>The following is adapted from an article which ·appeared in a newspaper in August 2002.</p>
<p><strong>Lower earnings in the US could endanger economic recovery.</strong> <br>Although the recession has ended, the wage rates of more than 100 million workers in the US below management level have remained unchanged for over a year, and this is endangering consumer spending. The effect on spending is particularly noticeable because there has been a Joss of overtime hours, which has decreased earnings. In addition, 1.7 million jobs have been lost in the past year and the unemployment rate is now 5.9%.</p>
<p>Employers faced with falling profits have cut their costs. They have stopped paying for health insurance for their employees. These charges are now deducted from their employees' earnings, which further reduces consumer spending. Some workers have tried to resist downward pressure on their earnings 2700 workers in a food company were on strike for six weeks. At the end of the strike the company did agree to pay for the health insurance rather than pass the cost onto the workers. However, in a weak economy with unemployment rising, the bargaining power of other wage earners has diminished.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone fears that consumer spending is likely to fall. According to the US Government's Commerce Department, a broader measure of personal income, which includes items such as social security benefits and unemployment benefits as well as wages, has shown an increase. Some argue that this increase is enough to generate a recovery in the economy. But if a broader picture is to be taken then any income earned from the stock market should also be included, as this is a huge source of income in the economy. Since the late 1990s this source has shrunk considerably.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, uncertain whether all these changes balance each other out or whether there will be a sufficient increase in consumer spending to generate a recovery. It also partly depends on how the workers view the changes in their earnings and how long they think the current situation will last.</p>

<li>Firstly, the lost of overtime pay. Secondly, 1.7 million jobs were lost, which means that incomes of these workers fell. Thirdly, many firms transferred health insurance payments to their employees. In all, disposable income fell. <br><br></li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>To maintain profit levels and margins. Health insurance is part of the firm's cost of production. Profit is the difference between revenue (sales) and cost. Since sales were bad (due to recession) and profits were falling, the firms cut cost by not paying their workers health insurance.</li>
<li>The food company probably had calculated to realise that the cost of the strike (6 weeks already) was more than the cost of health insurance. The financial costs of the strike would be the output foregone; the loss in sales revenue, and the depreciation of capital equipment. The non-financial loss is the damage to investors confidence; cancelled orders and general reputation with clients. The firm was minimizing loss, in agreeing to pay for workers' health insurance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are 2 sets of reasons for the disagreement about the likely changes in consumer spending. <br><br>Firstly, the issue of disposable income. Has it risen or fallen? The answer depends on how one calculates disposable income. If we consider that 1.7m jobs were lost, overtime was cut and workers were made to pay for the insurance from their own salaries, then disposable income would fall. Therefore, consumer spending would also fall. <br><br>Secondly, the current economic situation or what consumers think is the situation or expect it to be in the near future. Officially the recession has ended, but incomes have not grown. Confidence and expectation are difficult to measure and difficult to interpret. However, consumer spending is influenced by them. Thus the disagreement about the likely changes in consumer spending. <br><br></li>
<li>The analysis is based on the Keynesian concept of 'demand creates supply'. When there is no demand, there will be no supply. The country will be in a recession or a deflationary gap. <br><br>When incomes are low or falling, the level of spending will also be low. This means that prices will be falling or at least stagnant. There is no reason for firms to increase production. Instead they may even cut production to ensure that prices do not fall. Workers are laid off and overtime is cut; causing a fall in income; which causes a fall in consumption demand; which causes a fall in prices; which gives reason to cut production again. This is the vicious cycle of a recession. <br><br><img src="./AL Econ_files/7d300c97dcd04228fbef0648d43caade" alt="" width="267" height="140"><br><br>AD falls because consumption falls. This causes income to fall from Y<sub>0</sub> to Y<sub>1</sub>.<br><br>It is important to note that what is more significant is how AD and consumption is affected by expectations. News of firms closing down; retrenchments and bankruptcies make people believe that times are really bad. They expect the situation to worsen. Thus they spend even lesser. An economic recovery (getting out of a recession) needs stronger spending and good expectations. Lower earnings and the expectation of lower earnings endanger recovery.</li>

Therefore when a country's currency depreciates against other currency, its exports become cheaper. The country can expect an export-led boost leading to more income and employment.</p>
<p>Take the case of a country, South Africa. When the South African rand falls, the country's export price in US$ falls as well. For example, if item A cost R$200 in South Africa, it will cost US$50 in the world if the exchange rate where R$4 = US$ 1. However, when the Rand falls to R$5 = US$ 1, the same item in the world will cost US$40.</p>
<p>With an elastic demand curve for African exports, the South African economy will sell more quantities overseas and earn more at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/f5342914f1328984e45286251ee2d7f9" alt="" width="356" height="162"></p>
<p>The quantity increases from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>. The total revenue also increases as shown.</p>
<p>Assuming import expenditure remains constant, the balance of payments on current account will improve. This acts as an injection into the South African circular flow of income. Through the multiplier process, it will create more income and employment.</p>
<p>A quota is a limit on the quantity allowed into a country. When South Africa imposes a quota on imports, the market is affected in this manner:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/cf66f492e7e7f93df8a01aec6640f2e3" alt="" width="342" height="151"></p>
<p>The quota causes supply to shift from S<sub>m</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. The prices rise to P<sub>1</sub> and the quantity falls to Oq<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;The import expenditure is reduced by q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>0</sub>cb; but increase by P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>0</sub>ba. Overall it falls; correcting the trade deficit.</p>
<p>For both devaluation and the quota to work, the country's demand must be elastic. A fall in currency causes the price of imports to rise. The more than proportionate fall in imports demanded causes total import spending to fall. Likewise, the weaker currency makes exports in foreign currency cheaper. The more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded for exports causes total export earnings to rise. In the case of the quota, too, demand for import must be elastic. The diagram shows how a quota can worsen a deficit when demand is inelastic:</p>
<p><img src="./AL Econ_files/c5f9fb45a04c907b39955a1e343b4b48" alt="" width="349" height="160"></p>
<p>The quota Oq<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>causes the price to rise a lot from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>. With the inelastic demand, more is spent (P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>0</sub>bc) than money saved (q<sub>0</sub>q<sub>1</sub>ab). Thus the trade deficit worsens.</p>
<p>There is a second condition required for devaluation to work. The supply of local exports must also be elastic and the supply of imports too, must be elastic. This ensures that local price of exports do not rise (due to the extra demand) because of inelastic supply. It will offset the positive effect of devaluation. Likewise if the foreign supply of import is inelastic; the foreigner will lower price to offset the appreciation of his currency. Ideally, all demands and all supplies must be elastic for a currency fall to have its desired effect.</p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 348</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：6340</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Explain how the determination of a floating exchange rate differs from that of a fixed exchange rate.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>An exchange rate refers to the external value of a country's currency. It refers to the amount or a foreign currency needed to buy one unit of the local currency. For example, it may take US50$ to buy 1 Singapore dollar. <br>Here, we discuss about two exchange rate systems from which a government can choose.<br>The first system is called the fixed exchange rate system. As the name implies, the rate is fixed by the central bank (CB) of the country. This rate, called the official rate is maintained by constant intervention by the CB. <br>Refer to the diagram below: <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/656d029758edbeb47cb0aa213100cd0b" alt="" width="356" height="162"><br>This is the foreign exchange market for Singapore dollars expressed in USS. The official rate is US50¢ to S$ l. Initially the market demand (Dd SS) and market supply (SS S$) intersects at the official rate. <br>There is equilibrium in the market. If the demand for S$ rises from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> (in the diagram below); the government CB will have to increase supply from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>; otherwise the market will not clear. There will be shortage of q<sub>0</sub>q<sub>1.</sub> On the other hand, should the market supply increase, the government will have to buy up its currency in order to support it. This is done by selling away its reserves of other currencies. For this to work, it is necessary that the government maintains a buffer stock of currencies (official reserves). <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/4ca684857a55317a97fa0e844840b709" alt="" width="361" height="183"><br>The second system is the market system. It has been called the floating, free-fluctuating and flexible exchange rate system. The rate is determined by the free market forces of demand and supply, which is allowed to change even on a daily basis. The government does not intervene to maintain a particular rate; although the CB does buy and sell currencies for its own needs. The market clears because the rate is allowed to change. If demand rises, the rate, in turn rises which attracts sellers. In the diagram below, the rate rose from US$0.50 to US$0.70 per S$ when the demand rose from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. The higher rate caused supply to increase from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/b0706eadf4321874f156d5e798fdc4bc" alt="" width="343" height="165"><br>Likewise, when the supply increases in the market, the price is allowed to fall; this induces buying of the currency. In this system, there is no necessity for the government to maintain reserves for stabilization purposes. However, there will be plenty of currency fluctuations. <br><br></p></div></div><!----></div><div class="c-question avoid-break"><span class="p-index">NO. 349</span><span class="p-id layui-hide">题号：6334</span><div class=""><div class="p-content"><p>Discuss the usefulness to businesses of a knowledge of price elasticity of demand and income elasticity of demand.</p></div><div class="p-fold"><a href="javascript:;" class="op-fold">[-收起]</a></div></div><div class="p-action-wrap"><div class="p-meta-info" style="visibility: hidden;"><span>A level ECONOMICS</span><span></span></div><div class="p-action-btns"><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>显示MS </span></button><button type="button" class="h-btn"><!----><span>隐藏解析 </span></button></div></div><!----><div class="p-explain-wrap"><div class="p-explain"><p>Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in its own price. <br>Income elasticity of demand (YED) measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in income. <br>Taking mobile phone as an example, as a promoter of mobile phones, the firm would carry out market research regularly. The data will be used as follows: if the PED is elastic for mobile phones then it means that a small decrease in price of mobile phones will lead to a more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded of mobile phones and vice versa. Therefore, a lower price will increase revenue collected. It will also increase profits due to the larger volume (although a thinner profit margin). <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/21dd52ff8be7ee7caf2bbb4c59fccf05" alt="" width="295" height="145"><br>Before: Total Revenue = A + C <br>After: Total Revenue B + C <br>Area B &gt; Area A <br>If the PED is inelastic, then it means that a small increase in price of mobile phones will lead to a less than proportionate decrease in the quantity demanded of mobile phones and vice versa. Therefore, raising price will increase revenue collected. It will also increase profits due to the thicker profit margin and that the fall m sales volume was proportionately smaller. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/e7ba16fa71c6091aa75cf4712abbd3b5" alt="" width="293" height="151"><br>Before: Total Revenue = A + C <br>After: Total Revenue = B + C <br>Area B &gt; Area A <br>If PED is one, then a price fall will lead to a proportionate increase in the quantity demanded of mobile phones and vice versa.

If YED is negative, such models should be phased out with a sale. As income rises new models with new technological features, must be introduced because the public treats them as normal goods. Only in an economic down tum or, recession, should 'inferior' models of mobile phones be promoted. The two diagrams show the Income Consumption Curves (ICC) for normal and inferior goods. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/1cc6853b0aae0a3c47d355ef4fca5b8d" alt="" width="321" height="317"><br><br>These are some of the uses of PED and YED for a producer of mobile phones. <br>However, one should bear in mind that data on PED and YED&nbsp;are not scientific knowledge. They are not absolute truths. These data are based on survey studies on small samples of consumers. They cannot be completely accurate and, at times even be, false. The data on PED and YED was computed on the basis of all other things or factors remaining constant. Over a period of times, other factors do change and data becomes outdated.

<li>The CPI rose from 100 points to 1404; that is, it rose by 1304%. This is a tremendous increase from 1988 to 2001.<br>(Index to percentage has a difference of 100.)</li>
<li>Take food: the weight is higher in Jamaica (56%) than UK (29%). This is because the former is a lower income developing country where food being a necessity, takes up a larger proportion of income. In UK, a rich country, the proportion is smaller because food has a saturation point, as people get richer. <br>Take housing: In the UK, the weightage is higher because, as in rich countries people upgrade to bigger and better houses that require much more money. Expenditure at most other items would be at saturation point. <br>(Note that weight is based on proportion of income spent and not total amount of money. Also students should choose items where the differences in weightage are larger.)</li>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Transport contributed more to Jamaica in the month of June 2001. Although food's weight is 56, its price increase was only 0. 7%; giving a weighted increase of 0.7 x 56 = 39.2. For transport it was 22.6 x 6 = 135.6.</li>
<li>Unlike all other items; prices for housing fell in this month (-1.3%); therefore having a dampening effect on inflation. However its weight is only 8 points; not even 10% of total weights; and its fall was small. Therefore it could not offset the overall inflationary trend in the country.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Jamaica's inflation was significantly higher for all years. For both countries it was higher for the 1990 -1992 period. The rates also fluctuated for both countries.<br>(Note that positive inflation means that the price rose year on year. Prices were highest in 2000.)</li>
<li>Inflation can be caused by government action and also by government inaction; the government has the responsibility to regulate inflation in the country.&nbsp;Firstly government fiscal policy is to expansionary; running a budget deficit. Too many mega projects put a strain on the country's resources. Production cost rose and therefore prices of finished products also rose. If taxes are not high enough, disposable income is higher, causing spending to be too high as well. <br><img src="./AL Econ_files/d0d33adc05f43e0bae0b3831169c0d6a" alt="" width="326" height="148"><br>AD rises faster than AS, causing prices to rise from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;<br>Secondly, with an expansionary monetary policy, the excessive increase in money supply (easy credit) causes interest rates to fall, from r<sub>1</sub> to r<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;<br><img src="./AL Econ_files/fbe72f914553816452cab635a2c61660" alt="" width="299" height="145"><br>This encourages consumers to borrow and spend on credit. Firms too, borrow to invest. The demand for resources rises too fast, pushing up prices. <br>Thirdly, government failure to support the currency causes inflation so that imports become too costly and the demand for exports rise too fast. This causes prices to go up. A weak currency is inflationary. <br>As mentioned government inaction to control trade unions and failure to check on hoarding by oligopolies and monopolies can also cause inflation.</li>
