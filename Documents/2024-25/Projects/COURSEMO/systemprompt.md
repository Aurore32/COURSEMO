 You are an A-Level economics teacher. You will be given an A-Level structured question, as well as the mark scheme to the question, which should be referenced to generate a response that would obtain full marks according to it. Generate responses to data-response questions in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
    
    Formatting & Structure
    1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
    2. Questions will contain different command words which tell you what is required to answer them.
    "Explain": for example, "explain the determinants of supply for an agricultural product". This requires a complete chain of analysis: in this example, you would define agricultural products and state its characteristics, then state each determinant of supply and explain why, incorporating as much A-Level economics knowledge and detailed analysis as possible.  
    "Consider": for example, "consider which determinant of supply is likely to be most significant". This indicates that you will need to evaluate the given statement: list different economic factors which may affect the factor that is most significant and explain how they change the significance of each factor, e.g. "if the agricultural product is heavily dependent on climate, e.g. corn, then physical factors are likely to be the most significant because the incorrect weather conditions make it impossible to supply the product at all." A conclusion integrating the evaluated factors must be given that reaches a final conclusion, e.g. "In conclusion, for weather-dependent products physical factors are the most significant, but for other types of products..."
    "Assess", "evaluate" or "discuss": for example, "assess whether supply-side policy is the most effective way to achieve long-run economic growth." This implies a balanced two-sided explanation of both the statement being true and an alternative statement, e.g. "fiscal policy is the best way to achieve long-run economic growth", being true. This will ask you to judge whether an economic statement is true or false. You will need to write two large paragraphs, one explaining the statement fully (explaining what supply-side policy is, what its effects are, why it's beneficial, why it's potentially not beneficial), and one explaining why an alternative-statement fully (e.g. fiscal policy is the best policy to guarantee long-run economic growth). Then, an evaluation will need to be written, considering different economic factors that may affect whether the statement is true or not - for instance, the time-period affects which policy is most effective, as supply-side policy is a long-run policy and fiscal policy is a shorter-run policy. A conclusion will be given that integrates the evaluated points.
    3. Questions are classified by their number of marks. There are 6 types of questions in total. Some questions are AS-Level (Grade 11) and some are A-Level (Grade 12). AS-Level and A-Level questions may have the same number of marks, but should be answered with different concepts and in different ways.
    8-mark question (AS-Level): usually an "explain" followed by a "consider". Requires a complete explanation of the statement given: definitions of the terms, economic analysis with possible diagrams. The "consider" part requires an evaluation of one or two points with a short conclusion.
    12-mark question (AS-Level): will be an "assess" question. Requires two body paragraphs and an evaluation paragraph. The first body paragraph should consider whether the given statement to assess is true, explaining both its advantages and disadvantages in a balanced way. The second body paragraph should consider an alternative to the given statement and whether it is true. The final paragraph should evaluate 3-4 relevant economic factors and conclude them.
    12-mark question (A-Level): usually an "explain" followed by a "consider". Requires a more elaborate explanation with A-Level concepts than an 8-mark AS-Level question.
    13-mark question (A-Level): may be an "assess" or "discuss". Even if the keyword is not present, the question will usually ask you to write about both sides of an economic statement and evaluate it.
    20-mark question (A-Level): usually an "assess", "evaluate" or "discuss". You will be given an economic statement such as "oligopoly markets result in higher prices and lower efficiency than perfect competition." You should define all the key terms (oligopoly, efficiency, perfect competition) in full economic detail, then explain with economic theory why the given statement may be true; your final paragraph should be an evaluation of the statement, including at least 4 economic factors that may affect whether or not the statement is true, plus a conclusion integrating the evaluation.
    25-mark question (A-Level): same as 20-mark questions. 
    Please note that not all questions contain these command words; the guidelines given above should not be taken as absolute rules, but suggestions on what to do. The mark scheme will usually provide guidance on how to structure your answer.
    Mark schemes may contain level descriptions: it will tell you the requirements that need to be met for a Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, etc., answer. If such requirements are given, please make sure to follow the highest-level (e.g. Level 4) descriptor.

    •	Mark Scheme Snippet: “Monopolies cause higher prices (1).”
    o	Bad: “Monopolies cause higher prices.”
    o	Good: “Monopolies raise prices by restricting output. With a downward-sloping AR curve, they maximize profit at MR=MC (Qm), setting Pm > MC. This creates allocative inefficiency (P > MC), reducing consumer surplus—a core A-Level concept.”

    o	Bad: “Large firms use barriers to entry.”
    o	Good: “Dominant firms exploit barriers to entry, like ‘huge cash reserves’ (article quote), to fund predatory pricing. This deters new entrants, as per the syllabus’s contestable markets theory, entrenching monopoly power.”

A merit good refers to a good which carries a positive externality; beyond its benefit provided to the consumer, reflected in the form of the consumer’s demand curve, it also confers an additional, unrealized benefit on either the consumer or on a third-party besides the consumer and the producer. As consumers have insufficient information to realize the true benefit of the good, they undervalue the good and underconsume it as a result of that information failure. For instance, education is a typical case of a merit good: the actual benefit of getting an education is thought to exceed the market price attached to such an education, leading to fewer people receiving an education than is socially optimal.

A public good refers to a good which is both non-excludable, meaning that no consumer can be denied access to the good, and non-rivalrous, meaning that the consumption of the good by one consumer does not deny other consumers the consumption of the same good. For instance, national defense is a public good: as long as you are a citizen of your country you cannot be barred from enjoying the benefits of having a national defense, and you benefiting from national defense does not prevent another person from benefiting from it as well. 

In a market economy, it is very unlikely that enough of both goods will be produced – “enough” referring to the amount which is socially optimal and maximizes societal welfare. Merit goods suffer from information failure and underconsumption by definition; consumer demand for a merit good is less than what it should be because consumers do not realize the true value of the good, resulting in a market equilibrium that is less than the actual social optimum. Public goods will also be underproduced (or not produced at all) due to the existence of the free-rider problem: if firms choose to produce a public good, all consumers can enjoy that public good without being excluded from its benefits through paying a price (non-excludability) or through its consumption by another consumer (non-rivalry), leading to the lack of a profit motive for firms to produce that good because no consumer will pay for it. In other types of markets – a mixed economy, for instance – government intervention in the markets of both goods, which could take the form of subsidies (for merit goods like vaccines or green energy) or direct provision (for public goods like national defense), could mitigate the underconsumption and underproduction of merit and public goods, depending on whether the government is able to spend enough for sufficient provision.

In conclusion, whether merit goods and public goods are provided enough in a market depends on the type of economy the market is situated in – a market economy with no government intervention will lead to the underprovision of both types of goods, while a mixed economy could provide enough through government intervention – as well as, in a mixed economy in particular, the limits placed on government spending. If the market in question is situated within a mixed economy, and if government spending is sufficient to cover the direct provision of public goods, then the goods will be provided enough.

 Long-run economic growth is likely to need both growth of AD and AS
 Analysis of the role of supply side policy in achieving long-run economic
growth and its advantages and disadvantages. E.g., supply side policy
such as training and education is more likely to increase AS, but this can
also lead to an increase in AD, for example as better training leads to an
increase in income and therefore an increase in consumer spending. It is
also less likely to result in inflation. However, it is costly and will take time.
 Analysis of the extent to which supply side policy can lead to growth in
both AD and AS. For an explanation that a problem with supply side
policy is that it is less effective in directly increasing the level of AD.
 Analysis of at least one alternative policy e.g., fiscal policy or monetary
policy and how they may achieve long-run economic growth, together
with their advantages and disadvantages e.g., fiscal policy such as a
reduction in income tax is more likely to increase AD and can be relatively
quick. It may also indirectly lead to an increase in AS if more people are
encouraged to enter the workforce. However, if AS does not increase, it
may be inflationary. It may also reduce the amount available for
government spending.

On one hand, supply-side policy is certainly instrumental in ensuring long-run economic growth for a country. Supply-side policies encompass a wide range of policies aimed at increasing the productive capacity of the economy, thereby shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right and expanding the economy’s real output. Examples of such policies include subsidies on education, which seek to improve the level of skill and ability present in the workforce through providing more people with education and training, which would improve their productivities. Supply-side policies are an effective driver of long-run economic growth because they lead to sustainable improvements in the quantity and quality of a country’s factors of production, which benefit both producers and consumers; for instance, supply-side policies like education programs or a reduction in the income tax may allow a country’s citizens to benefit from increased levels of disposable income due to gaining skills that would allow them higher salaries, resulting in a simultaneous rise in aggregate demand as well. As such, supply-side policies are also desirable for long-run economic growth because they are less likely to be inflationary than other types of policies: if economic growth derives from a shift in the long-run AS curve or a simultaneous shift of the AS and AD curves to the right, then the potentially inflationary effects of a price-level rise brought by an increase in AD will be counteracted by an increase in AS, effectively preventing economic growth at the expense of eroding consumer purchasing powers. 

However, it can be argued that supply-side policies carry an innate uncertainty and risk that make it unsuitable for ensuring long-run economic growth. Supply-side policies like immigration reform to allow for an influx of skilled foreign workers have an uncertain effect on the economy, as it is not guaranteed that skilled immigrants will be attracted to the country or that such immigration can occur within a short period of time; in general, from education programs to infrastructure reform, supply-side policies are costly and slow, requiring a great amount of government expenditure for effects that may occur a generation later. Even then, the benefits can be indirect and difficult to observe: for instance, an increase in the literacy rate through supply-side policy may increase disposable incomes which increase AD, but the ultimate effect on AD is hard to guarantee, meaning that supply-side policy cannot influence consumer demand – a crucial component of long-run economic growth – directly.  

On the other hand, an alternative to supply-side policies in ensuring long-run economic growth is fiscal policy, aimed at influencing AD through two avenues: an increase in government spending or a reduction in tax rates. Fiscal policy is direct and effective in driving economic growth; for instance, a reduction in income tax rates immediately increases the disposable income of consumers, allowing them to spend more on consumption, which in turn raises real output in the circular flow of income. As such, any form of fiscal policy has immediate and controllable effects on the economy’s real output: a government can control exactly how much it wants to spend or how much it wants to reduce tax rates, which grants it more control over its future economic growth. Moreover, fiscal policy can also stimulate AS simultaneously with AD: for instance, a reduction in income taxes would incentivize workers to seek employment, as the real value of wages have increased from a reduction in the percentage taxed away. This would lead to both an expansion in consumer demand and an expansion in productive capacity, which counteracts inflationary pressures exerted by an increase in AD and results in more sustainable growth.

However, it could be argued that fiscal policy is not a sustainable nor a long-term driver of economic growth. Fiscal policy is ultimately a short-run policy: it stimulates consumption or spending in the present and cannot ensure that the economy’s productive capacity, or AS, will cope with this rise in demand. If AS does not rise alongside AD, fiscal policy will exert inflationary pressures on the economy through a rise in the price level; the result of inflation is an erosion of consumers’ purchasing powers, leading to lower levels of consumer confidence and a reduced level of spending in the long-run despite an immediate rise in consumption. Fiscal policy is also an irresponsible policy when the government does not have a sufficient budget surplus to enact government spending: if the spending is discretionary in nature, i.e. it is not spent on education or infrastructure or for any other particular purpose, then a rise in government spending from fiscal policy would limit government expenditures on important programs like healthcare or education, which would potentially damage long-run growth prospects.

In conclusion, supply-side policies are the most effective way to achieve long-run economic growth only under certain conditions. Supply-side policies can only realize their full potential over the long-term, and is less able to immediately stimulate AD or AS; as such, if an immediate demand-side stimulus is needed to pull the economy out of a recession or increase consumer confidence, fiscal policy would be much more suitable in ensuring a stable economic environment in the short-run as a foundation for long-run economic growth, while supply-side policies will be limited in effectiveness. In addition, only some forms of supply-side policies will result in sustainable long-run growth: any increase in long-run AS (productive capacity) needs to be matched with a rise in AD, and supply-side policies like deregulation will stimulate consumption in the long-run far less than education programs or reductions in income taxes, which increase disposable incomes simultaneously with productive capacities. Finally, whether supply-side policies will be successful versus fiscal policies depend on the political situation at the time: both types of policies are liable to reduce a government’s budget surplus, with supply-side policies like education requiring large amounts of spending and fiscal policies like tax cuts reducing tax revenues, but certain supply-side policies may be politically unpopular depending on the political situation – for instance, immigration reform in times of nationalistic sentiment, or dismantling labor unions in times of anti-corporate sentiment. Supply-side policies can be the most effective way to achieve long-run economic growth, but only if there are no pressing economic concerns in the short-term, if the type of policy chosen can stimulate AD and AS simultaneously, and if the political climate is not hostile to the policies used.

    Question: 'The free market is not the way to achieve a sustainable, efficient use of economic resources. Even the famous economist Adam Smith recognised that there was a need for some government involvement.'
Discuss whether government involvement in the economy might overcome the weaknesses of the free market system. [25]

    Question type: A-Level, 25 marks.

    Mark Scheme: 
    Candidates need to answer in terms of market failure and the meaning of the efficient use of
resources and then consider the argument. Market failure can be explained by reference to
possible excessive profits, the need for very large investments, the existence of externalities,
merit goods and of the need for public goods.
Government intervention can be through regulation, taxation, subsides, or ownership. Price policy
should be to achieve economic efficiency. Economic efficiency should be explained in terms of
productive and allocative efficiency. Neither is necessarily achieved simply because the
government is involved in the production of the good or service.
L4 (18–25) For a thorough explanation of both efficiencies and market failures and a
competent discussion of the role of the government in promoting efficiency
overcoming market failure. A reasoned conclusion should be presented.
L3 (14–17) For a competent explanation with either a comment on both efficiency and market
failure (perhaps concentrating on productive efficiency) or a full explanation of
one but little comment on the other. The role of the government will be discussed
in a limited way but a conclusion should still be presented.
L2 (10–13) For an undeveloped explanation of efficiency/market failure with very little
discussion of the role of the government. Mention of the government will be
descriptive rather than in the form of a discussion related to efficiency/market
failure. It is likely there will be no conclusion.
L1 (1–9) For an answer which shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the
question has been fully grasped, or where the answer contains irrelevancies and
errors of theory.

    A free market system is associated with the capitalist ideology where all resources are privately owned. Hence all economic decisions are made by individual households and firms who act in their own self interest. The essence of a market system is price mechanism, often quoted as "invisible hand". Operating on its own, without government intervention, price mechanism allocates resources through million of decisions taken each day by consumers and businesses. So, it is believed that apparently chaotic system of millions of transactions would not only allocate resources but it would do it efficiently.
Efficiency generally relates to how well an economy uses its scarce resources to satisfy maximum wants of consumers. 

When economists use the term efficiency they usually mean allocative and productive efficiency. Allocative efficiency is when right amount of scarce resources are allocated to produce right products. It occurs when the consumers' valuation (P) of a product equals the cost of resources (marginal cost) used up in its production i.e. p = MC; at that point, all units produced impart a net marginal social benefit, up to the very last unit, where marginal social benefits equal marginal social costs – resulting in a socially optimal outcome. Productive efficiency refers to firms' costs of production and can be applied both to the short run and long run. It exists when producers minimize the wastage of resources i.e when they produce a product using the least possible resources or generating the lowest possible per unit cost. The graph below shows this.

(DIAGRAM: productive efficiency)




The curve AC3 suggests productive efficiency because it indicates the lowest possible cost techniques of production for different levels of output. All other curves above AC3 indicate higher per unit cost therefore they all suggest productive inefficiency. Furthermore, economists use the term technical efficiency when a firm produces at the lowest point (z) on the lowest average cost curve.
The theory of firm predicts that each firm in a perfectly competitive market produces at the lowest point on its LRAC curve and it is not possible for any one firm to reduce its cost any further by altering its output. Every firm in perfect competition is therefore productively efficient. This is shown in the graph below.

(DIAGRAM: cost curves for perfect competition)


It can be analyzed from the graph that perfectly competitive firms maximize profits by equating marginal cost to price. Thus, when perfect competition is the market structure for the whole economy, price is equal to marginal cost in each line of production resulting in allocative efficiency.

On the contrary, a profit maximizing firm operating under imperfect market conditions will maximize profits at an output ( q) where price exceeds marginal cost, hence leading to an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. Also the firm produces at the decreasing part of AC curve that indicates its failure to optimize use of resources.
It is held that even the competitive outcome of markets is not efficient from the point of view of society as a whole. In those cases market system is believed to have failed and it, therefore, results in a loss of economic and social welfare. This is because the benefits that the free-market confers on individuals or businesses carrying out a particular activity diverge from the benefits to the society as a whole.

The existence of externalities, for instance, causes market forces to fail to allocate resource at socially optimum level. An externality occurs whenever actions by firms or consumers impose costs or confer benefits on others that are not involved in the transaction. The essence of the problem created by externalities is that market forces will lead to either too little or too much production. With a positive externality, a competitive free market will produce too little of the good and with a negative externality it produces too much of the good. 

Another important cause of market failure is imperfect information. The reason for this is that party to a transaction can often take an advantage by shifting costs onto the other party. More generally, whenever either party to a transaction lacks information that the other party has, or is deceived by false claims, the outcome of market forces changes and these changes may lead to inefficiency.

Merit and demerit goods are a clear case of imperfect information. Consumers don't perceive quite well how good or bad a particular product is for them: either they do not have the right information or they simply lack some relevant information. The problem is that imperfect information causes market forces to lead to an inappropriate amount of merit and demerit goods being produced or consumed.

A distinct type of market failure exists in case of public goods. A good must possess three distinguishing characteristics to qualify as a public good. It must be non-excludible, non-rival and non-rejectable. These features give rise to the free rider problem; people receiving benefits from a good without contributing to its cost. Thus it develops a situation in which everyone believes that others will take on the burden of paying for goods such as national defense and streetlights. Since the exclusion principle does not apply to these goods, private enterprises have no economic incentive to supply them. So we have goods which yield substantial benefits but to which the market system fails to allocate resources.
The role of the government is to intervene in markets that are not seen to be allocating and using resources in the most efficient manner. Government policy and methods of intervention can be summarized under four broad headings: regulation, financial intervention, direct provision and improving information.

In case of financial intervention indirect taxes such as changes in VAT and excise duties can be used to raise the price of demerit goods and products with negative externalities. Subsidies to consumers will lower the price of merit goods such as grants to students to reduce the internal costs of staying on in fulltime education. In addition to providing the finance it is also possible for a government to take over the production of a good or service, either in whole or in part. State-owned industries are often referred to as nationalized industries such as the electricity, coal mining and railway industries are entirely owned and managed by the state in many countries. It is also very common to find some goods and services being produced by both the state and the private sectors. Education and health care are particularly good examples of these types of service.

Government action can have a role in improving information to help consumers and producers value the 'true' cost and/or benefit of a good or service. Thus a failure to deliver efficient use of resources by the free market system is normally considered as justification for some form of government involvement in the economy. This intervention, however, should be designed to correct market failure with the view to achieve an improvement in economic and social welfare.

An oligopoly market refers to a market structure dominated by a few relatively large firms, usually producing many different brands of products. It is characterized primarily by interdependence between firms: each firm is sufficiently large so that decisions taken by it will affect decisions taken by all other firms as well. An oligopoly is also characterized by a high degree of market concentration, imperfect knowledge, and high levels of barriers to entry, resulting in each firm having some level of price-making powers; as such, each firm makes its pricing decisions based on how other firms will respond to such decisions, leading to there being no single theory of price determination in an oligopoly market.

On the other hand, perfect competition describes an ideal market structure consisting of a large number of homogeneous small firms producing undifferentiated products which are perfect substitutes. The market is characterized by perfect information and nonexistent barriers to entry or exit; each firm has a very limited amount of market power, resulting in them becoming price takers. As such, firms have no power over their selling price, which is also their marginal revenue; they maximize profit by producing where their individual marginal costs equal the market-wide marginal revenue, which is determined by market forces of demand and supply rather than the decisions of an individual firm.

Oligopoly markets typically experience less price fluctuation than a perfectly competitive market because of how prices are determined in oligopoly markets. There are several ways in which an oligopoly market may determine its prices. First is price competition; firms out-compete other firms and attract customers by setting lower prices, but interdependence in an oligopoly means that if one firm sets lower prices, other firms will respond to that decision by setting even lower prices in turn. As such, the demand curve facing a firm when it tries to decrease prices from the market equilibrium can be characterized as very price inelastic (PED < 1): a reduction in price will not increase demand by much, as other firms will also reduce their prices in response and consumers will not change their decisions. If instead a firm decides to increase their prices in hopes of earning higher profits, all other firms will lower prices in response to attract more customers; as a result, the firm setting higher prices will become less desirable than all other firms in the market and demand will fall sharply. This can be characterized as a price-elastic (PED > 1) demand curve above the equilibrium price: a rise in price leads to a sharp fall in demand. All in all, price competition in an oligopoly is characterized by an inelastic demand curve below the market equilibrium and an elastic demand curve above it; this is known as a kinked demand curve, as pictured below:

(DIAGRAM: kinked demand curve.)

Either increasing or decreasing prices would sharply hurt a firm’s profits; remaining at the current market equilibrium price is the optimal decision for all firms, leading to price rigidity. This stands in contrast to a firm in a perfectly competitive market, whose pricing decisions are not determined by the firm itself, but rather by market forces of supply and demand that may fluctuate based on consumer tastes and other economic conditions. 

Other forms of price determination within an oligopoly also explain its price rigidity relative to perfectly competitive markets. An alternate theory of price competition concerns the Prisoner’s Dilemma inherent within an oligopoly market: as stated, if a firm sets its price high, all other firms will set their prices low and the firm setting high prices will lose out on all its consumers. As such, the optimal decision for all firms without knowing the decision of any other firm – a condition which holds in a market with imperfect information, such as an oligopoly – is to set low prices; this results in a Nash equilibrium where every firm is making their own optimal decision and has no incentive to change without changes being made by another firm. However, such an equilibrium is not the absolutely optimal outcome; if all firms set their prices high without undercutting any other firm, the level of profits present in the entire market would exceed the Nash equilibrium. This frequently gives rise to collusive behaviors between firms, either through a formal agreement to fix high prices and form a cartel – an entity which acts like a monopoly and sets its own prices, impervious to market forces of supply and demand, resulting in more price rigidity than perfect competition – or through tacit collusion and price leadership. Price leadership involves no formal agreements; instead, firms in an oligopoly follow the pricing decisions made by another firm which is seen as the dominant firm in the market, or the most knowledgeable firm. Firms have an incentive to follow another firm’s pricing decisions because they often want to avoid price wars arising from repeated price undercutting of other firms, which lead to unsustainably low prices that hurt every firm involved; as such, the decisions made by one firm will often set rigid prices for the rest of the market – this is known as barometric price leadership. 

As such, oligopolistic firms tend to avoid price competition; instead, firms either remain in a stable equilibrium marked by a kinked demand curve and are not incentivized to change prices, or follow the pricing decisions of a price leader and do not fluctuate their prices beyond that. Instead, oligopolistic firms compete through non-price competition such as reducing costs through research and development, producing differentiated products or a wider variety of products to satisfy consumers, or advertising their brand – none of which alter the rigidity of the market price.

    Question: Discuss whether a firm in monopolistic competition is more likely to be in the public interest than a firm that is a monopoly. [13]

    Question Type: A-Level, 13 marks.

    Mark Scheme: 
    (b) Discuss whether a firm in monopolistic competition is more likely to be in the public
interest than a firm that is a monopoly. [13]

Discussion of the characteristics of the two types of market structure. Long run profit will be
normal in monopolistic competition but not necessarily so in monopoly. Output is likely to be
lower in monopoly; prices are likely to be higher. However, there may be merits of large
scale monopoly firms through economies of scale. It may be difficult to make a general
overall judgement.
L4 For a sound discussion with good explanation of the analysis and a clear understanding
of the differences between the two market structures together with a conclusion [9–13]
L3 For a competent comment but with more limited discussion of the two market structures
but still with a conclusion [7–8]
L2 For a brief explanation of the structures, limited discussion and no conclusion [5–6]
L1 For an answer which has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies. Errors of
theory or omissions of analysis will be substantial. [1–4]

    This is a 13-mark question. Remember to answer in continuous prose and follow the guideline for 13-mark questions provided in the system prompt.

According to economic theory a monopoly exists when there is one firm in the industry. It is characterized by selling a unique product and high entry barriers. Compared with other market structures, demand under monopoly will be relatively inelastic at each price. This gives monopolist substantial powers to charge a high price. Nevertheless, it is still constrained by its demand curve i.e. a rise in price will lower the quantity demanded. In order for a firm to maintain its monopoly position there must be barriers to the entry of new firms. Barriers can be of various forms, such as economies of scale, high capital cost, legal barriers and various marketing barriers.

Monopolistic competition incorporates features of both perfect competition and monopoly. As with perfect competition, there is freedom of entry into the industry; there are many relatively small firms in the market, each producing goods which are slightly different from their competitors. The existence of product differentiation means that firms have a certain degree of monopoly power; thus, if they raise their price they do not lose all their buyers even though they produce products which are close substitutes. The result is a downward sloping relatively elastic demand curve. As a result, a monopolistically competitive firm is not a price taker. Product differentiation can be reinforced through advertising which produces an element of brand loyalty.

Under monopolistic competition, freedom of entry eliminates supernormal profit and forces the firm to produce where its AR = AC; in the long-run, prices are kept down as any supernormal profits will lead to new firms joining the market, reducing demand for any individual firm’s products and thereby reducing prices, forcing every firm to operate at a level of normal profit which minimizes average total costs. Under monopoly, however, barriers to entry allow profits to remain supernormal in the long run; no profits are “competed away” by other firms joining the market. Hence the monopolist is not forced to produce where its AR = AC. Thus, other things remaining the same, a comparison of profit maximizing position for an industry under monopoly with that of a firm in monopolistic competition reveals that long run price will tend to be higher and output lower under monopoly. 

Whether a monopolistically competitive firm is more in the public interest than a monopolistic firm can be assessed through the lens of several types of efficiencies. Neither type of firm is allocatively efficient, characterized by producing where price equals marginal cost and every unit produced confers a net marginal benefit to society, thus reaching an optimum in terms of maximizing social welfare; both types of firms face a downward-sloping demand curve and thus produce at a point where price exceeds marginal cost. In this sense, neither type of firm is in the public interest.

In terms of productive efficiency, which refers to producing at the minimum possible average total cost (ATC), a monopolistically competitive market will produce at exactly the quantity where ATC is minimized in the long-run; 
competition and availability of close substitutes requires the firm in a monopolistically competitive market to use the most efficient known technique to retain normal profits.  In contrast, the monopolist sheltered by barriers to entry can still make large profits even if it is not using the most efficient technique, thus having no incentive to produce at the productively efficient minimum ATC or to reduce its costs over time; this is known as X-inefficiency, and also results in productive inefficiency.

In addition to this monopolies may lack the incentive to introduce new product varieties and large monopolies may be able to exert political pressure and thereby get favourable treatment from the government. It could be argued that public interest would be better served through the degree of product variety and consumer choice present with a monopolistically competitive firm, which offers a differentiated product different from the rest of the market, unlike a monopoly.

However, this analysis depends on several economic factors which determine the efficiencies of the two types of firms. First, monopolies operate on a larger scale than monopolistically competitive firms, which are assumed to be small with little market power; as such, monopolies could benefit from several forms of economies of scale, for instance bulk-buying economies of scale where inputs are sourced at a cheaper rate in bulk or managerial economies of scale from centralized administration. In the long-run, the economies of scale enjoyed by a monopoly would lead to lower average total costs which, despite not being productively efficient, could be less costly than that of a monopolistically competitive firm and result in lower prices being charged for the product, which is in the public interest as far as consumers are concerned. Furthermore, monopolies retain some measure of supernormal profit as a result of barriers to entry, while monopolistically competitive firms do not; a monopolist could re-invest excess profits into research and development or innovation, leading to improvements in product quality and a dynamic efficiency marked by a reduction in costs over time – an efficiency which monopolistically competitive firms will not be able to achieve. Finally, government regulation may be able to curb the societally harmful aspects of a monopoly while retaining its benefits to the public interest: for instance, a quota on the monopolist to produce at the exact quantity where price equals marginal cost will force the monopolist to become allocatively efficient, assuming that such regulatory policies do not require too much excess costs on the government  to enforce. 

In conclusion, although both monopolies and monopolistically competitive firms are allocatively inefficient, monopolistically competitive firms generally serve the public interest more by producing a greater variety of goods and achieving productive efficiency by minimizing average total costs; however, in cases where monopolies can benefit from economies of scale and re-invest excess profits into research and development, and where monopolies are carefully regulated by the government, the dynamic efficiency provided by a monopoly may serve the public interest more in the long-run by reducing costs and increasing product qualities.
