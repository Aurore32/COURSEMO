Consider with the help of a circular flow diagram, why an export led growth policy is likely to be successful when a developed economy is in a recession.
Export led growth is dependent on an outward growth strategy which relies heavily on openness and increased international trade. Successful growth should lead to an increase in national income, output, and employment. Concentration on the expansion of exports should be a key factor determining an increase in aggregate demand, output, and employment. This can be clearly illustrated, using a circular flow diagram which shows all withdrawals, all injections, and the change in national income equilibrium achievable via export led economic growth. This diagram should be clearly labelled and accurate showing an increase in injections (exports) producing a bigger increase in output/income/employment via the multiplier. An economy is in a recession when its GDP falls for two successive quarterly time periods. Recession will generally be accompanied by rising levels of unemployment due to a fall in aggregate monetary demand.
Government can use different economic policies to stimulate aggregate demand to move an economy out of a recession. Lower interest rates might be used to encourage investment, but this might have a limited effect due to low confidence. Government expenditure might be increased but this will depend upon the state of the public finances. When national debt is high this policy option might not be adopted. However, a policy which stimulates the growth of exports might avoid these problems and simultaneously protect the value of the domestic currency while maintaining a positive balance of payments. The effectiveness of this approach will depend upon the existing exchange rate regime used and the type of policy used, for example, lowering interest rates to depreciate a floating currency which should lead to a higher level of export growth.

82,82,Discuss the effectiveness of government policies which increase the net advantage of labour on the long–term supply of labour in an economy. [12],"a

Discuss the effectiveness of government policies which increase the net advantage of labour on the long term supply of labour in an economy.
Government policies which increase the net advantage of labour will increase the supply of labour in the long run and this can be shown by a shift downwards to the right of the supply curve of labour. This means more workers will be supplied at every wage rate. The net advantage of labour can be divided into pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements. The former might include: wages, salary and bonus payments. Non-pecuniary advantages might include: hours of work, job security, promotion prospects and nature of the work. Reductions in income tax, increasing the minimum wage and the provision of skill training could be used to increase the pecuniary element of the net advantage.
However tax reductions might lead to a fall in supply because some workers will substitute work for leisure. The provision of skill training is expensive therefore has a high opportunity cost. Minimum wage might increase the supply of labour but firm’s might lower their demand for labour and therefore create excess supply. Alternatively, a government can introduce new regulations to ensure worker’s rights such as flexible working hours, working conditions, safety at work etc. Although this extra support will benefit workers new regulations are often costly to implement. In some cases it is the firm which is expected to finance improvement in working conditions and this might lead to a fall in profitability and ultimately a fall in demand for labour
L4 (9–12 marks): For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the meaning of net advantage of labour and links this to a labour supply curve. At least one policy to increase the pecuniary element of labour supply and one policy to increase the non-pecuniary element should be analysed. In both cases some evaluative comment should enable comment on the effectiveness of the policy.

High market concentration ratios are closely linked to Oligopoly market structures.Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm.
Some industries are dominated by a few large firms. A concentration ratio indicates the extent to which large firms might dominate an industry. For example, 4 large firms might control more than 80% of a market while a large number of small firms account for the remaining 20% of the market. In this case the four firm concentration ratio would be 80%.
Oligopolies are market structures which can be specifically identified by noting that there are only a few large firms which dominate the market i.e. they have high market concentration ratios and they also have high barriers to entry which maintains their dominant position. However, because of the nature of this type of market structure, firms have to take into account the reaction of their main rivals before adopting their pricing strategy i.e. they are interdependent. If a firm chooses to ignore the reactions of its main rivals, this could result in a price war where each firm loses potential revenue and consumers gain. As a result Oligopolies will often adopt alternative strategies to maintain/increase market share and maximise profits. Sometimes firms will collude and agree to fix a price. This is illegal but it is still used.
Alternatively, the dominant firm within the group might become the price leader and set the market price which other large firms choose to follow. Game theory and the theory of the kinked demand curve can be used to assess which strategy might be the most effective. Most of these alternative pricing strategies will lead to price rigidity. It should be noted that many Oligopoly firms will adopt non price competition such as advertising or increasing product differentiation to avoid the negative impact of price competition.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear explanation of what is meant by a high market concentration ratio and an attempt to link this to an Oligopoly market structure. Analysis of alternative pricing policies which might subsequently be adopted will be provided and an assessment of their likely impact on a firm's profits/market share.

86,86,Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12],"a

Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide.
Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.
Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.
In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.

Explain, with the help of a diagram, explain the Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap and consider the importance of the liquidity trap to government policy makers when an economy is in a recession.
The Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap relies heavily upon the Keynesian theory of interest rate determination. This theory assumes that the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money. It is also assumed that the demand for money becomes perfectly elastic when the rate of interest on securities becomes very low and that the supply of money is perfectly inelastic because it is determined solely by the Central Bank. This can be illustrated by a supply and demand diagram. When an economy is in a recession, GDP will be falling, incomes will be low and unemployment will be relatively high.
Monetary policy such as lowering interest rates might be used to stimulate aggregate demand and move the economy out of a recession. However, according to Keynesian theory, when interest rates reach a very low level, an increase in the money supply to stimulate the economy will have no effect because this policy will have no further effect on interest rates. This form of monetary will no longer work. A diagram can support this conclusion by clearly identifying the liquidity trap. If policy makers recognise the existence of a liquidity trap, they might then choose to rely on alternative policies to move an economy out of a recession. Alternative measures might include: a devaluation of the domestic currency if is based on a fixed exchange rate; the use of expansionary fiscal policies such as increased government spending and/or tax reduction; or various supply side measures to increase productivity

Explain what is meant by the marginal revenue product theory and consider the relationship between this theory and a trades union's ability to gain higher wages for its members.
Marginal revenue product theory is a theory which explains what determines the demand for labour. The value of an individual worker’s marginal revenue product is made up of two parts. The marginal physical product of a worker multiplied by the marginal revenue gained by the firm when the product is sold will determine the worker’s marginal revenue product. It is assumed that each firm in all labour markets are profit maximisers and will therefore employ workers up to the point where the worker’s marginal product is equal to the marginal cost of employing this extra unit of labour. In this case, either an increase in worker productivity (increase in worker MPP) or an increase in the marginal revenue gained (MR) will increase MRP. This will shift the demand curve (MRP curve) to the right and indicate an increase in the demand for labour.
The extent to which this increase in demand will enable Trades Unions to negotiate higher wages will be determined to some extent by the nature of the labour market in which they operate. In a perfectly competitive labour market analysis will focus on a situation where wage rates are determined by the supply of and the demand for labour. In this case trade unions can raise the demand for labour by increasing training and ultimately MRP.
However wages will only rise if the MRP of all labour in all firms increase. If the increase is confined to one firm, wages will not rise. In a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the marginal revenue product theory and analyses the potential impact of a Trades Union’s ability to change MRP in both a perfectly competitive labour market and an imperfect labour market. A conclusion should summarize the differences between the two markets.

A limited attempt will be made to show how Trades Unions can bargain for higher wages but the analysis will not be fully developed.

Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.
Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply.

Explain what is meant by a transmissions mechanism of monetary policy and consider why it might not work in practice.
Monetary transmissions mechanisms attempt to explain how changes in monetary policy might have an impact on key macroeconomic goals such as national income, output, employment and inflation.
Answers may explain either the Keynesian model or an alternative model based on a central bank changing the base rate of interest. Keynes suggested that an increase in the money supply might affect real variables such as output and employment because this would be transmitted by a fall in interest rates, leading to a rise in investment/aggregate monetary demand and ultimately an increase in GDP and employment. However, Keynes also identified a number of reasons why this approach might not work effectively in practice. Reasons might include: the existence of a liquidity trap; an interest inelastic investment; a relatively low multiplier effect; negative effect of a rise in income on interest rates.
A similar approach might be adopted in relation to the use of a central bank’s mechanism to change interest rates to control the rate of inflation. Again, the success of this approach will rely heavily upon the strength of the links between a change in monetary policy and each of the variables which will determine the final outcome.

In this case trade unions can raise wages without loss of jobs, by increasing training and ultimately MRP. However, if wage increases are obtained by collective bargaining, which establishes a higher minimum wage, this might be achieved at a cost of significant job losses.
Similarly, in a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer.

Firms in perfect competition and firms in monopolistic competition will only achieve normal profits in the long run. This means that firms in both these types of market structure are equally efficient.
Discuss, with the help of diagrams, the extent to which you agree with this statement.
The main types of efficiency will be explained including: allocative efficiency, productive efficiency and possibly dynamic efficiency. Reference to the long run position in perfect competition in combination with definitions of efficiency should allow that firms in perfect competition will achieve both allocative and productive efficiency in the long run. Similarly, reference to a long run position in monopolistic competition using the same definitions of efficiency should enable candidates to conclude that a firm in monopolistic competition will not be allocatively efficient i.e. will not produce where AR=MC and it will not produce at the minimum point of its long run average total cost curve. Therefore it will not operate at an optimum level of output.
Answers which point out that the firm in monopolistic competition will be operating at a productively efficient level of output in the long run are acceptable provided it is clear that the definition of productive efficiency is stated as 'the minimum unit cost attainable for a given level of output'. A conclusion would point out that a perfectly competitive firm is therefore likely to be more efficient than it monopolistically competitive counterpart. Good responses might refer to dynamic efficiency and given the small size of firms in both types of market structure, neither firm would be able to benefit from this type of efficiency.

Explain what economists mean by a public good and discuss why the provision of such a good is associated with market failure.
Answers should provide a clear explanation of the meaning of a public good. Key characteristics: non rival; non excludable should be identified. Some reference to non- divisible/non-rejectable might also be referred to. Examples provided might include: street lighting/national defence/lighthouse
The link between the characteristics of a public good and the difficulty associated with the provision of such a good by the free market should be established i.e. the ‘free rider problem’ Market failure should be discussed in the context of allocative inefficiency. Allocative efficiency is attained when resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction. If public goods are not provided, consumer satisfaction is unlikely to be maximised, hence unless the State provides public goods, market failure will occur.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains the key characteristics of a public good and analyses the links between allocative efficiency and the concept of market failure. An attempt should be made to evaluate the potential impact on total consumer satisfaction if certain public are not provided. A conclusion should be provided which might comment on the importance of public goods and how a government can help to address this type of potential market failure.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent comment which clearly defines the concept of a public good and market failure together with limited elaboration of the analysis or imprecise links in the argument. Evaluation will not be fully developed and no attempt will be made to provide a conclusion to summarize the preceding argument.

Consider, with the help of a circular flow diagram, the potential impact of a fall in the rate of interest on the level of output and the level of employment.
Candidates should produce an accurate, clearly labelled, three sector circular flow diagram. Injections and withdrawals should be clearly identified. The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained. Also the links between expenditure, output and employment should be explained. The full employment level of income, expenditure and output should be labelled on the diagram. Analysis should then examine the potential impact of a fall in the rate of interest on withdrawals. For example, savings and imports, or injections for example, investment and exports. The extent of the potential impact should be discussed in each case. For example, a fall in interest rates is likely to reduce the level of savings and increase the level of consumer spending. This will produce higher levels of expenditure, output and employment.
However, the overall impact will also be affected by any subsequent change in the multiplier effect. If the marginal propensity to save falls significantly, the multiplier will increase and the overall impact on output and employment will be substantial. The impact on investment (injection) will also depend upon factors such as the interest elasticity of investment and/or the current level of confidence of potential investors. Reference might be made to the importance of locating the current state of the economy before the fall in the rate of interest takes place. If there is a lot of existing spare capacity, the impact of a fall in interest rates on output and employment is likely to be significant.
L4 (9–12 marks) for an answer which uses circular flow theory to analyse the relationship between expenditure, income, output and employment. Analysis should be supported by an appropriate diagram. The impact of a fall in the rate of interest should be considered in relation to at least one withdrawal and one injection. Some evaluative comment should be provided in each case. A conclusion should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks) for analysis which explains the circular flow model and identifies withdrawals and injections. Full employment equilibrium will also be identified. Analysis will focus upon either one withdrawal or one injection but it should be supported by a diagram and at least one evaluative comment.
L2 (5–6 marks) for a less well-developed comment which describes the circular flow of income and identifies withdrawals and injections and makes some reference to the full employment level of income. There will be no evidence of analysis which examines the impact of a fall in the rate of interest on either withdrawals or injections. Diagrams might not be accurately labelled.
L1 (1–4 marks) for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

A profit maximising firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market might decide to increase the number of workers it employs but it will not choose to increase its workers' wage rates.
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Key assumptions which underpin the theory of a perfectly competitive labour market should include: homogeneous labour; perfect mobility of labour, no barriers to entry, firms are wage takers; perfect knowledge. A profit maximising firm operating in this market will employ labour up to the point where the marginal product of labour is equal to the wage paid to labour. An explanation of the link between MRP and the demand for labour should be provided. It should also be noted that the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at a wage determined by the market forces of supply of and demand for labour. If the productivity of workers within the firm increases or the price received by this firm increase, then the demand for labour will rise and more workers will be employed.
However, the wage rate will not change. If a firm in perfect competition allowed an increase in its worker's wages it would no longer maximise profits at the new level of output. Therefore this would support the statement in the question. Similarly, if a firm in a perfectly competitive labour market decided to raise wages with an increase in MRP, profits would only be maximised if the level of employment fell. It should be recognised in a conclusion that both wages and employment could rise at the same time if any of the conditions which determine market demand or market supply change. In this case each firm will receive a perfectly elastic supply of labour at a higher wage rate.
L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound discussion that explains what is meant by a perfectly competitive labour market and how the profit maximising level of employment will be determined based on the supply of and demand for labour by the firm. Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the statement in the question might be true. A conclusion should refer to and consider the relationship between the labour market and the supply of labour to each firm.
L3 (7–8 marks) for a competent comment with limited analysis that recognises what constitutes a perfect labour market and the profit maximising level of employment in this market. Some attempt might be made to address the specific question but the analysis will not be fully developed. No conclusion will be provided.

158,158,Explain what economists mean by indifference curves and budget lines and evaluate whether they might be used together to support rational consumer decision making. [12],"a

Explain what economists mean by indifference curves and budget lines and evaluate whether they might be used together to support rational consumer decision making.
Indifference curves describe all the combinations of two goods which when consumed will give an equal level of consumer satisfaction. This is why consumers are indifferent regarding which point on the curve they might attain. Typical indifference curves will be convex to the origin and downward sloping from left to right. Budget lines establish all the combinations of two goods which can be purchased given the price of each good and subject to an income constraint. This will be a straight line, sloping downwards from left to right.
A consumer will be considered to be in equilibrium when maximum consumer satisfaction is attained. This is when the consumer is able to reach a point on the furthest indifference curve from the origin while spending all their available income. On a diagram it is where the consumer budget line is at a tangent with this indifference curve. It is important to note that this point can only be attained by rational consumer decision making. This assumes: consumers always want to maximise satisfaction, that consumers can measure the total satisfaction obtained when consuming a combination of goods and that no external influences, for example advertising, might lead to irrational decision making.
L4 (9–12 marks) for a clear explanation of the concept of an indifference curve and a budget line. This might be supported by the use of clearly labelled accurate diagrams. Rational consumer decision making can then be explained either verbally or by combination of description plus diagrams. Evaluative comments should be provided and discussed.
L3 (7–8 marks) for an accurate reference to the question and the use of clear indifference curve analysis to illustrate how a rational consumer might maximise satisfaction subject to an income constraint.
L2 (5–6 marks) for a briefer descriptive comment that demonstrates some understanding of what is meant by indifference curves and budget lines but does not make the clear link between maximising consumer satisfaction and rational consumer decision making. No critical evaluation will be provided.

Explain what is meant by dynamic efficiency and consider which type of market structure is most likely to achieve dynamic efficiency.
Answers should provide a clear explanation of the meaning of dynamic efficiency which refers to the use of profits to re-invest in research and development to reduce long run average total costs. The effect on a firm’s long run average total cost curve should be clearly explained. And existing average total cost will move entirely in a downwards direction, showing that as a result of investment, the firm has now reduced its average total cost curve at every level of output.
There are four types of market structure. Firms operating in a perfectly competitive market and firms operating in a monopolistically competitive market are unlikely to be able to achieve dynamic efficiency. This is primarily due to both types of market consisting of small firms which make it very difficult to gain sufficient profits to enable investment in research and development.
However, monopoly and oligopoly firms are likely to be large and be able to generate sufficient profits to benefit from investment in research and development and gain dynamic efficiency. It is more likely that a monopoly will generate sufficient profits because they will have full market control whereas an oligopoly might need to use profits to use non price competition to maintain their market share. Although it should also be recognised that some monopolies might simply use profits to increase shareholder dividends or dynamic efficiency might not be achieved due to X inefficiency.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains, the concept and analysis of dynamic efficiency. Each of the three main types of market structure should be discussed and an attempt should be made to conclude which market is most likely to achieve dynamic market efficiency.

Explain what economists mean by the marginal propensity to consume and consider the importance of this concept in relation to government macroeconomic policy.An individual's marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the proportion of any additional income received by the individual which is spent on consumption. Basic Keynesian economic theory assumes that the marginal propensity to consume remains constant regardless of the level of an individual's level of income. It is more realistic to assume that the marginal propensity to consume will fall as individual income increases. Government macroeconomic policy focuses on key goals, including: high employment; high growth; low/stable inflation; stable balance of payments/exchange rate; re-distributing income. It is possible to link the concept of marginal propensity to consume to each of these key goals. For example, a government may increase expenditure to increase aggregate demand to increase output and employment. The ultimate impact of this additional expenditure will be determined by the multiplier effect which in turn, will be determined by the value of the marginal propensity to consume. Also, due to this multiplier effect, some of the subsequent further increase in income might be spent on purchasing imports and this is likely to have a negative impact on the balance of payments.L4 (9–12 marks): For a response which clearly explains the concept of the marginal propensity to consume.

Explain the factors which determine the elasticity of demand for labour and discuss the importance of the elasticity of demand for labour in relation to the effectiveness of a government's minimum wage policy. Responses should identify and explain some key factors which might determine the elasticity of demand for labour. Candidates might refer to: the proportion of labour costs in relation to a firm's total cost; the ease with which labour can be substituted by capital; the elasticity of the demand for the product produced; the time period under consideration. An attempt should then be made to link these factors in relation to a government’s minimum wage policy. For example, labour operating in a monopolistically competitive market is likely to be producing a product which has an elastic demand. This means that if the imposition of a minimum wage leads to higher prices, there will be a significant decrease in the demand for the product and subsequently, a significant rise in unemployment. This suggests that a government minimum wage policy will have a substantially negative effect on the labour market. A similar approach might be adopted in relation to other factors referred to above.

Explain and critically evaluate the quantity theory of money. The quantity theory of money is based on the assumption that there is a direct relationship between a change in the money supply and the rate of inflation. The theory uses the equation MV= PT. This assumes that V is constant and T is constant (i.e. consistent with the full employment level of transactions). On this basis, any change in M (the money supply) will have a direct effect on P (the price level). Critics question both of these assumptions and also point out that it is extremely difficult to measure the money supply and also difficult to effectively control the money supply.  L4 (9–12 marks) For a clear explanation of the quantity theory of money and the assumptions upon which this theory is based.

Distinguish between a country’s national debt and its public sector budget deficit and consider which is the more important.Candidates should clearly distinguish between the national debt and the public sector budget deficit. The national is the cumulative amount of debt which consists of the total amount of money borrowed from the private sector and other purchases of government securities since the government began borrowing. The public sector budget deficit occurs when a government spends more than its income in a particular time period, usually one year. Both are important due to their potential effects on the macro economy. Interest has to be paid on the national debt and this has an opportunity cost regarding the use of scarce public sector resources. The budget deficit has to be financed and this has important implications for the impact of this on key macroeconomic indicators. L4 (9–12 marks) For an answer that provides a clear explanation of both terms and why each is important in relation to macroeconomic policy. An attempt should be made to evaluate the relative importance of each indicator and also an attempt should be made to show how both elements are linked.

968,968,Consider the extent to which the commercial banks can influence the money supply. [12],"a
There are many definitions of the money supply. The narrow definition includes notes and coins in circulation and balances held by the commercial banks at the central bank. The more commonly used broad definition includes notes and coins in circulation and bank deposits. Bank deposits represent the largest part of the money supply. Commercial banks create new bank deposits every time they grant a loan. It is profitable for banks to create loans, so banks often have a significant effect on the broad definition of the money supply. However, there are limits to the ability of banks to create new deposits.

970,970,Distinguish between structural and frictional unemployment. Consider which would be likely to have the greater negative effect on an economy. [12],"a
Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand in an economy and is usually focused upon specific industries or geographical areas. It can also be caused by the introduction of new technology acting as a substitute for labour. Frictional (or search) unemployment arises due to imperfect information in the labour market. Workers are unemployed primarily due to the time taken to find a new job. Both types have a negative impact on an economy but it is generally assumed that structural unemployment will have a long-term impact and impose higher costs on society compared with frictional unemployment which normally lasts a relatively short time.

1030,1030,Explain the difference between price leadership and price discrimination. [12],"a
Motives for price leadership and/or price discrimination. Price leadership refers to a situation where prices and price changes are established by a dominant firm which other firms in the industry adopt and follow. When price leadership is used to facilitate collusion, the price leader will generally tend to set a price high enough so that the least cost-efficient firm in the market may earn some return above the competitive level. Price discrimination is the charging of different prices for the same product with same production costs.
