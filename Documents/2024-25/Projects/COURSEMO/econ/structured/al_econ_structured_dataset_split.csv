AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)For a clear and accurate explanation of three causes of unemployment from frictional, structural, cyclical (demand deficient), seasonal or technological (3×1).
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks) Each cause identified must be analysed, and judgements made about how damaging it might be for a high-income economy (3×1). For example, points to consider may include:

Frictional unemployment may be dependent on information provision.
Structural unemployment may be permanent and difficult to solve.
Cyclical unemployment depends on the economic cycle.
Seasonal depends on alternative sources of employment.
Technological depends on occupational or geographical immobility of labour.

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks) For an answer that clearly assesses how damaging each cause may be to a high-income developed economy in comparison with each other (1) that leads to a justified conclusion as to which may be the most damaging (1).

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

The analysis must focus on the advantages and disadvantages of using at least two expansionary macroeconomic policies to keep unemployment low. For example, one policy might be an expansionary supply-side policy with an emphasis on training and education which would allow people to be more employable, e.g., by having more relevant skills but it may be timeconsuming and costly.
This chosen policy must then be contrasted with an alternative policy / policies. For example, expansionary monetary policy may be suggested with the use of low interest rates to encourage investment and boost employment, but the investment may be directed towards more capitalintensive production.

Note. The focus of the question must be on how a low rate of unemployment may be achieved.
Level 1 responses will be assertive and lacking in explanations / mainly descriptive and/or or mainly lacking in relevance to the question.
Level 2 responses may contain some inaccuracies and will be one sided. Analysis will be explained at least in part and will be largely relevant to the question.

An explanation of the limitations of PED estimates – does not consider the prices of complements/substitutes; income level of the consumer; trends; ignores the relevance of costs so changes to profits are uncertain.
An explanation of how PES estimates would be useful to business owners - the potential to invest in spare capacity which can be used if demand rises; increase overtime payments to increase production; whether or not to outsource to other firms who can meet supply.
An explanation of the limitations of PES estimates – e.g., practical ability to increase the PES; the associated costs in making supply more elastic/responsive.

For a rise in the terms of trade:

This may lower inflation if raw material import prices are lower.
Depending on price elasticity of demand, it may lead to economic growth if the income earned from exports increases and a boost to employment.
It may however lead to lower economic growth if it leads to a current account deficit.

For a fall in the terms of trade:

Exports may be boosted, and this may lead to higher economic growth.
It may reduce a current account deficit.
It may however be a sign of a weak economy with exports that are less in demand and therefore lead to lower economic growth.
If imports are price inelastic, this may lead to import cost-push inflation if the economy is highly dependent on imported goods.

Evaluation should consider both price elasticity of demand for exports and imports and the dependency on international trade. N.B. reference to the Marshall-Lerner condition may be rewarded but must not be expected as that is an AL topic.
The benefits and drawbacks of both a rise in the terms of trade and a fall in the terms of trade should be carefully considered and compared to form a judgement about their impact on the wider economy.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Analysis of the concept of price elasticity of supply may explain its use in increasing a business' total sales by examining the following.

Usefulness depends on the type of goods and whether decisions need to be made in the short run or long run.
It may help businesses with regards to stock holding and decisions about which products to focus on
It may help businesses make decisions about productive capacity and whether e.g., to invest in new technology BUT
It depends on the accuracy of the data used to produce the value.
This may change over time and the value may have little value in a growing economy.
Some products, such as agricultural/perishable products, will naturally have a more price inelastic supply and knowledge of the value may have little use.

Analysis of the concept of cross elasticity of demand may explain its use in increasing a business’s total revenue by examining the following.

It will mean the business understands the relationship between its product and others i.e., whether they are complements or substitutes.
It also measures the closeness of the relationship and informs decisions about how quickly and the extent to which it should react for example if a competitor changes its prices.
It should assist a business to develop a pricing strategy that maximises opportunities to generate more sales BUT
The usefulness depends on the accuracy of the data and in a growing economy, it may not be possible to keep the value up to date. It is therefore often dependent on estimates that may be inaccurate.
Businesses may not be able to act on the data by changing prices if their cost structure cannot be easily changed.
Other variables other than cross elasticity of demand may be more important for example non price determinants such as brand loyalty.

Better answers will refer directly/implicitly to their usefulness to a business operating in a growing economy. Answers which do not are unlikely to gain more than L3 lower band.
One sided response i.e., those that only consider one concept or do not analyse the problems of at least one concept will not gain beyond L2.

PED should be easier for a firm to calculate than YED.

However, a firm will need to take into account the availability of substitutes, the amount spent on the product and the time period under consideration.
YED will be helpful in giving a firm an indication of the extent to which a change in income may affect spending on cars.
However, a firm will need to take into account whether a car is seen as a normal or an inferior good, the proportion of income that is spent on the car and whether an economy is experiencing an upturn or a downturn.

Indicative content
Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis (max 8 marks)The advantages of encouraging entrepreneurship include:

The fact that entrepreneurs are the ones who organise the other three factors of production to produce output in an economy.
They are the ones who take risks and in return receive profit which is the motivation to be successful and so stimulate economic growth.
The fact that entrepreneurs must be creative and innovative to succeed and therefore should have the skills to anticipate current and future needs to be successful and therefore increase the productive potential of an economy and thus stimulate long run economic growth e.g., as measured by a shift to the right of the PPC.
Modern economies are dynamic, ever changing and the need to respond quickly to changes is one that can be met by successful entrepreneurs.

BUT

There may be a cost in training and educating future entrepreneurs.
The rate of success of a policy to increase entrepreneurship may be low
The success depends on other factors such as the availability of government subsidies etc. which have an opportunity cost as well as the availability and quality of the other factors of production,
Because of high risks, entrepreneurs may seek short run gain which may not encourage long run economic growth and may in fact make it less likely e.g., due to rapid depletion of scarce resources.

These should be compared with the likely importance and the advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) of increasing one other factor of production i.e., land OR labour OR capital. This may include an assessment of the availability of other factors of production.

Education is classified as a merit good because it is a private good with the characteristics of being both rival and excludable; it can therefore be provided through a market because it is possible to charge a price for it, although it can also be provided by the state.
A public good is distinct from a private good because it has the characteristics of being both non-rival and non-excludable; it is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to charge a price for it due to the existence of the free rider problem; it therefore has to be provided by the state.

AO3 Evaluation

Public goods can only be provided by the state.
Merit goods will be underprovided in the free market and governments should intervene to increase provision.
However, if the demand for education is extremely low in a country, when provided through a market, a government could decide to provide it entirely through the state.

AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative contentResponses may include:AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Successful supply-side policies will cause a rightward shift in the long-run AS curve, reflecting more efficient production. This would make a country’s products more competitive in international markets and so there is likely to be an increase in net exports, correcting a deficit in the current account. Supply-side policies could include improvements in training and education, making labour markets more flexible, reductions in the powers of trade unions, an increase in competition and a reduction in rules and regulations.
Potential disadvantages of supply-side policies are that they are essentially a long-run solution and so may take a relatively long period of time to have an impact, such as improvements in training and education. Some of the policies could be quite expensive and so would involve the government in considerable expenditure, money which could have spent elsewhere (giving rise to the issue of opportunity cost).
Guidance: There are a number of alternative approaches to answering this question. At the simplest level, analysis and evaluation may focus on an assessment of the effectiveness of supply side policies only. Furthermore, this may be expanded to include a direct comparison with the effectiveness of alternative policies such as fiscal, monetary or protectionist policies. In addition, such an assessment may simply be part of evaluation. However, if supply side policies are ignored or receive scant attention then only a Level 2 mark may be awarded.
A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.
AO3 EvaluationPoints to consider may include:the cause of the deficit, the cost and ease of introducing various policies, the possible unintended consequences of introducing policies etc. leading to a justified conclusion as to whether supply-side policies would be the most effective way to correct a deficit in the current account of the balance of payments of an economy.

The positive consequences of economic growth: an improvement in the standard of living, a reduction in the rate of unemployment, an increase in incomes, an increase in the level of aggregate demand, a possible reduction in income inequality, higher tax revenues which a government could spend on improving public services (such as education and healthcare), and an increase in business confidence leading to greater investment.
The negative consequences of economic growth: a possible depletion of non-renewable natural resources and damage to the environment, such as through various types of pollution, an unequal sharing of the benefits of economic growth among a population leading to an increase in income inequality and a possible reduction in the quality of life of people through longer working hours and a reduction in the amount of leisure time, plus a shift towards more capital-intensive production. Answers may also refer to the dangers of inflationary pressure.

Consider with the help of a circular flow diagram, why an export led growth policy is likely to be successful when a developed economy is in a recession.
Export led growth is dependent on an outward growth strategy which relies heavily on openness and increased international trade. Successful growth should lead to an increase in national income, output, and employment. Concentration on the expansion of exports should be a key factor determining an increase in aggregate demand, output, and employment. This can be clearly illustrated, using a circular flow diagram which shows all withdrawals, all injections, and the change in national income equilibrium achievable via export led economic growth. This diagram should be clearly labelled and accurate showing an increase in injections (exports) producing a bigger increase in output/income/employment via the multiplier. An economy is in a recession when its GDP falls for two successive quarterly time periods. Recession will generally be accompanied by rising levels of unemployment due to a fall in aggregate monetary demand.
Government can use different economic policies to stimulate aggregate demand to move an economy out of a recession. Lower interest rates might be used to encourage investment, but this might have a limited effect due to low confidence. Government expenditure might be increased but this will depend upon the state of the public finances. When national debt is high this policy option might not be adopted. However, a policy which stimulates the growth of exports might avoid these problems and simultaneously protect the value of the domestic currency while maintaining a positive balance of payments. The effectiveness of this approach will depend upon the existing exchange rate regime used and the type of policy used, for example, lowering interest rates to depreciate a floating currency which should lead to a higher level of export growth.

The introduction of new technology will increase efficiency but will also cause an increase in unemployment.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement?
An increase in productivity will produce a more efficient outcome in an economy. An increase in productivity will be attained when there is an increase in output per unit of resource used in a given time period. This is usually measured by an increase in output per unit of labour employed in a given time period. The introduction of new technology in form of more advanced, more efficient machinery, should enable labour to increase productivity. However, this increase in productivity is often achieved by substituting capital for labour. As a result the level of unemployment will rise.
It should be noted that this is usually linked to a specific type of unemployment known as structural unemployment. There are a number of causes of unemployment for example, cyclical unemployment which are not linked to the introduction of new technology. Therefore, to some extent the statement might be correct in that structural unemployment might rise due to the substitution of capital for labour.
It is also necessary to distinguish between the short run immediate impact of the introduction of new technology. In the long run, it is possible that an increase in productivity will lead to falling prices, more consumer demand and ultimately more demand for labour. Also it is possible that the introduction of new technology will further reduce the cost of producing capital which will also lead to further increases in productivity. Further increases in productivity might then lead to a fall in the price of exported goods and a further increase in aggregate demand. In this case employment might rise in the long run.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of productivity and discussion of the link between an increase in productivity and an increase in structural unemployment.

82,Discuss the effectiveness of government policies which increase the net advantage of labour on the long–term supply of labour in an economy. [12],"a

Discuss the effectiveness of government policies which increase the net advantage of labour on the long term supply of labour in an economy.
Government policies which increase the net advantage of labour will increase the supply of labour in the long run and this can be shown by a shift downwards to the right of the supply curve of labour. This means more workers will be supplied at every wage rate. The net advantage of labour can be divided into pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements. The former might include: wages, salary and bonus payments. Non-pecuniary advantages might include: hours of work, job security, promotion prospects and nature of the work. Reductions in income tax, increasing the minimum wage and the provision of skill training could be used to increase the pecuniary element of the net advantage.
However tax reductions might lead to a fall in supply because some workers will substitute work for leisure. The provision of skill training is expensive therefore has a high opportunity cost. Minimum wage might increase the supply of labour but firm’s might lower their demand for labour and therefore create excess supply. Alternatively, a government can introduce new regulations to ensure worker’s rights such as flexible working hours, working conditions, safety at work etc. Although this extra support will benefit workers new regulations are often costly to implement. In some cases it is the firm which is expected to finance improvement in working conditions and this might lead to a fall in profitability and ultimately a fall in demand for labour
L4 (9–12 marks): For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the meaning of net advantage of labour and links this to a labour supply curve. At least one policy to increase the pecuniary element of labour supply and one policy to increase the non-pecuniary element should be analysed.

Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Answers should clearly identify and explain the key assumptions which explain the difference between these two labour markets. A monopsony market will consist of a single employer of labour; as a result the supply of labour to the firm will be upward sloping to the right. A profit maximising monopsonist employer will employ labour up to the point where the marginal cost of employing labour is equal to the marginal productivity of labour. A firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market will pay a wage determined by the market as a whole. The firm will be a wage taker and the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at the given wage.
Supporting diagrams in each case should clarify this difference. An increase in labour productivity would be reflected by an increase in the marginal physical product and therefore an increase in the marginal product of labour. In both market situations this would lead to a shift to the right of the firms MRP curve which is equivalent to an increase in the demand for labour. The impact in the case of monopsony will depend upon the extent of the increase in productivity. In a monopsony market, a significant increase in productivity will lead to a relatively higher increase in wages and employment but the extent of these changes will also be determined to some extent by the marginal cost of employing additional labour. In a perfectly competitive market, an increase in productivity will increase the demand for labour but the wage rate will remain the same.

High market concentration ratios are closely linked to Oligopoly market structures.Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm.
Some industries are dominated by a few large firms. A concentration ratio indicates the extent to which large firms might dominate an industry. For example, 4 large firms might control more than 80% of a market while a large number of small firms account for the remaining 20% of the market. In this case the four firm concentration ratio would be 80%.
Oligopolies are market structures which can be specifically identified by noting that there are only a few large firms which dominate the market i.e. they have high market concentration ratios and they also have high barriers to entry which maintains their dominant position. However, because of the nature of this type of market structure, firms have to take into account the reaction of their main rivals before adopting their pricing strategy i.e. they are interdependent. If a firm chooses to ignore the reactions of its main rivals, this could result in a price war where each firm loses potential revenue and consumers gain. As a result Oligopolies will often adopt alternative strategies to maintain/increase market share and maximise profits. Sometimes firms will collude and agree to fix a price. This is illegal but it is still used.
Alternatively, the dominant firm within the group might become the price leader and set the market price which other large firms choose to follow. Game theory and the theory of the kinked demand curve can be used to assess which strategy might be the most effective. Most of these alternative pricing strategies will lead to price rigidity. It should be noted that many Oligopoly firms will adopt non price competition such as advertising or increasing product differentiation to avoid the negative impact of price competition.

85,Limit pricing may sometimes be used by a monopoly. It creates a barrier to entry which benefits consumers in the short run but increases costs to the consumer in the long run.Discuss this statement. [13],"b

Limit pricing may sometimes be used by a monopoly. It creates a barrier to entry which benefits consumers in the short run but increases costs to the consumer in the long run.
Discuss this statement.
Monopoly firms will control the entire market or in some legal definitions, control at least 25% of the market. Barriers to entry will be used to prevent new firms entering the market and any subsequent loss of market share. It is also assumed that Monopoly firms will attempt to maximise profits and this will be achieved by letting the level of output be determined by the point where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). In some circumstances, when the market price falls to a relatively low level, it becomes possible for a new firm to enter the market and profit by charging a price which covers its costs. To prevent this, Monopoly firms might choose to lower their profit maximising but still cover costs and still maintain a satisfactory level of profits.
Monopolies can benefit from dynamic efficiency which is likely to lower average total costs compared to a new smaller firm attempting to enter the market. The new price is known as a Limit price and this can be shown with the help of a diagram which identifies a monopoly’s cost curve and a chosen limit price which is lower than the costs of the new firm. This is why limit pricing can act as a barrier to entry. On this basis it is likely that consumers will benefit in the short run due to a Monopoly firm’s decision to lower prices. However, in the long run, if the threat of entry has been removed and with it the threat to maintaining its market share, it is possible that a monopoly will then revert to its profit maximising policy. This will lead to higher prices which will have a negative impact on consumers and higher prices might now be maintained for a longer time period because the threat of competition has been removed.
Alternatively, the monopoly might invest the additional profits in research and development and achieve dynamic efficiency which will enable costs to be further reduced and low prices maintained.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of monopoly and why limit pricing might be used as a barrier to entry. The links between dynamic efficiency, low costs and the use of limit pricing as a barrier to entry should by analysed. The benefits to the consumer in the short run and potential costs in the long run should be evaluated and a conclusion provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent analysis of the relationship between a monopoly, dynamic efficiency, limit pricing and barriers to entry. Some limited comment will be made in relation to the potential difference to costs/benefits to the consumer in the short run and the long run.

86,Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12],"a

Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide.
Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.
Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.
In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear, explanation of what economists mean by a public good and its relationship to market failure. The key elements of cost benefit analysis should then be set out.

Pareto optimality can only be achieved when an economy is both productively and allocatively efficient. This will create a more equitable society. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Answers should provide a clear explanation that productive efficiency is achieved when a firm achieves minimum average total cost for a given level of output or alternatively when an economy is operating on its production possibility boundary. Allocative efficiency will be achieved when resources are allocated to ensure that the price of a unit charged to the consumer is equal to the marginal cost of producing that unit. In this case the firm will produce at an output where price (AR) = marginal cost (MC).
At a macroeconomic level, allocative efficiency will be attained when all resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction in society. This will be attained when an economy is operating at one specific point on its production possibility curve. Pareto optimality will be achieved when it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off. Any point below the production possibility curve would not be optimal because it would not fulfil this condition. Similarly an economy which is not operating at the unique allocatively efficient point on the production possibility curve would also not fulfil this condition, therefore the first part of the statement in the question is correct.
However, equity relates to an outcome where the distribution of income and/or wealth is considered to be fair. Governments can intervene, for example, through the use of re-distributive fiscal policies to produce a more equitable outcome but Pareto optimality which produces efficient outcomes will not automatically lead to a more equitable outcome. Thus the statement in the question is only partially correct.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains productive and allocative efficiency. Each type of efficiency should by analysed from a macroeconomic perspective.

A conclusion should be provided.

Explain, with the help of a diagram, explain the Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap and consider the importance of the liquidity trap to government policy makers when an economy is in a recession.
The Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap relies heavily upon the Keynesian theory of interest rate determination. This theory assumes that the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money. It is also assumed that the demand for money becomes perfectly elastic when the rate of interest on securities becomes very low and that the supply of money is perfectly inelastic because it is determined solely by the Central Bank. This can be illustrated by a supply and demand diagram. When an economy is in a recession, GDP will be falling, incomes will be low and unemployment will be relatively high.
Monetary policy such as lowering interest rates might be used to stimulate aggregate demand and move the economy out of a recession. However, according to Keynesian theory, when interest rates reach a very low level, an increase in the money supply to stimulate the economy will have no effect because this policy will have no further effect on interest rates. This form of monetary will no longer work. A diagram can support this conclusion by clearly identifying the liquidity trap. If policy makers recognise the existence of a liquidity trap, they might then choose to rely on alternative policies to move an economy out of a recession. Alternative measures might include: a devaluation of the domestic currency if is based on a fixed exchange rate; the use of expansionary fiscal policies such as increased government spending and/or tax reduction; or various supply side measures to increase productivity

The most important aim of a central bank is to control the money supply while the most important aim of a commercial (retail) bank is to maximise profits.
Discuss the extent to which these two aims can be achieved together.
Central banks have a number of important roles. One of the most important roles is the use of monetary policy to try and ensure financial stability and help a government to meet its target rate of inflation. Monetary policy would include the use of interest rate changes, exchange rate changes and controlling the money supply. The need to control the money supply is strongly linked to the relationship between the amount of money in an economy can have an important impact on the rate of inflation. Different policy instruments are available to a central bank to enable control of the money supply, these might include changes in interest rates and/or the use of open market operations.
Commercial banks are responsible for creating the largest proportion of the money supply, because banks grant loans which produce new bank deposits which automatically add to the money supply. Therefore, if a central bank increases interest rates, less borrowing from the commercial banks will take place, when bank lending falls bank deposits will fall. When this takes place, the central bank will have achieved its aim of decreasing the money supply. However, commercial bank lending is one of the main sources of commercial bank profits. On this basis one could argue that central bank policy is likely to lead to a fall in commercial bank profits. If this is true then it would seem that the two aims referred to in the statement in question are not compatible. But it could also be argued that the demand for bank loans might be interest inelastic. In this case higher interest rates are likely to lead to an increase in commercial bank profits and therefore the two aims might be compatible.

Explain what is meant by the marginal revenue product theory and consider the relationship between this theory and a trades union's ability to gain higher wages for its members.
Marginal revenue product theory is a theory which explains what determines the demand for labour. The value of an individual worker’s marginal revenue product is made up of two parts. The marginal physical product of a worker multiplied by the marginal revenue gained by the firm when the product is sold will determine the worker’s marginal revenue product. It is assumed that each firm in all labour markets are profit maximisers and will therefore employ workers up to the point where the worker’s marginal product is equal to the marginal cost of employing this extra unit of labour. In this case, either an increase in worker productivity (increase in worker MPP) or an increase in the marginal revenue gained (MR) will increase MRP. This will shift the demand curve (MRP curve) to the right and indicate an increase in the demand for labour.
The extent to which this increase in demand will enable Trades Unions to negotiate higher wages will be determined to some extent by the nature of the labour market in which they operate. In a perfectly competitive labour market analysis will focus on a situation where wage rates are determined by the supply of and the demand for labour. In this case trade unions can raise the demand for labour by increasing training and ultimately MRP.
However wages will only rise if the MRP of all labour in all firms increase. If the increase is confined to one firm, wages will not rise. In a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the marginal revenue product theory and analyses the potential impact of a Trades Union’s ability to change MRP in both a perfectly competitive labour market and an imperfect labour market.

Distinguish between economic rent and transfer earnings and with the help of diagrams discuss why famous sports people receive much higher pay than street cleaners.
Transfer earning is the minimum payment to a worker to remain in their job. Economic rent is that payment beyond that necessary to keep a factor of production in its current use. A diagram can be used to identify this difference in the labour market. Links between the elasticity of supply of labour and transfer earnings and economic rent can be further established with the help of diagrams. Famous sports people have special talents which mean that the supply of such players is limited and very inelastic. Provided there is a strong demand to watch tennis, then it is likely that famous sports people will receive very high pay. Moreover, because their particular skill is not transferable, most of a sports person's high pay will in the form of economic rent.
The supply of street cleaners is likely to be highly elastic because of the low skill levels required and the short training period necessary. Therefore, even if demand for street cleaners rose significantly, it is still unlikely that they would be able to gain a high pay rise. Also the combination of a high and elastic supply should lead to most of their pay consisting of transfer payments. It is possible for pay levels to fall for famous sports people if they fail to provide sufficient entertainment and the demand to watch an individual player falls or if there is a general decline in the demand to watch professional sports. It is also possible for pay levels of street cleaners to rise if they form part of a Trades Union or benefit from changes in government policy regarding the pay of workers in the public sector.

Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.
Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply.

101,Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure. [13],"b

Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure.
Collusion takes place when firms find that it is in their interest to co-operate with their rivals to maximise profits. Usually this will mean that firms agree together to fix output or prices or both output and price. This is known as forming a cartel. It is also known as formal collusion and is usually illegal. Sometimes an informal agreement takes place (tacit collusion). In this a dominant firm will set the price/output and other firms will then do the same. It is possible to identify specific factors which would favour collusion. These might include firms are likely to produce similar products using similar production methods; firms will be large, often with a dominant firm; there are significant barriers to entry; the market they operate in is usually stable; governments do not interfere.
Not all market structures are likely to fulfil these conditions. Firms operating in perfectly competitive markets are price takers and there are no barriers to entry. Firms operating in monopolistic competition are very small, they sell differentiated products and there are no barriers to entry. Monopoly firms, are large but by definition, do not face competition because they control all the market, so collusion would not be relevant. Oligopoly markets consist of a few large firms, which often produce similar types of goods and use barriers to entry. These factors would produce the ideal conditions to promote collusive behaviour. Therefore it is reasonable to agree with the view that collusion will only take place in an Oligopoly market.
It should be noted that although collusion can take place it does not automatically ensure that it will. Also, Oligopoly firms will still compete with each other through alternative means such as advertising and/or product differentiation. It should also be recognised that many cartel agreements break down because of cheating or one or more firms not fully sticking to the agreed rules.

Terms of trade is a measure of the relationship between export prices and import prices in an economy. By definition, a favourable movement or improvement is when export prices increase relative to a change in import prices. Import prices could fall while export prices remain unchanged.
A higher rate of inflation compared to that in trading partners will result in an increase in export prices and an improvement in the terms of trade.
A decline in the exchange rate results in a relative fall in export prices compared to trading partners. Terms of trade deteriorates.

8

A direct tax is one that is paid by individuals or businesses direct to the government. It is based on an individual’s income or on the profits of a business. Examples are income tax and profits tax. An indirect tax is so-called because it is not directly collected by the government-retailers and local government agencies are the main collectors. The tax is based on the purchase of products. Examples are GST or VAT and duties charged on sales of petrol, cigarettes and alcohol.
A direct tax is usually progressive, the rate of taxation increasing as income increases. Indirect taxes are regressive since they have to be paid irrespective of the income of the consumer.
The marginal rate of taxation is the proportion of extra income taken in tax. This will rise with a progressive tax thus increasing the burden on higher income groups. It will fall with a regressive tax thus increasing the burden on lower income groups. The average rate of tax refers to the proportion of income taken so for a progressive tax the marginal rate of taxation will be higher than the average rate of taxation and lower for a regressive tax.

12

An increase in direct taxes is likely to lead to a fall in AD and therefore inflation due to a fall in consumption and investment. It is likely to be easy to implement and may be seen as fair if the tax is progressive as the burden will fall more on higher income groups. However, it may reduce incentives and lead to lower economic growth.
An increase in interest rates should lead to an increase in savings and a fall in consumption and investment due to the increase in borrowing. The effects are likely to be quicker than an increase in direct taxes due to the speed of implementation. However, it may have similar consequences to an increase in direct taxes and it may be ineffective if interest rates are already very low, or confidence levels remain high.
Both evaluation and analysis may make reference to the fact that effectiveness of both methods depends on the type of inflation i,e., if it is costpush rather than demand -pull, they may be ineffective..

The purpose of maximum price legislation is to ensure that consumers get access to supplies of essential products such as various types of food and in some cases, water and power supplies. It may also free up income to purchase other essential items. To be effective the maximum price must be below the equilibrium price in a free market, and this may be referred to in the first part of the analysis. An accurate diagram should not be expected but would enhance the quality of the analysis.
However, the problem with a maximum price is that demand invariably exceeds supply at this price. Shortages can occur and this can lead to an informal market and profiteering along with rationing and queuing. Consumers may end up paying even more than the equilibrium price to get the supplies they need.

Potential limitations of protectionist policies:

tariffs may not be very effective if the demand for the imported products is relatively price inelastic
some quotas may not be that restrictive

Definition of PED: the measurement of the extent to which a change in price leads to a change in quantity demanded
Formula of PED: percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product divided by the percentage change in the price of a product.
Factors affecting PED:

the availability and price of substitutes: the market contains many firms and so PED for a particular brand of car is likely to be relatively elastic
the price of the product relative to income: the higher the relative proportion of income accounted for by a particular brand of car, the more elastic the PED is likely to be, although this could change over time as incomes rise
loyalty: if consumers have a strong loyalty to a particular brand of car, this will tend to make PED relatively inelastic
need or want: the degree to which a particular brand of car is seen as a necessity or a luxury
the time period: the PED for any particular brand of car is likely to increase over time, so it is more likely to be relatively elastic in the LR than in the SR

Explain what is meant by a transmissions mechanism of monetary policy and consider why it might not work in practice.
Monetary transmissions mechanisms attempt to explain how changes in monetary policy might have an impact on key macroeconomic goals such as national income, output, employment and inflation.
Answers may explain either the Keynesian model or an alternative model based on a central bank changing the base rate of interest. Keynes suggested that an increase in the money supply might affect real variables such as output and employment because this would be transmitted by a fall in interest rates, leading to a rise in investment/aggregate monetary demand and ultimately an increase in GDP and employment. However, Keynes also identified a number of reasons why this approach might not work effectively in practice. Reasons might include: the existence of a liquidity trap; an interest inelastic investment; a relatively low multiplier effect; negative effect of a rise in income on interest rates.
A similar approach might be adopted in relation to the use of a central bank’s mechanism to change interest rates to control the rate of inflation. Again, the success of this approach will rely heavily upon the strength of the links between a change in monetary policy and each of the variables which will determine the final outcome.
L4 (9–12 marks): For either approach an explanation of the meaning of monetary transmissions mechanism is required and supporting analysis should be fully developed and critically evaluated. In either approach, at least two evaluative comments should be provided. A reasoned conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the chosen monetary transmissions mechanism might work in practice.

129,Discuss the role and importance of the commercial banks in a developed economy. [13],"b

Discuss the role and importance of the commercial banks in a developed economy.
Key roles associated with commercial banks include: to allow the safekeeping of funds; to provide loans to consumers and producers; to act as financial intermediaries and make it easier for payments to be made within and between persons and firms.
Each of these roles can be linked to growth and development in a developed economy. Savings can be used to allow firms to borrow for investment purposes thus promoting long term economic growth. Loans can be also provided to consumers to promote an increase in consumer expenditure, increased aggregate demand and an increase in output and employment. Financial intermediation and easier methods of payment should promote specialisation and exchange thus further encouraging economic growth.
However it should also be noted that profitably is one of the main aims of a commercial bank and in some circumstances it is not clear that the needs of would- be investors are not consistent with the aims of a commercial bank. Banks have to maintain liquidity and security as well as profitability. Hence much needed loans to the private sector are not always available. In addition commercial bank loans create new bank deposits which automatically increase the money supply in an economy. In some situations this does not help a government to maintain an appropriate monetary policy. For example, a rapid increase in bank lending would be unwise when an economy is experiencing rising rates of inflation. A conclusion should summarise the preceding discussion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a description of three key functions of a commercial bank. Responses should then discuss the importance of at least two of these roles in relation to a developed economy.

Discuss the costs and benefits of a trade union intervening to influence the wages of workers in a specific occupation
The main benefits associated with Trade Union intervention in the labour market would include: high wages due to collective bargaining; maintenance/improvement of working conditions and the maintenance of job security. The extent to which these objectives will be determined to some extent by the nature of the labour market in which they operate. In a perfectly competitive labour market analysis will focus on a situation where wage rates are determined by the supply of and the demand for labour. In this case trade unions can raise wages without loss of jobs, by increasing training and ultimately MRP. However, if wage increases are obtained by collective bargaining, which establishes a higher minimum wage, this might be achieved at a cost of significant job losses.
Similarly, in a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer. The loss of jobs and job security is likely to be the most significant cost in both cases. A conclusion should attempt to judge alternative situations where a net benefit/cost might arise.

The introduction of a national minimum wage by a government will always benefit employees at the expense of employers.
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement
Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to introduce a minimum wage. Aims might include: to protect basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage imposed above the existing market equilibrium. This analysis can then be linked to the specific statement in the question by considering why the effect of an increase in wages will be different, depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case. ‘always’ is a key word in the statement and it is assumed that candidates will question whether this is acceptable. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit the employer as well as the employee. Also references to possible positive/negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, higher minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living. A conclusion should attempt to address the specific question based on preceding analysis.
L4 (9–13 marks): At least 2 factors should be identified which support the assertion that employees will benefit from the imposition of a minimum wage. These benefits should be discussed using appropriate analysis. The extent to which these benefits are then attained at the expense of employers should then be fully discussed, referring to different types of labour market etc. A conclusion should attempt to make a judgement relating to whether the attained benefits are always gained at the expense of the employers.

Firms in perfect competition and firms in monopolistic competition will only achieve normal profits in the long run. This means that firms in both these types of market structure are equally efficient.
Discuss, with the help of diagrams, the extent to which you agree with this statement.
The main types of efficiency will be explained including: allocative efficiency, productive efficiency and possibly dynamic efficiency. Reference to the long run position in perfect competition in combination with definitions of efficiency should allow that firms in perfect competition will achieve both allocative and productive efficiency in the long run. Similarly, reference to a long run position in monopolistic competition using the same definitions of efficiency should enable candidates to conclude that a firm in monopolistic competition will not be allocatively efficient i.e. will not produce where AR=MC and it will not produce at the minimum point of its long run average total cost curve. Therefore it will not operate at an optimum level of output.
Answers which point out that the firm in monopolistic competition will be operating at a productively efficient level of output in the long run are acceptable provided it is clear that the definition of productive efficiency is stated as 'the minimum unit cost attainable for a given level of output'. A conclusion would point out that a perfectly competitive firm is therefore likely to be more efficient than it monopolistically competitive counterpart. Good responses might refer to dynamic efficiency and given the small size of firms in both types of market structure, neither firm would be able to benefit from this type of efficiency.

Interdependence is a key characteristic of oligopoly firms. This creates a problem regarding the pricing decisions made by such firms.
Explain this statement and discuss the extent to which game theory can help to solve this problem.
Answers should explain what economists mean by ‘interdependence’ in relation to an Oligopoly market structure. Oligopolies will be large firms with a high concentration ratio. This means that the pricing and output decisions of any one of these firms is likely to have a significant impact on profits, market share and growth of their main competitors.
One example might be illustrated by reference to the kinked demand curve and the link between price changes and changes in total revenue. This also emphasises the need to avoid price wars where all firms risk a fall in profits while the consumer benefits.
Game theory, which uses the idea of a maxi-min strategy and refers to the ‘Prisoners Dilemma’ as an example, can be used by an Oligopoly firm to promote the idea of collusion to choose a price which will maximise revenue. There are alternatives to this approach. For example, the market price may be set by the dominant firm while the remaining firms follow.
Tacit collusion might take place where the market price is set by ’rules of thumb’ such as average cost pricing. Thus although Game theory is undoubtedly useful to Oligopoly firms, there are a number of alternative approaches which might also be successfully adopted.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a response which explains the concept of interdependence in relation to the specific market structure of Oligopoly. The kinked demand curve should be used to illustrate the pricing problem. A clear analysis of the use of Game theory should be used to discuss a potential solution to this problem. At least one alternative pricing approach should be discussed. A conclusion should provide a judgement upon the specific statement under discussion.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent analysis of the importance of interdependence in relation to Oligopoly pricing, which incorporates the theory of the kinked demand curve and identifies why this constitutes a problem. An attempt might be made to explain Game theory but this will not be clearly identified as a solution to the specific problem. There will be no attempt to consider whether Game theory might represent the only solution.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a brief, descriptive approach which refers to interdependence and the kinked demand curve or interdependence and Game theory but does not attempt to link the three concepts to address the specific question

Explain what economists mean by a public good and discuss why the provision of such a good is associated with market failure.
Answers should provide a clear explanation of the meaning of a public good. Key characteristics: non rival; non excludable should be identified. Some reference to non- divisible/non-rejectable might also be referred to. Examples provided might include: street lighting/national defence/lighthouse
The link between the characteristics of a public good and the difficulty associated with the provision of such a good by the free market should be established i.e. the ‘free rider problem’ Market failure should be discussed in the context of allocative inefficiency. Allocative efficiency is attained when resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction. If public goods are not provided, consumer satisfaction is unlikely to be maximised, hence unless the State provides public goods, market failure will occur.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains the key characteristics of a public good and analyses the links between allocative efficiency and the concept of market failure.

Discuss the extent to which monopoly producers and the consumers of their products might benefit from the existence of barriers to entry.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the state might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Potential benefits to the monopolist might include: higher profits; increase in efficiency; increase in market share; growth of the firm. The consumer benefits might include: lower prices; higher quality product; greater availability of a product.
Responses might refer to a range of alternative barriers to entry including: economies of scale; branding/advertising; legal requirements/patents; natural monopolies; limit pricing. Good responses will choose at least two types of barrier and discuss how each might have a positive/negative effect on both the producer and the consumer. For example, economies of scale might increase Monopoly profits by lowering unit costs but also benefit the consumer by possible subsequent price reductions. Similarly, the use of limit pricing to prevent new entrants might lower prices for the consumer in the short run but lead to a higher market share and higher profits in the long run.
On a more general note, some barriers might allow a monopolist to maintain profits in the long run and invest in research and development thus achieving dynamic efficiency. These benefits might by be passed on to the consumer through lower prices, higher quality products and more choice. Alternatively, barriers might lead to complacency and X inefficiency which is likely to lead to higher prices and lower quality products.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a clear, explanation of two barriers to entry and a discussion of how each of the barriers might have both a negative and positive effect on the producer and the consumer.

For application that explains what is meant by demand pull inflation (1 mark) an appropriate example of a cause (1 mark) duly explained why this is different to cost push inflation (1 mark)

Cost-push inflation is the outcome of a rise in the costs of production. This results in a shift to the left of the AS curve, increasing the price level. Possible causes could be an increase in wages above the rate of inflation, an increase in raw material costs or an increase in the price of fuel imports due to the depreciation of the currency
Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in aggregate demand not matched by an increase in aggregate supply. This will have a strong effect if the economy is at or close to the level of full employment. The cause could be an increase in government spending, a reduction in taxation leading to a consumer boom or an increase in demand for exports following a depreciation of the currency.

12

Monetary policy involves measures that influence the price or quantity of money. These include interest rates and the money supply. In some countries exchange rate policy is included. Interest rate changes though have tended to be the main policy used to control the rate of inflation in most countries. In theory, an increase in the rate of interest should encourage more saving by consumers and less funding for investment by businesses. If effective, an increase in interest rates should reduce the rate of inflation.
Fiscal policy can also be used. This involves increasing taxation or reducing government spending to reduce inflation. Both measures are at the cost of increasing the level of unemployment. Supply side policies are also possible, especially if there are structural weaknesses in an economy.

12

Merit goods have positive side effects when consumed. They are provided because of information failure which can lead to under consumption and under production. Consumers of things like education and healthcare do not perceive the true benefits usually because they do not have either any information or true information. Therefore, the government often provides merit goods.
Merit goods in many countries are provided by the private sector as well as the public sector. This is often because the cost of provision to the public sector is too great or because the cost cannot be met in full. The case of healthcare is important in most low and middleincome countries.

Potential difficulties for a country:

a government will need to have sufficient reserves to intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the rate of the currency

The incidence of a tax:

the incidence of a tax refers to the extent to which the burden of a tax is borne by the producer and the consumer
this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for the product
depends on the elasticity of the supply curve.

The producer:

if the demand for the product is relatively price elastic, then the producer will have to pay a greater part of the tax

The consumer:

if the demand for the product is relatively price inelastic, then the consumer will have to pay a greater part of the tax

Necessities and substitutes:

the degree to which a manufactured product is a necessity with few substitutes will influence the PED for the product.
in this situation, the PED for the product is likely to be relatively price inelastic

Consider, with the help of a circular flow diagram, the potential impact of a fall in the rate of interest on the level of output and the level of employment.
Candidates should produce an accurate, clearly labelled, three sector circular flow diagram. Injections and withdrawals should be clearly identified. The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained. Also the links between expenditure, output and employment should be explained. The full employment level of income, expenditure and output should be labelled on the diagram. Analysis should then examine the potential impact of a fall in the rate of interest on withdrawals. For example, savings and imports, or injections for example, investment and exports. The extent of the potential impact should be discussed in each case. For example, a fall in interest rates is likely to reduce the level of savings and increase the level of consumer spending. This will produce higher levels of expenditure, output and employment.
However, the overall impact will also be affected by any subsequent change in the multiplier effect. If the marginal propensity to save falls significantly, the multiplier will increase and the overall impact on output and employment will be substantial. The impact on investment (injection) will also depend upon factors such as the interest elasticity of investment and/or the current level of confidence of potential investors. Reference might be made to the importance of locating the current state of the economy before the fall in the rate of interest takes place. If there is a lot of existing spare capacity, the impact of a fall in interest rates on output and employment is likely to be significant.
L4 (9–12 marks) for an answer which uses circular flow theory to analyse the relationship between expenditure, income, output and employment. Analysis should be supported by an appropriate diagram. The impact of a fall in the rate of interest should be considered in relation to at least one withdrawal and one injection. Some evaluative comment should be provided in each case. A conclusion should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks) for analysis which explains the circular flow model and identifies withdrawals and injections. Full employment equilibrium will also be identified. Analysis will focus upon either one withdrawal or one injection but it should be supported by a diagram and at least one evaluative comment.

There will be no evidence of analysis which examines the impact of a fall in the rate of interest on either withdrawals or injections. Diagrams might not be accurately labelled.

Discuss whether there is likely to be a conflict when a government attempts to fix exchange rates while at the same time introducing policies to decrease the level of inflation.
Governments can adopt a fixed exchange rate policy and maintain a fixed exchange rate in conjunction with direct intervention by a central bank in the foreign exchange market. If there is downward pressure on the external value of the domestic currency due to a balance of payments deficit, the central bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market by using its reserves of foreign currency to purchase domestic currency. This will prevent the fall in external value of the domestic currency. If the balance of payments is in surplus, the central bank will sell domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. If a government makes a formal announcement that it is going to fix the exchange rate at a lower rate, this is a de-valuation. Attempts to fix the currency at a higher rate would constitute a re-valuation. When exchange rates are fixed, the main instruments of monetary policy would be changes in interest rates and/or changes in the money supply.
However, if interest rates are raised to reduce aggregate monetary demand, to reduce the level of inflation, this will produce short term capital inflows which will put upward pressure on the domestic currency. To maintain the fixed exchange rate the central bank will sell the domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. This will increase the money supply which is likely to then make it more difficult to reduce the level of inflation. Thus it is likely that there will be a conflict when a government attempts to fix exchange rates and control inflation at the same time. Alternative approaches may use supply side policies which might reduce inflation without having a significant impact on the balance of payments. Although it is possible that such policies might still make exports more competitive and therefore still create problems maintaining fixed exchange rates.
L4 (9–13 marks) for a clear explanation of what is meant by fixed exchange rates and the process which is used by a government and central bank to achieve fixed rates. Alternative monetary policies used to reduce inflation should be explained. Analysis should then establish the link between antiinflationary policies and exchange rates which should also clearly identify why there might be potential conflict. A conclusion might consider possible approaches which might avoid the negative effects of this conflict.

A link should be established between a fixed exchange rate policy and the success/failure of monetary policy but the analysis will not be full developed and there will be no attempt to consider possible solutions to this conflict.

A profit maximising firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market might decide to increase the number of workers it employs but it will not choose to increase its workers' wage rates.
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Key assumptions which underpin the theory of a perfectly competitive labour market should include: homogeneous labour; perfect mobility of labour, no barriers to entry, firms are wage takers; perfect knowledge. A profit maximising firm operating in this market will employ labour up to the point where the marginal product of labour is equal to the wage paid to labour. An explanation of the link between MRP and the demand for labour should be provided. It should also be noted that the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at a wage determined by the market forces of supply of and demand for labour. If the productivity of workers within the firm increases or the price received by this firm increase, then the demand for labour will rise and more workers will be employed.
However, the wage rate will not change. If a firm in perfect competition allowed an increase in its worker's wages it would no longer maximise profits at the new level of output. Therefore this would support the statement in the question. Similarly, if a firm in a perfectly competitive labour market decided to raise wages with an increase in MRP, profits would only be maximised if the level of employment fell. It should be recognised in a conclusion that both wages and employment could rise at the same time if any of the conditions which determine market demand or market supply change. In this case each firm will receive a perfectly elastic supply of labour at a higher wage rate.
L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound discussion that explains what is meant by a perfectly competitive labour market and how the profit maximising level of employment will be determined based on the supply of and demand for labour by the firm. Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the statement in the question might be true. A conclusion should refer to and consider the relationship between the labour market and the supply of labour to each firm.

The government of a country sets an effective national minimum wage for workers.
Discuss the arguments for and against the government's decision.
Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to increase the minimum wage. Aims might include: to increase basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage, which will be different depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case. Potential benefits to the macro economy might be discussed. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit employers and the economy as a whole.
However, depending upon the type of market, referred to above, such a minimum wage might lead to significant job losses. Also, this policy might lead to a significant increase in government expenditure which might have to be financed by higher levels of taxation. Additional references to possible negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, a minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living. A conclusion should attempt to address the specific question based on preceding analysis.
L4 (9–13 marks) Factors should be identified that support a government’s decision to set a national minimum wage and factors that refer to the potential cost associated with such a decision.

A conclusion should be provided which attempts to summarize the arguments for and against.

158,Explain what economists mean by indifference curves and budget lines and evaluate whether they might be used together to support rational consumer decision making. [12],"a

Explain what economists mean by indifference curves and budget lines and evaluate whether they might be used together to support rational consumer decision making.
Indifference curves describe all the combinations of two goods which when consumed will give an equal level of consumer satisfaction. This is why consumers are indifferent regarding which point on the curve they might attain. Typical indifference curves will be convex to the origin and downward sloping from left to right. Budget lines establish all the combinations of two goods which can be purchased given the price of each good and subject to an income constraint. This will be a straight line, sloping downwards from left to right.
A consumer will be considered to be in equilibrium when maximum consumer satisfaction is attained. This is when the consumer is able to reach a point on the furthest indifference curve from the origin while spending all their available income. On a diagram it is where the consumer budget line is at a tangent with this indifference curve. It is important to note that this point can only be attained by rational consumer decision making. This assumes: consumers always want to maximise satisfaction, that consumers can measure the total satisfaction obtained when consuming a combination of goods and that no external influences, for example advertising, might lead to irrational decision making.
L4 (9–12 marks) for a clear explanation of the concept of an indifference curve and a budget line. This might be supported by the use of clearly labelled accurate diagrams. Rational consumer decision making can then be explained either verbally or by combination of description plus diagrams. Evaluative comments should be provided and discussed.

Use indifference theory to analyse the view that the demand for an inferior good is likely to be more price inelastic than the demand for a normal good.
Candidates should recognise the assumptions which underpin indifference theory and how these assumptions relate to consumer desire to maximise satisfaction by buying a combination of goods which is consistent with consumer equilibrium. Explanation of a normal good should be provided. Analysis should then attempt to explain the impact of a change in price. This effect can be divided into a substitution effect and an income effect. Further price changes can then be used to construct the relationship between a change in price and a subsequent change in demand. This can be done using verbal description or by the use of accurately labelled diagrams plus relevant description. The link between indifference analysis, price change, a normal good and the shape of the demand curve should be clearly established.
A similar approach can be used i.e. using the relative impact of the substitution effect and income effect, to show the link between a price change, an inferior good and the shape of the demand curve. The overall effect on the elasticity of demand for each type of good should then be made by discussing the impact of the negative effect on the elasticity of demand for the inferior good. Verbal description and/or description plus diagrams would be acceptable. A conclusion should refer to the extent to which the view in question might be correct.

Explain what is meant by dynamic efficiency and consider which type of market structure is most likely to achieve dynamic efficiency.
Answers should provide a clear explanation of the meaning of dynamic efficiency which refers to the use of profits to re-invest in research and development to reduce long run average total costs. The effect on a firm’s long run average total cost curve should be clearly explained. And existing average total cost will move entirely in a downwards direction, showing that as a result of investment, the firm has now reduced its average total cost curve at every level of output.
There are four types of market structure. Firms operating in a perfectly competitive market and firms operating in a monopolistically competitive market are unlikely to be able to achieve dynamic efficiency. This is primarily due to both types of market consisting of small firms which make it very difficult to gain sufficient profits to enable investment in research and development.
However, monopoly and oligopoly firms are likely to be large and be able to generate sufficient profits to benefit from investment in research and development and gain dynamic efficiency. It is more likely that a monopoly will generate sufficient profits because they will have full market control whereas an oligopoly might need to use profits to use non price competition to maintain their market share. Although it should also be recognised that some monopolies might simply use profits to increase shareholder dividends or dynamic efficiency might not be achieved due to X inefficiency.

The use of cars in large cities can cause traffic congestion and pollution.
Explain how the use of cars may cause allocative inefficiency and discuss two alternative government policies that might be used to solve this problem.
Allocative inefficiency occurs when a good/service is over/under produced which prevents an outcome which will maximize consumer satisfaction. Motor cars can cause traffic congestion and pollution which both contribute towards producing an allocatively inefficient outcome. Congestion is associated with slower transport/distribution and this causes inefficiency. Pollution produces negative externalities which are additional costs which are not incurred by the user of motor cars but which have to be borne by society in general. When these additional costs are not taken into account, more motor cars are produced, sold and used than would otherwise be the case, therefore allocative efficiency in relation to the amount of resources used to produce cars is not achieved.
There are a number of alternative government policies which can be used to address the overproduction of cars. Policies might include: taxation, legislation, regulation, advertising, subsidising alternative methods of transport. Each policy can be evaluated. For example, subsidising alternative forms of transport might be costly and the cross elasticity of demand for motor cars and alternative forms of transport might be very low.
L4 (9–13 marks) for a clear, explanation of allocative efficiency and the link between motor car use, traffic congestion, pollution, negative externalities and allocative inefficiency.

How far economic growth will decrease unemployment should be discussed by linking growth to output, income and employment. Candidates might also question whether economic growth will always reduce unemployment. For example, new technology might lead to increase in output via increases in productivity, at the expense of jobs. The second part of the question requires candidates to discuss possible conflicts between attaining economic growth, controlling inflation and reducing balance of payments deficits.L4 (9–13 marks): for an answer that discusses the possibility that in certain circumstances, economic growth might not decrease the level of unemployment and provides supporting examples. At least two potential problems relating to the attainment of other macroeconomic goals should be discussed. L3 (7–8 marks): for an answer that analyses the relationship between a growth in output and a subsequent increase in employment. Diagrams might be used to support the analysis. At least one potential problem relating to the attainment of other macroeconomic goals should be identified. L2 (5–6 marks): for an answer that describes why economic growth might create jobs and makes some attempt to explain why other macroeconomic goals might be affected. L1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Keynes argued that the rate of interest will not ensure that the level of savings will equal the level of investment in an economy because savings and investment are undertaken by different individuals for different reasons. Explain this statement and discuss how far you would support this view. Responses should explain the traditional theory of the relationship between interest rates and savings/ investment. If there was a surplus/deficit in relation to savings and investment, it was assumed that interest rate adjustment would ensure that these two would return to equilibrium. Keynes argued that savings were more likely to be determined by the level of individual's income and investment was more likely to be determined by investor confidence. Hence, there was no reason to support the view that interest rates will return to equilibrium based on changes in interest rates.L4 (9–13 marks): for responses that makes an attempt to assess how far they would support this Keynesian position.

The monetarist explanation of the use of this equation to explain the cause of inflation should be discussed and the key assumptions necessary to support this theory should be identified. It is important to recognise the monetarist approach which assumes that V and T are constant/stable. Based on this formula and assumptions, the theory predicts a direct relation between changes in the money supply and changes in inflation. However, the predictions of the theory are not always borne out in practice. In practice it could be argued that: it is very difficult to identify a precise measure of the money supply; the velocity of circulation is not always constant; T is the full employment level of output which also not always the case; sometimes it is changes in the demand for money which cause changes in the money supply, this undermines the basic premise of the theory. A conclusion should be provided based on the preceding argument. L4 (9–12 marks): For a sound explanation of the Quantity Theory of Money which identifies the relevant equation and explains the component parts.

Different approaches might be adopted to determine whether the control of inflation is the most important. One approach might examine the impact of the failure to control inflation on the other macroeconomic goals. For example, a high rate of inflation might lead to reduction in investment and ultimately a reduction in economic growth. At the same time high inflation will make exports more expensive this would have a negative effect on the balance of payments, the exchange rate and the level of employment.

188,Explain what economists mean by the marginal propensity to consume and consider the importance of this concept in relation to government macroeconomic policy. [12],"a
Explain what economists mean by the marginal propensity to consume and consider the importance of this concept in relation to government macroeconomic policy.An individual's marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the proportion of any additional income received by the individual which is spent on consumption. Basic Keynesian economic theory assumes that the marginal propensity to consume remains constant regardless of the level of an individual's level of income. It is more realistic to assume that the marginal propensity to consume will fall as individual income increases. Government macroeconomic policy focuses on key goals, including: high employment; high growth; low/stable inflation; stable balance of payments/exchange rate; re-distributing income. It is possible to link the concept of marginal propensity to consume to each of these key goals. For example, a government may increase expenditure to increase aggregate demand to increase output and employment. The ultimate impact of this additional expenditure will be determined by the multiplier effect which in turn, will be determined by the value of the marginal propensity to consume. Also, due to this multiplier effect, some of the subsequent further increase in income might be spent on purchasing imports and this is likely to have a negative impact on the balance of payments.L4 (9–12 marks): For a response which clearly explains the concept of the marginal propensity to consume. An attempt should be made to analyse the importance of the MPC in relation to the use of government policy to achieve at least three macroeconomic goals.

Explain the factors which determine the elasticity of demand for labour and discuss the importance of the elasticity of demand for labour in relation to the effectiveness of a government's minimum wage policy. Responses should identify and explain some key factors which might determine the elasticity of demand for labour. Candidates might refer to: the proportion of labour costs in relation to a firm's total cost; the ease with which labour can be substituted by capital; the elasticity of the demand for the product produced; the time period under consideration. An attempt should then be made to link these factors in relation to a government’s minimum wage policy. For example, labour operating in a monopolistically competitive market is likely to be producing a product which has an elastic demand. This means that if the imposition of a minimum wage leads to higher prices, there will be a significant decrease in the demand for the product and subsequently, a significant rise in unemployment. This suggests that a government minimum wage policy will have a substantially negative effect on the labour market. A similar approach might be adopted in relation to other factors referred to above. A conclusion should comment that the effectiveness of policy will depend upon the factor under consideration but also other factors should be taken into account, for example, the elasticity of supply of labour.L4 (9 ̶ 12 marks): For a clear explanation and analysis of at least two factors which might determine the elasticity of the demand for labour.

Candidates might discuss how a trade union can help to correct market failure caused by monopsonist employers, through collective bargaining. Good responses will also recognise that trade unions can also cause market failure. For example by negotiating a minimum wage above the competitive market equilibrium wage rate or by restricting labour supply through the use of closed shop agreements. Based on the preceding analysis an attempt to assess the validity of the view in the question should then be made. L4 (9–13 marks): For analysis which addresses both parts of the question. A clear attempt to evaluate the accuracy of the view under consideration should be demonstrated by comparing the type of market failure associated with monopsony with that of a trade union and recognising that in some circumstances, a trade union might help to correct market failure, while in other circumstances this might not be the case. This should be reflected by a conclusion which attempts to assess the validity of the view in question. L3 (7– 8 marks): For an accurate reference to the question and clear analysis explaining the relationship between monopsony and market failure and also trade unions and market failure but with a more limited evaluation or limited attempt to discuss the validity of the view under consideration.L2 (5– 6 marks): For a briefer analysis that examines two causes of labour market failure but does not use these differences to discuss the validity of the view under consideration.L1 (1– 4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

12
There are various policies for controlling a rising rate of inflation, one of which is increasing interest rates. This policy is expected to reduce consumption and investment by firms whilst increasing savings. The effectiveness though depends upon the rate of inflation and the time it takes for increased interest rates to have an impact.

Maximum price legislation is imposed to keep the price of food low so that those on low incomes can afford to buy food. The impact, however, is to reduce the supply of food and create excess demand. Informal markets and queuing are likely to follow, and rationing might be necessary Food subsidies will reduce the price of food and increase the supply of food, but the impact depends upon the elasticity of demand of food. The effects might only be felt in the long term. The low prices might encourage hoarding of food.

218,Explain and critically evaluate the quantity theory of money. [12],"a
Explain and critically evaluate the quantity theory of money. The quantity theory of money is based on the assumption that there is a direct relationship between a change in the money supply and the rate of inflation. The theory uses the equation MV= PT. This assumes that V is constant and T is constant (i.e. consistent with the full employment level of transactions). On this basis, any change in M (the money supply) will have a direct effect on P (the price level). Critics question both of these assumptions and also point out that it is extremely difficult to measure the money supply and also difficult to effectively control the money supply.  L4 (9–12 marks) For a clear explanation of the quantity theory of money and the assumptions upon which this theory is based. At least two critical evaluation points should be raised which question the assumptions and the ability to measure/control some of the variables in the equation.  L3 (7–8 marks) For detailed analysis of the quantity theory and how it is supposed to work in practice. This should be supported by some critical comment based on the assumptions of the theory.  L2 (5–6 marks) For some knowledge of the quantity theory of money and how it might be used to support the monetarist explanation of the cause of inflation. Key assumptions relating to this theory might not be considered and critical comment will be brief and undeveloped.  L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Monetary policy relies heavily on the theory of a monetary transmission mechanism.  Explain how a monetary transmission mechanism works and discuss its effectiveness.  The monetary transmissions mechanism links changes in the money market to changes in the goods market. Changes in the money supply will change interest rates which will impact on the level of investment and ultimately this will change real variables such as output and employment. Evaluative comment might refer to the liquidity trap, an inelastic MEC curve, the effect of negative expectations on investment, a possible weak multiplier effect or the negative feedback effect of an increase in income on the rate of interest.L4 (9–13 marks) For a detailed explanation of the Keynesian monetary transmission supported by an accurate, clearly labelled diagram.

Distinguish between a country’s national debt and its public sector budget deficit and consider which is the more important.Candidates should clearly distinguish between the national debt and the public sector budget deficit. The national is the cumulative amount of debt which consists of the total amount of money borrowed from the private sector and other purchases of government securities since the government began borrowing. The public sector budget deficit occurs when a government spends more than its income in a particular time period, usually one year. Both are important due to their potential effects on the macro economy. Interest has to be paid on the national debt and this has an opportunity cost regarding the use of scarce public sector resources. The budget deficit has to be financed and this has important implications for the impact of this on key macroeconomic indicators. L4 (9–12 marks) For an answer that provides a clear explanation of both terms and why each is important in relation to macroeconomic policy. An attempt should be made to evaluate the relative importance of each indicator and also an attempt should be made to show how both elements are linked. A conclusion should provide evidence of some consideration of why one indicator may or may not be more important than the other.  L3 (7–8 marks) For responses that demonstrate a good grasp of both indicators and why both indicators are important by linking each to macroeconomic management.

The equilibrium change involves substitution and income effects. Substitution effect would be in the opposite direction to the price change. The income effect is represented by a parallel shift of the budget line is in the same direction as the substitution effect for the normal good but in the opposite direction for an inferior and Giffen good.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.

A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.

Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.

Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

The effect of direct provision of goods and services by the government: • does it prevent the price mechanism from rationing? • does it prevent the price mechanism from signalling? • does it prevent the price mechanism from transmitting preferences? The direct provision of goods and services by the government will be financed through the tax system, e.g. education and health care, and so will not be allocated through a price mechanism. However, education and health care can also be provided through a price mechanism and in this situation the mechanism can function as a rationing and signalling device and as a way of transmitting preferences

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

A decrease in the price of a product will increase the consumer surplus as more consumers are willing to pay the lower price. The extent of this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for a product. In the case of a luxury product with many substitutes, PED will be elastic. In the case of an essential product with few substitutes, PED will be inelastic.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.

Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

The effect of direct provision of goods and services by the government: • does it prevent the price mechanism from rationing? • does it prevent the price mechanism from signalling? • does it prevent the price mechanism from transmitting preferences? The direct provision of goods and services by the government will be financed through the tax system, e.g. education and health care, and so will not be allocated through a price mechanism. However, education and health care can also be provided through a price mechanism and in this situation the mechanism can function as a rationing and signalling device and as a way of transmitting preferences

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

A decrease in the price of a product will increase the consumer surplus as more consumers are willing to pay the lower price. The extent of this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for a product. In the case of a luxury product with many substitutes, PED will be elastic. In the case of an essential product with few substitutes, PED will be inelastic.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.

Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

The effect of direct provision of goods and services by the government: • does it prevent the price mechanism from rationing? • does it prevent the price mechanism from signalling? • does it prevent the price mechanism from transmitting preferences? The direct provision of goods and services by the government will be financed through the tax system, e.g. education and health care, and so will not be allocated through a price mechanism. However, education and health care can also be provided through a price mechanism and in this situation the mechanism can function as a rationing and signalling device and as a way of transmitting preferences

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

A decrease in the price of a product will increase the consumer surplus as more consumers are willing to pay the lower price. The extent of this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for a product. In the case of a luxury product with many substitutes, PED will be elastic. In the case of an essential product with few substitutes, PED will be inelastic.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a competent comment with the emphasis on describing alternative macroeconomic goals. Some limited explanation will be provided but there will be no attempt to examine the links between these goals. There will be no attempt to discuss the validity of the view.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.

Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.

The effect of direct provision of goods and services by the government: • does it prevent the price mechanism from rationing? • does it prevent the price mechanism from signalling? • does it prevent the price mechanism from transmitting preferences? The direct provision of goods and services by the government will be financed through the tax system, e.g. education and health care, and so will not be allocated through a price mechanism. However, education and health care can also be provided through a price mechanism and in this situation the mechanism can function as a rationing and signalling device and as a way of transmitting preferences

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

A decrease in the price of a product will increase the consumer surplus as more consumers are willing to pay the lower price. The extent of this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for a product. In the case of a luxury product with many substitutes, PED will be elastic. In the case of an essential product with few substitutes, PED will be inelastic.

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.

Marshall’s utility requires a precise calculation of marginal utility, and by relating MU to price, has a direct link to the construction of a demand curve. Indifference curve theory shows different quantities of two goods bought as either income or price changes; changes in amounts bought can be split into income and substitution effects and different types of goods more readily distinguished than with Marshall’s theory. However there is no direct link to a complete demand curve which shows demand against price. The analysis does not require an absolute ‘cardinal’ measurement of utility in ‘utils’ but it still requires a measurement satisfaction which in reality is unrealistic.L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound explanation of the analysis and a clear understanding of the principles involved with an accurate comment on the differences between the two approaches in the link to demand curves.

A rise in the terms of trade means that a given quantity of exports can purchase a greater quantity of imports and the opposite is true for a fall in the terms of trade.

794,Explain how the factor of production enterprise contributes to aggregate supply in a modern economy and how it differs from the other factors of production in terms of the reward for its services. [8].,"a
For knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise in the production process in a modern economy: Enterprise undertakes the organisation of the other factors of production (1 mark) It also bears the risk of production (1 mark)       (2 marks) For application: Profit is the reward to enterprise for its services (1 mark) In order to produce goods and services enterprise needs to hire labour which is rewarded with wages (1 mark), land which is the natural resource rewarded with rent (1 mark) and capital which is rewarded with interest (1 mark) Enterprise will utilise the other factors of production to produce goods and services that increase aggregate supply (1 mark). Aggregate supply will increase through an increase in productive potential or a fall in unused resources. (1 mark)        (Up to 6 marks)

Enterprise takes the risk of production and organises the other factors. In a modern economy this often leads to the divorce of ownership (shareholders) from control (management). Profit is the reward for enterprise, but profit is the reward for risk and in loss making firms there will be no profit. This contrasts with the rewards to labour, land and capital. Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period. In order to contribute to aggregate supply enterprise organises the other factors of production and takes the risk that costs will not exceed revenue leading to negative profit.

A market is in equilibrium when, given present circumstances, there is no tendency for change. In other words demand and supply are equal with an equilibrium price and quantity. The market clears at this point. Disequilibrium will occur when either the demand curve or supply curve shifts. Change will have to come about to restore equilibrium. Equilibrium is restored through price changes or changes in demand and/or supply in the market. Accept maximum or minimum prices as a cause of disequilibrium.

A rise in the terms of trade means that a given quantity of exports can purchase a greater quantity of imports and the opposite is true for a fall in the terms of trade. If the terms of trade rise exports might become uncompetitive however there is a potential rise in living standards. If there is a fall in the terms of trade exports become competitive, but inflation might rise as imports become expensive giving rise to cost-push inflation.

822,Explain how the factor of production enterprise contributes to aggregate supply in a modern economy and how it differs from the other factors of production in terms of the reward for its services. [8].,"a
For knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise in the production process in a modern economy: Enterprise undertakes the organisation of the other factors of production (1 mark) It also bears the risk of production (1 mark)       (2 marks) For application: Profit is the reward to enterprise for its services (1 mark) In order to produce goods and services enterprise needs to hire labour which is rewarded with wages (1 mark), land which is the natural resource rewarded with rent (1 mark) and capital which is rewarded with interest (1 mark) Enterprise will utilise the other factors of production to produce goods and services that increase aggregate supply (1 mark). Aggregate supply will increase through an increase in productive potential or a fall in unused resources. (1 mark)        (Up to 6 marks)

Enterprise takes the risk of production and organises the other factors. In a modern economy this often leads to the divorce of ownership (shareholders) from control (management). Profit is the reward for enterprise, but profit is the reward for risk and in loss making firms there will be no profit. This contrasts with the rewards to labour, land and capital. Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period. In order to contribute to aggregate supply enterprise organises the other factors of production and takes the risk that costs will not exceed revenue leading to negative profit.

Direct taxes include income tax and corporation tax. They have the disadvantage that there is widespread tax evasion especially in less developed economies.

A rise in the terms of trade means that a given quantity of exports can purchase a greater quantity of imports and the opposite is true for a fall in the terms of trade. If the terms of trade rise exports might become uncompetitive however there is a potential rise in living standards. If there is a fall in the terms of trade exports become competitive, but inflation might rise as imports become expensive giving rise to cost-push inflation.

836,Explain how the factor of production enterprise contributes to aggregate supply in a modern economy and how it differs from the other factors of production in terms of the reward for its services. [8].,"a
For knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise in the production process in a modern economy: Enterprise undertakes the organisation of the other factors of production (1 mark) It also bears the risk of production (1 mark)       (2 marks) For application: Profit is the reward to enterprise for its services (1 mark) In order to produce goods and services enterprise needs to hire labour which is rewarded with wages (1 mark), land which is the natural resource rewarded with rent (1 mark) and capital which is rewarded with interest (1 mark) Enterprise will utilise the other factors of production to produce goods and services that increase aggregate supply (1 mark). Aggregate supply will increase through an increase in productive potential or a fall in unused resources. (1 mark)        (Up to 6 marks)

Enterprise takes the risk of production and organises the other factors. In a modern economy this often leads to the divorce of ownership (shareholders) from control (management). Profit is the reward for enterprise, but profit is the reward for risk and in loss making firms there will be no profit. This contrasts with the rewards to labour, land and capital. Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period. In order to contribute to aggregate supply enterprise organises the other factors of production and takes the risk that costs will not exceed revenue leading to negative profit.

A market is in equilibrium when, given present circumstances, there is no tendency for change. In other words demand and supply are equal with an equilibrium price and quantity. The market clears at this point. Disequilibrium will occur when either the demand curve or supply curve shifts. Change will have to come about to restore equilibrium. Equilibrium is restored through price changes or changes in demand and/or supply in the market. Accept maximum or minimum prices as a cause of disequilibrium.

A market is in equilibrium when, given present circumstances, there is no tendency for change. In other words demand and supply are equal with an equilibrium price and quantity. The market clears at this point. Disequilibrium will occur when either the demand curve or supply curve shifts. Change will have to come about to restore equilibrium. Equilibrium is restored through price changes or changes in demand and/or supply in the market. Accept maximum or minimum prices as a cause of disequilibrium.

A rise in the terms of trade means that a given quantity of exports can purchase a greater quantity of imports and the opposite is true for a fall in the terms of trade. If the terms of trade rise exports might become uncompetitive however there is a potential rise in living standards. If there is a fall in the terms of trade exports become competitive, but inflation might rise as imports become expensive giving rise to cost-push inflation.

864,Explain how the factor of production enterprise contributes to aggregate supply in a modern economy and how it differs from the other factors of production in terms of the reward for its services. [8].,"a
For knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise in the production process in a modern economy: Enterprise undertakes the organisation of the other factors of production (1 mark) It also bears the risk of production (1 mark)       (2 marks) For application: Profit is the reward to enterprise for its services (1 mark) In order to produce goods and services enterprise needs to hire labour which is rewarded with wages (1 mark), land which is the natural resource rewarded with rent (1 mark) and capital which is rewarded with interest (1 mark) Enterprise will utilise the other factors of production to produce goods and services that increase aggregate supply (1 mark). Aggregate supply will increase through an increase in productive potential or a fall in unused resources. (1 mark)        (Up to 6 marks)

Enterprise takes the risk of production and organises the other factors. In a modern economy this often leads to the divorce of ownership (shareholders) from control (management). Profit is the reward for enterprise, but profit is the reward for risk and in loss making firms there will be no profit. This contrasts with the rewards to labour, land and capital. Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period. In order to contribute to aggregate supply enterprise organises the other factors of production and takes the risk that costs will not exceed revenue leading to negative profit.

Candidates need to recognise that subsidies can improve the allocation of resources if they are imposed upon merit goods. They will go some way to improving the under-consumption of the good. If subsidies are imposed upon demerit goods however they will exacerbate the over-consumption of these goods. Subsidies will not improve resource allocation if applied to public goods because they still need to be provided by the public sector. In the case of other goods that cannot be classified as merit, demerit or public goods subsidies will reduce the price below the equilibrium determined in a free market.

Commercial banks create new bank deposits every time they grant a loan. It is profitable for banks to create loans, so banks often have a significant effect on the broad definition of the money supply. However, there are limits to the ability of banks to create new deposits. These might include: the willingness of borrowers to borrow; leakages of funds (loans not re-deposited); the need for banks to maintain a safe amount of liquid assets; restrictions upon lending imposed by governments. L4 (9–12): for an answer that recognises that there are a number of limitations to the ability of commercial banks to create new deposits. Should refer to at least two reasons why commercial banks' ability to influence the money supply might be limited L3 (7–8): for an answer that analyses how banks can create money by granting loans and why banks have an incentive to do this. Might also refer to the importance of the bank credit multiplier L2 (5–6): for an answer that recognises that there are different definitions of the money supply and that the most important measure includes bank deposits which also account for the biggest proportion of this measure L1 (1–4): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant

970,Distinguish between structural and frictional unemployment. Consider which would be likely to have the greater negative effect on an economy. [12],"a
Structural unemployment arises from changes in the pattern of demand in an economy and is usually focused upon specific industries or geographical areas. It can also be caused by the introduction of new technology acting as a substitute for labour. Frictional (or search) unemployment arises due to imperfect information in the labour market. Workers are unemployed primarily due to the time taken to find a new job. Both types have a negative impact on an economy but it is generally assumed that structural unemployment will have a long-term impact and impose higher costs on society compared with frictional unemployment which normally lasts a relatively short time. Hence, it may be concluded that structural unemployment is likely to cause the greater negative impact. L4 (9–12): for a clear explanation of both types of unemployment and their main differences.

971,Assess the view that supply-side policies are the most effective way to solve the problem of structural unemployment. [13],"b
Supply side polices are government policies that attempt to alter the level of aggregate supply directly rather than through changes in aggregate demand. They can be market oriented or through direct government intervention. Interventionist policies might include: education and training. Market policies might include taxation; reduction in unemployment benefits – these policies would aim to increase labour geographical/occupation mobility and enable specific focus on unemployment caused by changes in the pattern of demand. Alternative policies such as Keynesian demand management policies would not be suitable because they would lack focus and may cause problems in those areas which are not experiencing high unemployment. However, supply-side policies often take a long time and they are frequently costly. L4 (9–13): for a discussion of the extent of the effectiveness of supply-side polices with some attempt to compare alternative demand management policies and some attempt to identify potential problems such as, the long time period needed for success or the high cost of intervention.

The factors of production are land, labour, capital and enterprise. Each has a distinct role in the production process. Specialisation occurs when workers are assigned specific tasks within a production process. This is usually called the division of labour. Workers will require less training to be an efficient worker. Therefore this will lead to an increase in labour productivity and firms will be able to benefit from economies of scale and increased efficiency.

12
Monetary policy is any action taken by the monetary authorities to change the quantity of money, the rate of interest or credit terms. It is usually operated by the central bank of an economy. When faced with inflation it is likely that the central bank will limit the money supply, raise the rate of interest and tighten credit controls. When faced with deflation these measures would be reversed. Whether the policy is likely to be effective depends Upon the extent to which spending is sensitive to changes in the money supply, the rate of interest and credit terms.

Fiscal policy is sometimes called 'budgetary policy'. It involves varying government spending and taxation to affect economic variables through changes in aggregate demand. Monetary policy refers to any government action to manage aggregate demand through control of the quantity of money, the rate of interest or credit terms.

12
The term 'supply-side policy' refers to any action taken by governments to influence aggregate supply. This could include action such as improving education and training, changing tax rates to affect economic activity and improving infrastructure. A shift in the aggregate supply curve to the right reduces inflationary pressure as aggregate demand can be satisfied with an increase in real output rather than an increase in prices. Contractionary fiscal policy will shift the aggregate demand curve to the left and reduce inflationary pressure. The weaknesses of supply-side policy include the pressure on the government budget and the long-time period before it takes effect. The weakness of fiscal policy is that higher tax rates can provide a disincentive effect and reduced government expenditure may cause social unrest.

8
The factor enterprise has two roles in a market economy. One is taking the risk of production, the other is organising the other factors in the production process. The reward for contributing to production is profit. If there is a rise in the demand for a good in a market economy, its price will rise. The factor enterprise will respond by expanding production in pursuit of more profit. The quantity of goods in the market will expand along the industry supply curve. An 'accurate' diagram will have axes and curves labelled correctly, the shift in the demand curve will be correct and there will be an extension in the quantity supplied. In awarding marks for application allow Up to 3 marks for the diagram. One mark should be reserved for an explanation of the role of enterprise in allocating resources to the production of the good. Please note that some knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise might be shown in the candidate's explanation of how enterprise responds to an increase in the demand for a good.

Equilibrium in a market occurs where there is 'no tendency for price or quantity to change'.In the market for a normal good, it occurs where the demand and supply curves intersect. If there is an increase in demand the demand curve will shift to the right causing an excess demand for the normal good. This will cause market forces to raise equilibrium price and quantity.

12

If an indirect tax is imposed the supply curve of the product will shift to the left. Consumers will have to pay a higher price and may be tempted to enter the black market. The consumer surplus will be reduced.
In addition, there will be a change in the tax revenue received by the government. The extent and direction of this change will depend upon the price elasticity of demand of the product.
Producers will have to charge higher prices and will face a fall in the quantity sold. The producer surplus will reduce.
Whether the arrangement will be overall beneficial depends upon a number of factors such as the nature of the product taxed and how the revenue raised is used. Although a diagram is not asked for in the question, candidates may include one to support their answer. As in (a),it will involve a shift to the left of the supply curve.

The terms of trade measures the relationship between changes in the price of an economy's exports and changes in the price of its imports.The formula needs to express the idea that we are measuring the ratio between changes in export prices and changes in import prices. This could be in the form of an index or more loosely a simple ratio between the two.The meaning of a rise in an economy's exchange rate is that more foreign currency can be bought with a given unit of that economy's currency.The meaning of a fall in an economy's  exchange rate is that less foreign currency can be bought with a given unit of that economy's currency.If the exchange rate rises this will lead to a rise in the terms of trade.If the exchange rate falls, this will lead to a fall in the terms of trade

This discussion relates to whether a tax on cigarettes is a 'waste of time' because the demand for cigarettes is price inelastic. The discussion also requires a consideration of policies to create better awareness amongst consumers.If the demand for a demerit good is price inelastic,the imposition of an indirect tax will not significantly reduce its consumption. The demand for demerit goods needs to be reduced. This could be done by using the revenue gained from an indirect tax to fund an awareness campaign. This will result in the demand curve for cigarettes shifting to the left.Diagrams are not required, but award credit if these are used effectively to support the explanation.Evaluative comment might suggest that the taxation is not a waste of time because it will reduce smoking to some extent. Others might suggest that revenue from the taxation could be used to fund the awareness campaign.

YED is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product divided by the percentage change in incomes.For a normal good, the YED will be positive for normal goods, i.e. as consumer incomes rise, the demand for products will rise.For an inferior good, the YED will be negative for inferior goods, i.e. as consumer incomes rise, the demand for products will fall.If there is an increase in consumer incomes, a supermarket is likely to stock more normal goods and fewer inferior goods.Necessity goods have a positive YED, but it is rather low, e.g. less than one (inelastic).If there is an increase in incomes, there is unlikely to be very much of an effect on supermarkets in terms of the stocking of necessity goods.

A private good has the characteristics of excludability and rivalry. This is normally achieved through the price mechanism and once a good is purchased, it cannot be consumed by others. Rivalry could also raise the price of a good. If a consumer does not have the resources,they cannot consume certain private goods. Public goods are provided to overcome this problem; they are nonexcludable and non-rival. Their provision does through raise the issue of free riders.

Public goods have the features of nonexcludabilty,non-rivalry in consumption. A motorway is often cited by candidates as apublic good, but consumers can be excluded from motorways through tolls and there is rivalry in consumption as traffic jams prove.If a candidate provides a reasoned argument that under some circumstances a motorway might be non-excludable and/or there is no rivalry in consumption this can be an acceptable approach.

8
The term deflation is used to describe aperiod in which there is a fall in the generalprice level. It is the opposite of inflation. Itis usually measured through falls in theCPI. There are a number of effects. For example, the value of savings increases.Consumers usually put off purchases hoping that prices will be lower in the future. This means that firms usually lower wages to preserve profits, but often they have to reduce production and this often causes unemployment. Investment also often declines. Although deflation is likely to lead to a fall in the terms of trade it may well result in an increase in revenues from exports. Also, the relative price of imports rises and this may result in lower import expenditures.

A freely floating exchange rate is determined by the free forces of the supply and demand for the currency in the foreign exchange market. A high rate of inflation could lead to a decline in the exchange rate because the goods and services produced by an economy become uncompetitive. The demand for the currency falls as the demand for exports fall and the supply of the currency rises as imports rise as their relative price falls.

1111,Discuss whether an understanding of price elasticity of demand is of more benefit to a producer of agricultural goods than an understanding of income elasticity of demand. [12],"b
For Analysis:That explains how an understanding of price elasticity might benefit producers which might include reference to the strengths and/or weaknesses of this measure. (Up to 4 marks)That explains how an understanding of income elasticity might benefit producers which might include reference to the strengths and/or weaknesses of this measure. (Up to 4 marks)8 marks maximumCredit reference to the production of agricultural goods, but this is not essential for full marks.  For Evaluation:That exercises some judgement in considering which type of elasticity would be most beneficial for a producer. This must make use of the analysis that is offered. There must be a conclusion for full marks.4 marks maximum

Both price elasticity and income elasticitywould be useful for the producer of agricultural goods. Price elasticity would inform a producer of the impact of price changes upon total revenue. Income elasticity would inform the producer of the appropriate goods to produce as incomes change. For example, if incomes are falling the producer might plant agriculturalproducts with negative elasticity. Evaluativecomment might comment on the fact that price elasticity would have a more immediate effect whereas income elasticity is of more long-term benefit to producers because it takes time for the new crops to be harvested.
