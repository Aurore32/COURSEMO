Some high-income countries have introduced high tariffs on some imports to reduce the negative effects of globalisation on their economies.
With the help of a diagram, evaluate this policy.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology.
Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on international trade.
One of the main potential negative effects of globalisation on high-income economies might be caused by the import of goods produced at low cost by other countries. This might cause a rise in unemployment.
Analysis should be provided to show the impact of selective tariffs on imports into high-income countries. A clear, accurately labelled diagram should be provided to underpin this analysis.
Further analysis should be provided to illustrate the potential impact on different stakeholders of these tariffs. For example, an increase in tax revenue can be re-invested into the economy to promote long term economic growth.

N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

The imposition of tariffs may lead to retaliation by other countries, possibly leading to a trade war and misallocation of resources.
Restricting imports and subsequent trade diversion will reduce allocative and productive efficiently and lead to a net welfare loss.
Tariffs will lead to higher prices for both consumers and producers due to lack of international competition.
In some cases, higher tariffs will lead to higher costs which could lead to higher prices, falling demand and ultimately increase the level of unemployment.
Although tariffs might reduce the negative effects of globalisation, they might also remove some existing benefits of globalisation. For example, by reducing choice for consumers.
Protecting inefficient domestic firms by using tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the economy in the long term.
A conclusion should attempt to use cost/benefit analysis and use the preceding analysis to examine the net effect of the introduction of selective tariffs by high-income countries on their economies.

A definition of what is meant by inflation.
An explanation of what constitutes the key components of the money supply. This should primarily consist of commercial bank balances held at the central bank plus all bank deposits held in the commercial banks.
Examples of the instruments available to use by the central bank to control the money supply. Reference to and explanation of Open Market operations/Quantitative Easing, plus the use of changes in interest rates should be made and explained.
The potential link between changes in the money supply and/or changes in the rate of interest rate and inflation should be examined.
Analysis of the use of specific monetary policy instruments and their impact on reducing the money supply should be provided. For example, examining the links between the sale of long-term government securities and changes in the level of bank deposits.
Analysis of how changes in interest rates/money supply might impact upon the level of aggregate demand and inflation. 

AO3 Evaluation

The money supply is very difficult to measure, thus there are many different definitions of what might constitute the money supply.
The link between changes in the money and changes in the price level is not altogether clear.
The link between changes in the rate of interest and changes in the money supply are not always clear. For example, an increase in the rate of interest might lead to an increase in savings. This would cause bank deposits and therefore, the money supply to rise.
The effectiveness of the use of monetary policy to control inflation will also depend upon the cause of inflation. For example, demand pull inflation might be controlled more effectively by the use of contractionary fiscal policy.
A conclusion should use the preceding discussion to decide the extent to which this type of monetary is likely to be used effectively to control inflation.

Characteristics of a perfectly competitive labour market should be described. This should be supported by a relevant diagram.
An explanation of how monopsony markets work should be provided, emphasising the importance of how wages are determined in this type of market.
A diagram should be provided which shows a monopsony labour market and used to show how wages and level of employment are determined.
Analysis should refer to the factors which affect both the supply of and demand for labour in both these types of labour market.

Note: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

Evaluation should then be used to link external factors which might affect final wage levels in both markets. For example, Trades Union or government intervention. In some cases, the intervention of Trades Union might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. This would support that wages would be higher in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Although a monopsony labour market model would predict lower wages due to buyer power on the part of monopsony firms, other factors will still determine the extent to which monopsony market wages will remain low. For example, the ease with which capital can be substituted for labour.
Also, the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry will influence the extent to which wages might rise in either market.
Accusations of labour exploitation might lead to government intervention in a monopsony labour market. A minimum wage might be fixed that it is higher than wages gained in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Trades Unions might also intervene in monopsony markets and enable workers to gain higher wages through collective bargaining.
Higher wages might not be sustainable in the long run in perfectly competitive markets, due to increases in the supply of labour responding to the opportunity to gain higher wages.
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the question preceding argument.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction.
This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.
One form of government intervention might be the introduction of indirect taxation. A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of an indirect taxation on the level of output and efficiency.
Analysis would use this to show the impact of an indirect tax on the PC curve.
Further analysis should then identify the links between the indirect tax and the behaviour of firms. This would link the creation of negative externalities to the benefits of removing them and then linking this to addressing this cause of market failure

N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce indirect taxation however it is difficult to determine the extent of the taxation necessary which will address the issue of market failure without causing other problems, for example, an increase in unemployment.
Also, the impact of indirect taxation in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Some large firms might produce and sell products which have an inelastic demand therefore this would be unlikely to have a significant impact on output and efficiency.
The introduction of indirect taxation might be costly and unnecessarily bureaucratic, as well as being difficult to monitor and enforce.
It might be that government intervention based on the use of alternative more direct approaches such as the use of pollution permit might be more effective.
Indirect taxation is regressive and might unfairly penalise lower income groups.
A conclusion should consider alternatives, compare these with the use of indirect taxation and attempt to form some judgement regarding the effectiveness of this type of policy.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition and explanation of long-term economic growth as a function of more inputs such as labour, land, and equipment creating an outwards shift of the productive possibility curve. Economic growth is measurable in terms of increases in real GDP.
Many developing countries are characterised by low incomes which prevent savings and the funds needed to finance investment and economic growth. Funding is needed to finance the investment and technological aspects of economic growth which comes from internal sources (savings) or from foreign lending/investment.
Foreign investment may be from governments (e.g. China’s Belt and Roads initiative), international agencies (e.g. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) or sovereign wealth funds. Governments borrow from other governments and international agencies to invest in infrastructure and other development projects which under lie economic growth.
Private capital investment via multinational corporations (e.g. Toyota, Intel). MNC investment is usually in factories, plant and machinery which increase output directly.
Candidates may analyse the effects of the increase in investment through aggregate supply and demand analysis.
Successful investment requires a return (marginal efficiency of capital (MEC)) which exceeds the rate of interest that has been relatively easy to obtain.
The effects of rising interest rates on developing countries: Many developing countries will suffer from falling exchange rates, especially if US$ interest rates rise this will increase the US$ funding cost of borrowings. The balance of payments (X-M) will deteriorate.
Accept references to IMF and World Bank lending investment funds.

AO3 Evaluation

Impact depends on the proportion of funding which comes from abroad and how much is locally sourced. If domestic funds are not available, then how else will the growth be funded.
The quality of the investment projects and the likelihood of realising a profit will affect the ability to cover the increase in interest rates. In some cases ‘vanity projects’ with little long-term economic benefit are funded (Roads to Nowhere) which enhance the standing of the government amongst its supporters but have no economic benefit.
The short-term effects of the project in terms of raising aggregate demand may be of limited benefit to the borrower if the lender requires much of the construction and materials to be sourced from them. This will have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments.
Higher interest rates in high income countries will raise the cost of borrowing by the low-income country. This means the cost of financing projects has risen representing an opportunity cost for borrowing. The balance of payments current account will deteriorate as the higher interest is paid.
Many low-income countries may be affected by a commodity price slump which reduces export earnings and depreciates a floating exchange rate making interest rate and capital repayment more expensive.

AO3 Evaluation

Evaluation against productive, allocative and/or dynamic efficiency.
Privatisation may lead to the break-up of a natural monopoly e.g. railways/water pipelines. The problem of the ‘final mile delivery’.
A state monopoly may simply be replaced with a private monopoly. Competition may be unrealistic due to high barriers to entry (BTE).
Many privatisations are accompanied by an industry regulator which suggests that the privatisation needs policing. The amount and direction of investment, and the pricing strategy are reviewed to maintain the industry’s efficiency.
Equity the transfer of profitable state-owned assets to private individuals means the contribution they might make to the state funds are lost.
Often there is a loss of employment in the industry and the burden of unemployment pay falls on the government raising the fiscal deficit or requiring more borrowing.
Private firms are only concerned with private costs and benefits, they ignore negative externalities and their consequences.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting secondary/tertiary goods/services.
High living standards are generally associated with: low poverty levels; advanced infrastructure; good housing, education and health; and low infant mortality rates.
Economic growth is usually measured by changes in real GDP per capita in a specific time period.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita.
Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth. 
Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a high-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in economic growth and an increase in living standards are not clear. Economic growth is a quantitative measure not a qualitative measure
Economic growth which depends upon globalisation would increase long distance transport which would create more negative externalities.
It is not clear how any benefits of economic growth might be used in a high-income economy
Globalisation might lead to an increase in cheap imports from low-income economies which might lead to higher levels of unemployment in more advanced economies.
A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term benefits of globalisation in relation to the improvement of living standards in high-income countries. Also a judgement should consider whether this will automatically improve living standards.

AO3 Evaluation

Increasing the use of subsidies and/or decreasing the use of indirect taxation is likely to have a negative effect on a government’s budget. For example, increasing the budget deficit and subsequently increasing the need for more government borrowing.
Removing tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the incomes and output of domestic producers and possibly lead to an increase in unemployment
The introduction of incomes policies is likely to lead to opposition from trade Unions and the possibility of industrial disruption.
Long run supply-side policies are likely to focus on attempts to increase productivity. This frequently involves significant investment in new technology which will lead to a rise in unemployment in the short run
Other policies which might be used in the long run might include immediate investment in skills training and improving the quality of the infrastructure. Skills training is expensive and hence has a high initial opportunity cost. While the immediate effect of an increase in expenditure on improving the infrastructure is likely to increase aggregate demand and add to the inflationary pressure 
A conclusion should attempt to assess the relative effectiveness of each type of policy approach and consider which approach is likely to be the most effective in the short run and then compare this with possible outcomes that might be achieved in the long run.

AO3 Evaluation

In some cases, the introduction of trade unions might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. Although an increase in productivity might also be produced by substituting capital for labour which might lead to an increase in unemployment.
Trade unions might gain higher wages for labour but because this makes capital relatively cheaper, machines might be substituted for labour which will further reduce employment.
The impact of higher wages on employment will also depend upon how easy it is to substitute capital for labour and the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry.
If trade unions manage to bargain for higher wages but the new wage is above the market equilibrium, there will be an excess supply of labour at the new wage leading to higher unemployment. The extent of this impact will be determined by the relative elasticities of supply of and demand for labour

The link between climate change on negative externalities is very difficult to accurately establish

The use of minimum prices to reduce negative externalities would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.

Aid can be defined as any assistance given to a country that would not be provided through normal market forces.
There are two main types of aid, humanitarian aid; development aid. Development aid would include many different types including: long term loans; tied aid; bilateral aid and multilateral aid.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population grow.
Aid that focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
Aid can increase real wealth and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in aid and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes aid only reaches a relatively small section of the population. For example, due to corruption.
Different types of aid might produce different outcomes. For example, aid in the form of long-term loans might make it more difficult for low-income countries to escape the cycle of poverty.
Aid is sometimes given for political reasons rather than the low-income countries where the need is the greatest.
Tied aid might mean that low--income countries receiving such aid have to purchase goods and services from the donor country which are more expensive.
Long term dependency upon aid might lead to a welfare mentality and reduce levels of innovation in the low-income country.
A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term efficacy of development aid in relation to the improvement of living standards in low-income countries.

Fiscal policy would require a government to use taxation and government expenditure changes to influence key macroeconomic goals such as inflation, economic growth and the level of employment.
An output gap will show the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.
A negative output will indicate that there is spare capacity in an economy which will be primarily due to insufficient aggregate monetary demand. A relevant diagram can be used to illustrate this gap.
Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to significantly influence aggregate demand by either increase its expenditure or reducing the overall level of taxation.
A budget deficit will inject additional demand into an economy which will have a magnified effect on output, income and employment due to the positive contribution of a multiplier effect.

AO3 Evaluation

Fiscal policy could help to close a negative output gap by increasing a government’s budget deficit but this may lead to higher interest rates and crowding out in the private sector.
It is difficult for a government to produce an accurate forecast of the magnitude of the output gap.
Although a budget deficit might help to reduce a negative output gap in the short run, if the deficit is financed by increasing the money supply, this might lead to inflation in the long run.
Alternative policies such as supply-side policies might be more effective by closing the output gap while avoiding the risk of inflation in the long run.
Expansionary fiscal policies used to close an output gap might lead to an increase in the demand for imports and subsequently, a negative impact on the country’s balance of payments.
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

Characteristics of a monopolistically competitive market should be described.
Difference between short run and long run profit maximizing output in monopolistically competitive markets.
A monopoly market should be described, including main characteristics and key difference between this type of market and monopolistic competition i.e. barriers to entry.
Different types of efficiency should be identified and explained.
Analysis should discuss the links between monopoly and higher prices and inefficiency. This analysis can then be used to compare both monopoly and monopolistically competitive markets.
Analysis should then be used to compare short run and long run outcomes on both types of market. 

AO3 Evaluation

Some monopolies might invest in new technology and achieve dynamic efficiency. This will enable lower average total costs and an opportunity to pass the benefits of lower costs on in the form of lower prices.
Similarly, monopolies might benefit from economies of scale which might also lead to lower prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms might incur additional costs through the need to engage in non-price competition. This might lead to higher prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms will achieve productive efficiency in the long run but a profit maximizing firm will not operate at an allocatively efficient level of output.
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement by addressing both price levels and efficiency outcomes in relation to both types of market structure. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

Analysis of how market forces can be used to solve the problem of market failure, caused by negative externalities.

AO3 Evaluation

Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximisation and this might lead to these firms focusing upon private costs and ignoring social cost.
The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all market inefficiency because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.
The use of minimum prices would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces. Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Consider the relative merits of gross national income (GNI) and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as measures of the standard of living.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and TableB: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 14 marks. AO3 out of 6 marks.
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition of GNI: the total income earned within a country in a year plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production. This is an aggregate measure of an economy’s income.
GNI measures in monetary terms.
For many developing countries which rely on remittances from overseas workers, this will boost the value of GNI.
Other countries that have invested overseas will receive a stream of dividends and interest that boosts their GNI.
Definition of the MPI
Some explicit breakdown of the categories which are involved in the construction of MPI
Health: 1/3rd weighting includes child mortality and nutrition (1/6th each);
Education: 1/3rd weighting includes years of schooling and school attendance (1/6th each); and
Standard of living 1/3 weighting includes cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing and assets (1/18th each).
The measures are fundamentally different in their approaches GNI is concerned with money values whilst MPI is concerned with the adequacy of provision of a number of essential services and goods linked to the Millennium Development Goals.

AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation may be by individual measure or by comparing the measures.

GNI The comprehensiveness of the data collection: 
The GNI figures needs deflating for the effects of price increases and changes in the population to achieve real GNI per head, which allows for comparisons over time.
The range of incomes which are included ‘the dark economy’, illegal activity – drugs crime etc. the ability to count all income flows between countries. 
Incomes from activities that produce negative externalities or are the result of monopoly profits increase the GNI but reduce the level of economic efficiency.
Real GNI per head can be used as a simple measure of economic growth but lacks a distributional measure. Additional measures such as the Gini coefficient need to be calculated to gain a measure of the distributional effect of a given GNI. Both these measures are averages which disguise a wide range of individual circumstances.
The data collection for MPI is more complex than for GNI. The criteria for GNI are well established and are given.
Monetary-based poverty measures can omit a lot. The overlap between monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty is not perfect. In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.
Economic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation. Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.
Real GNI per head data is available for 188 (most) countries of the world whilst MPI data is only available for 103 poorer countries. 
MPI for education measures inputs not outputs, attending school is not the same as learning to read

AO3 Evaluation

Consumer rationality: indifference analysis assumes that consumers act rationally. They are of a calculating mind, carrying numerous combinations of different commodities in their heads, can substitute one for the other, compare their total utilities and make a rational choice between various combinations of goods.
As the effect of a reduction in price is an increase in demand for both a normal and inferior good (except in the case of Giffen good) it is not possible to know whether a good is normal or inferior.
It is difficult to apply the concept of substitutability to goods such as consumable durables, which are one-off indivisible purchases and the choice is between, for example, 1 fridge and 4 weeks’ food.
A consumer is faced with a much more complex world than the two-good world of the model because a consumer buys not just two but a large number of commodities to satisfy their innumerable wants.
IC analysis is a static analysis and consumer preferences may change over time.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
High-income countries are likely to benefit from access to a wide range of goods and services and access to good health care and education.
Comparative advantage allows high-income countries to increase their standard of living by providing access to cheap raw materials produced in low-income countries.
Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries.

Assess the contribution of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the improvement of the standard of living in low-income countries.

Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion.

FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.
This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.
FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a lowincome economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living. 

However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run.
AO3 Evaluation

The links between globalization and the costs/benefits imposed on lowincome countries is not clear. For example, low-income countries might benefit significantly from the transfer of new technology from high income countries.
Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore helping to train the indigenous population.
Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth which can then be used to provide merit goods such as health care and education.
In some cases, individual firms in low-income countries might gain access to large markets in high-income countries which will subsequently allow new businesses to grow
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to benefit both high and low-income countries, but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall positive impact.

AO3 Evaluation

The effectiveness of monetary policy is likely to depend to some extent upon the cause of unemployment. Monetary policy can be used to influence aggregate monetary demand which will be more effective dealing with cyclical unemployment.
The use of some monetary instruments might have a negative effect on macroeconomic aims. For example, reducing interest rates might depreciate the currency and potentially promote either cost push or demand-pull inflation.
Alternative policies might be more effective if structural factors are responsible for unemployment. In this case, supply-side policies might be more effective.
Lowering interest rates might cause problems for specific industries within an economy. For example, low interest rates might cause a boom in the housing market.
A conclusion should make an attempt to make an overall comparison between the use of monetary policy and alternative fiscal or supply side policies. A judgement should be made which directly addresses the statement in question.

This merger is an example of horizontal integration where two firms merge at the same level in the production cycle.
Mergers of two large firms producing similar goods, at the same level in the production cycle is likely to lead to a monopoly market structure.
Monopoly providers, through market dominance, can raise prices and drive smaller firms out of business. A diagram might provide supporting analysis.
Given the nature of the goods provided, this merger might also lead to significantly less choice.
A large, dominant organization might have less incentive to operate efficiently and X inefficiencies might occur.
Analysis of the potential negative impact on the local labour market.

NOTE: Limit of Level 2 if no relevant diagram
AO3 Evaluation

Merging firms might argue that an increase in size will lead to more opportunities to provide a wide range of goods and therefore more consumer choice.
Also, it is possible that the merger will lead to an increase in dynamic efficiency and this increase would allow long term more investment and ultimately lower prices. A supporting diagram can be provided.
Such a merger will enable the firms to benefit from economies of scale. For example, reducing managerial inefficiencies. This could also lead to lower prices.
Any potential negative effects of this merger can be accounted for by government intervention and regulation when the merger takes place.

Analysis of the relationship between the public provision of health care and efficient outcomes should be provided.
Analysis of the possible causes of inefficiency relating to the provision of health care by the public sector

AO3 Evaluation

Private providers of health care are unlikely to provide an allocatively efficient level of health care because of a failure to take into account the additional benefits of positive externalities.
Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximization and this might lead to a higher cost of receiving health care.
If access to health care in the private sector is based on an ability to pay, this might create inequitable outcomes in society.
The pursuit of profit might lead private firms to cut costs and reduce any unnecessary bureaucracy thus leading to a more efficient use of scarce resources.
The substitution of public provision by private provision might enable additional resources to become available in the public sector.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative ie private or public sector provision of health care.
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC or MSB = MSC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency. 
Negative externalities occur when the when the consumption/use of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that received by an individual producer MPB > MSB or MSC >MPC. This is sometimes described as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect. The negative externality leads to an over production of the good.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-consumption of a good or service. 
Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised. 
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies for consumers to increase consumption and also producers to change production methods, use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services such as alternative transport methods. Indirect taxation. Nudge theory effects. 
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive/negative externality on the level of output and the welfare change will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a negative consumption externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the negative externality is taken into account. The diagram may be amended or re-drawn to show the impact of a chosen policy(ies) and the impact on consumption or production shown. 
Reference to the diagram and the outcomes it illustrates is made in the text. 

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy. 
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached. 
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces. 
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

28,To what extent do you agree that an increase in productivity will lead to a higher standard of living in low-income countries? [20],"


Question
Answer
Marks

Low – income countries might increase productivity due the transfer of new technology from high income countries, however this might lead to a substitution of capital for labour thus increasing the level of unemployment. 
An increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) might lead to the exploitation of the indigenous raw materials, thus leading to a long run decline in economic growth. 
Increases in productivity might provide opportunities to create more real wealth but it will still depend upon a government in a low – income country to ensure that any increases in wealth lead to equitable outcomes. 

It is relatively easy to link an increase in productivity to the availability of more goods, however living standards are also influenced by an increase in the provision of services such as health and education. It is not easy to measure change 

In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for an increase in productivity to influence living standards in low re – income countries but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have a less direct positive impact. 

Accept all valid responses. 

The links between an increase in FDI and GDP and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by MNCs in lowincome countries. The majority of MNC profit might be repatriated rather than re – invested in the low re – income country. 
Higher skilled work might be provided separately by the MNC therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place. In some cases it has been argued that MNCs extract key resources and then leave.
It is not certain that a government will use the increase in tax revenue to invested in key sectors such as health, education and the country’s infrastructure. 
es in productivity in relation to services such as health and education.
A government in a low-income economy has to decide whether to allow FDI into their economy which might produce short – term benefits but result in long re – term consequences of resource depletion in the long run. 
It is very difficult to measure changes in living standards. Increases in GDP might not be divided equally among the population. FDIs might introduce external costs of production which are likely to have a negative effect on overall living standards. 
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for FDIs to improve   living standards but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negative impact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not focus entirely on an increase in access to material goods and services.

The impact of a budget surplus in the short run on the level of unemployment will depend upon the main cause of the existing level of unemployment. 
A budget surplus is more likely to have a negative effect on unemployment when an economy has a lot of existing spare capacity.
If structural factors are responsible for unemployment, supply side policies might be more effective. 
A budget surplus might lead to lower interest rates and cause problems for specific industries within an economy. For example, low interest rates might cause a boom in the housing market.
If a budget surplus leads to a subsequent fall in interest rate, this might ultimately make it more difficult to control a balance of payments in the long run.

If firms are rational profit – maximisers, the firms must benefit from their action therefore the initial point that the producer will always benefit is true. 
As total spending on the good / service takes place this represents a transfer of consumer surplus to the producers. 
But it depends on whether the firms gain at the expense of consumer and society. 
If the price discrimination exists between domestic and foreign markets The producer may also be able to drive competition from the foreign market if it charges high domestic prices / recovers overheads domestically. This may improve a country’s balance of payments. 
Some consumers gain and some lose. The lower price in the low PED market will benefit those consumers in that market whilst the opposite occurs in the High PED market. 
The increase in profits may allow the producer to increase its research and development leading to innovative production techniques which lower long term costs – dynamic efficiency. The benefits of the dynamic efficiency may be enjoyed by consumers / society as lower prices. 
The assessment of the statement should conclude with the view that it should benefit the producer as a matter of rationality but whether this is always at the expense of consumers / society is debateable. Accept all valid responses.

The use of subsidies to encourage the provision of education in the private sector might not be entirely successful because of the difficulties involved when attempting to assess the precise level of subsidy required to achieve an allocatively efficient outcome. 
Subsidies provided by the public sector are often expensive and their use will automatically create opportunity costs. For example, money spent on state subsidies to health care 
Subsidies in the private sector will mean that access to education is still based on an ability to pay, this might create inequitable outcomes in society. 
The pursuit of profit supported by subsidies might enable private firms to cut costs and reduce any unnecessary bureaucracy thus leading to a more efficient use of scarce resources. 
Direct state provision of education might lead to less efficient outcomes and reduce the time taken to ensure a high standard of education is available on an equal basis throughout the population. 
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. private or public sector provision of education. 
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primarygoods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to beachieved.
Globalization through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth. 
Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard ofliving.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between globalisation and GDP and an increase in living standards in low-income countries are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by more advanced, higher income countries. inlow- income countries
Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries
Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place.
In somecases, individual firms in low-income countries might be outcompeted and go out of business. Unemployment might then rise and living standards might fall.
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to improve the standard of living but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negativeimpact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not rely entirely on the material benefits gained by globalisation.

AO3 Evaluation

The impact of expenditure reducing policies will depend upon the state of the economy when these policies are introduced. For example, raising interest rates when an economy is experiencing high levels of inflation and a positive output gap will have a limited effect on unemployment.
If contractionary fiscal policies are used the impact on unemployment will depend upon the main cause of the existing level of unemployment.
Contractionary demand side policies might also be accompanied by positive supply side policies which might simultaneously reduce structural unemployment.

Colluding oligopolistic firms might argue that an increase in size will lead to more opportunities to provide a wide range of goods and therefore more consumer choice.
It is possible that collusion will lead to an increase in dynamic efficiency and this increase would allow long term more investment and ultimately lower prices. A supporting diagram can be provided.
Such a decision will enable the firms to benefit from economies of scale. For example, reducing managerial inefficiencies. This could also lead to lower prices.

Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion. 

FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.
This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.
FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a low-income economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country's government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.
However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run. 

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in FDI and GDP and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by MNCs in lowincome countries. The majority of MNC profit might be repatriated rather than re-invested in the low-income country.
Higher skilled work might be provided separately by the MNC therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place. In some cases it has been argued that MNCs extract key resources and then leave.
It is not certain that a government will use the increase in tax revenue to invested in key sectors such as health, education and the country's infrastructure.
A government in a low-income economy has to decide whether to allow FDI into their economy which might produce short-term benefits but result in long-term consequences of resource depletion in the long run.
It is very difficult to measure changes in living standards. Increases in GDP might not be divided equally among the population. FDIs might introduce external costs of production which are likely to have a negative effect on overall living standards. 
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for FDIs to improve living standards but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negative impact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not focus entirely on an increase in access to material goods and services.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

A devaluation relates to a decision by a government to fix the exchange rate of its domestic currency at a new lower level.
A persistent balance of payments deficit on a country's current account in goods and services will create problems because it has to be financed. If it is not financed by positive currency flows on the financial account due to direct investment or portfolio investment, it will have to be financed by reducing its reserves of foreign currency. This particular problem will only apply to a country that has adopted a fixed exchange rate.
In this situation the difference between the short run and the long run will be determined by the time taken to reduce the deficit and will also be measured by the final impact on the general price level that is the rate of inflation.
A devaluation of the domestic currency will immediately make all exported goods cheaper and all imported goods more expensive. On this basis it is assumed more exports will be sold and fewer goods will be imported. This would then help to reduce a balance of payments deficit.
To some extent, the ability of domestic suppliers to reduce a country’s current account balance deficit in the short run will depend on how domestic suppliers respond to the opportunity to sell more exports at a lower price. We can measure this response by calculating the price elasticity of supply of domestic producers.
A devaluation might not solve a balance of payments deficit on a country’s current account in goods and services in the short run because domestic supply of goods might be inelastic. This means domestic producers cannot increase output sufficiently to meet the additional demand for exports.
Further analysis of a devaluation on the general price level could be provided. For example, analysis might consider the proportion of imports accounted for by raw materials and how this might affect the cost of goods and services provided in an economy and how an increase in costs might lead to cost push inflation. Links to other costs such as subsequent wage demands might also be examined.

AO3 Evaluation 

In the long run it is necessary to consider both the price elasticity of demand for imports and the price elasticity of demand for exports. The Marshall-Lerner condition states that the sum of the two elasticities must be greater than one to achieve a successful outcome. 
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low. 
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

A perfect labour market would assume homogenous labour, perfect mobility, identical jobs, many buyers and sellers of labour and perfect information. This would mean that each firm’s supply of labour would be perfectly elastic and a wage taker.
In perfect labour markets the wage that has to be taken by each firm will be determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the industry.
Imperfect labour markets might occur due to the intervention of trade unions or government. A monopsony, single buyer of labour would also lead to market failure. 
Market failure associated with imperfect markets will often result in lower wages and/or higher levels of unemployment.
Intervention by trade unions by controlling the supply of labour might lead to higher wages but this is likely to cause higher levels of unemployment. A diagram that illustrates supply of and demand for labour showing a decrease in supply will illustrate this potential outcome.
A government might impose a minimum wage above the market equilibrium wage which would also result in higher wages but would be accompanied by higher levels of unemployment. This analysis would be supported by an accurate, clearly labelled diagram plus an explanation. 
A monopsony firm would employ labour where the marginal cost of labour was equal to the marginal revenue product of labour. This would potentially lead to both lower wages and higher levels of unemployment. An accurately labelled diagram plus an explanation would support this conclusion.

AO3 Evaluation

In some circumstance it is possible for trade unions to increase labour productivity through increased training. This would increase the demand for labour by increasing the marginal productivity of labour which would enable both higher wages and higher levels of employment to be attained. This can be illustrated by a supporting diagram and further explanation.
The negative impact of imposing a minimum wage on the level of employment will depend upon the relative elasticities of the demand for and supply of labour. If the demand and supply are relatively inelastic then it would be possible to introduce a relatively high minimum wage which will not have a significant impact on the level of employment.
It is possible for trade unions to intervene in monopsonistic markets and undertake bilateral wage negotiations. Depending on the respective bargaining strengths of the union and monopsony, it might be possible for collective bargaining to raise both wages and employment. A supporting diagram plus an explanation would illustrate this potential outcome. 
In some circumstances a government might need to intervene to maintain the provision of vital public services as a priority, if trade unions attempt to increase wages through the withdrawal of labour. 
In conclusion it is possible to show that imperfect labour markets do not always lead to lower wages and a higher level of unemployment. Trade unions, through the power of collective bargaining, can counteract the negative effects of monopsony labour markets. Also trade unions can train labour to increase labour productivity to enable an increase in wages at the same time that employment levels are rising.

Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Positive externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a benefit to society which is greater than that received by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimes described as a positive ‘spill-over’ effect.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-production/consumption of a good or service.
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies; the use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services.
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a positive externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the positive externality is taken into account.
Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised.
One type of intervention might involve the use of subsidies provided by a government. A subsidy will lower the cost of production which will increase supply. An increase in supply will lower price, increase the equilibrium output and achieve allocative efficiency.
A government might use advertising to increase demand. An increase in demand will lead to a higher consumption, output will rise and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.
Alternatively, a government might directly provide the good or service which can increase production and supply and eventually attain an allocatively efficient outcome.

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached.
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.
