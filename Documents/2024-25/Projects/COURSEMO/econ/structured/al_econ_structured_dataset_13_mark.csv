The introduction of new technology will increase efficiency but will also cause an increase in unemployment.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement?
An increase in productivity will produce a more efficient outcome in an economy. An increase in productivity will be attained when there is an increase in output per unit of resource used in a given time period. This is usually measured by an increase in output per unit of labour employed in a given time period. The introduction of new technology in form of more advanced, more efficient machinery, should enable labour to increase productivity. However, this increase in productivity is often achieved by substituting capital for labour. As a result the level of unemployment will rise.
It should be noted that this is usually linked to a specific type of unemployment known as structural unemployment. There are a number of causes of unemployment for example, cyclical unemployment which are not linked to the introduction of new technology. Therefore, to some extent the statement might be correct in that structural unemployment might rise due to the substitution of capital for labour.
It is also necessary to distinguish between the short run immediate impact of the introduction of new technology. In the long run, it is possible that an increase in productivity will lead to falling prices, more consumer demand and ultimately more demand for labour. Also it is possible that the introduction of new technology will further reduce the cost of producing capital which will also lead to further increases in productivity. Further increases in productivity might then lead to a fall in the price of exported goods and a further increase in aggregate demand. In this case employment might rise in the long run.

83,83,Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market. [13],"b

Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Answers should clearly identify and explain the key assumptions which explain the difference between these two labour markets. A monopsony market will consist of a single employer of labour; as a result the supply of labour to the firm will be upward sloping to the right. A profit maximising monopsonist employer will employ labour up to the point where the marginal cost of employing labour is equal to the marginal productivity of labour. A firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market will pay a wage determined by the market as a whole. The firm will be a wage taker and the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at the given wage.
Supporting diagrams in each case should clarify this difference. An increase in labour productivity would be reflected by an increase in the marginal physical product and therefore an increase in the marginal product of labour. In both market situations this would lead to a shift to the right of the firms MRP curve which is equivalent to an increase in the demand for labour. The impact in the case of monopsony will depend upon the extent of the increase in productivity. In a monopsony market, a significant increase in productivity will lead to a relatively higher increase in wages and employment but the extent of these changes will also be determined to some extent by the marginal cost of employing additional labour. In a perfectly competitive market, an increase in productivity will increase the demand for labour but the wage rate will remain the same.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of the difference between monopsony and a perfectly competitive labour market and a detailed analysis of the relationship between an increase in productivity, change in MRP and change in demand for labour. This analysis will then be applied to both markets and the respective impact of these changes on wages and employment in both markets will be compared.
L3 (7–8 marks): For competent analysis which clearly distinguishes between the two types of market and understands the relationship between changes in productivity, MRP and the demand for labour. An attempt should be made to compare the impact on wages and employment in both markets but the analysis will not be fully developed.

85,85,Limit pricing may sometimes be used by a monopoly. It creates a barrier to entry which benefits consumers in the short run but increases costs to the consumer in the long run.Discuss this statement. [13],"b

Limit pricing may sometimes be used by a monopoly. It creates a barrier to entry which benefits consumers in the short run but increases costs to the consumer in the long run.
Discuss this statement.
Monopoly firms will control the entire market or in some legal definitions, control at least 25% of the market. Barriers to entry will be used to prevent new firms entering the market and any subsequent loss of market share. It is also assumed that Monopoly firms will attempt to maximise profits and this will be achieved by letting the level of output be determined by the point where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). In some circumstances, when the market price falls to a relatively low level, it becomes possible for a new firm to enter the market and profit by charging a price which covers its costs. To prevent this, Monopoly firms might choose to lower their profit maximising but still cover costs and still maintain a satisfactory level of profits.
Monopolies can benefit from dynamic efficiency which is likely to lower average total costs compared to a new smaller firm attempting to enter the market. The new price is known as a Limit price and this can be shown with the help of a diagram which identifies a monopoly’s cost curve and a chosen limit price which is lower than the costs of the new firm. This is why limit pricing can act as a barrier to entry. On this basis it is likely that consumers will benefit in the short run due to a Monopoly firm’s decision to lower prices. However, in the long run, if the threat of entry has been removed and with it the threat to maintaining its market share, it is possible that a monopoly will then revert to its profit maximising policy. This will lead to higher prices which will have a negative impact on consumers and higher prices might now be maintained for a longer time period because the threat of competition has been removed.
Alternatively, the monopoly might invest the additional profits in research and development and achieve dynamic efficiency which will enable costs to be further reduced and low prices maintained.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of monopoly and why limit pricing might be used as a barrier to entry. The links between dynamic efficiency, low costs and the use of limit pricing as a barrier to entry should by analysed. The benefits to the consumer in the short run and potential costs in the long run should be evaluated and a conclusion provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent analysis of the relationship between a monopoly, dynamic efficiency, limit pricing and barriers to entry. Some limited comment will be made in relation to the potential difference to costs/benefits to the consumer in the short run and the long run.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a brief, descriptive approach which refers to monopoly and the use of limit pricing. Detailed analysis will not be provided to illustrate why limit pricing can act as a barrier to entry. No attempt to consider the difference between short and long run implications of pricing policy.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

87,87,Pareto optimality can only be achieved when an economy is both productively and allocatively efficient. This will create a more equitable society.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [13],"b

Pareto optimality can only be achieved when an economy is both productively and allocatively efficient. This will create a more equitable society. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Answers should provide a clear explanation that productive efficiency is achieved when a firm achieves minimum average total cost for a given level of output or alternatively when an economy is operating on its production possibility boundary. Allocative efficiency will be achieved when resources are allocated to ensure that the price of a unit charged to the consumer is equal to the marginal cost of producing that unit. In this case the firm will produce at an output where price (AR) = marginal cost (MC).
At a macroeconomic level, allocative efficiency will be attained when all resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction in society. This will be attained when an economy is operating at one specific point on its production possibility curve. Pareto optimality will be achieved when it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off. Any point below the production possibility curve would not be optimal because it would not fulfil this condition. Similarly an economy which is not operating at the unique allocatively efficient point on the production possibility curve would also not fulfil this condition, therefore the first part of the statement in the question is correct.
However, equity relates to an outcome where the distribution of income and/or wealth is considered to be fair. Governments can intervene, for example, through the use of re-distributive fiscal policies to produce a more equitable outcome but Pareto optimality which produces efficient outcomes will not automatically lead to a more equitable outcome. Thus the statement in the question is only partially correct.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains productive and allocative efficiency. Each type of efficiency should by analysed from a macroeconomic perspective. The concept of Pareto optimality should be explained and clearly linked to both types of efficiency. The second part of the statement should be discussed by explaining what is meant by equity and discussing whether there is a link between Pareto optimality and equity. A conclusion should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent comment which clearly defines productive and allocative efficiency. Pareto optimality might be explained and partially linked to different types of efficiency. Equity would be briefly described but not clearly discussed in relation to Pareto optimality and no conclusion will be provided.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a descriptive explanation of both types of efficiency and a definition of Pareto optimality. The link between efficiency and Pareto optimality will not be clearly established and there will be no attempt to distinguish between efficiency and equity and no attempt made to address the specific question.

The most important aim of a central bank is to control the money supply while the most important aim of a commercial (retail) bank is to maximise profits.
Discuss the extent to which these two aims can be achieved together.
Central banks have a number of important roles. One of the most important roles is the use of monetary policy to try and ensure financial stability and help a government to meet its target rate of inflation. Monetary policy would include the use of interest rate changes, exchange rate changes and controlling the money supply. The need to control the money supply is strongly linked to the relationship between the amount of money in an economy can have an important impact on the rate of inflation. Different policy instruments are available to a central bank to enable control of the money supply, these might include changes in interest rates and/or the use of open market operations.
Commercial banks are responsible for creating the largest proportion of the money supply, because banks grant loans which produce new bank deposits which automatically add to the money supply. Therefore, if a central bank increases interest rates, less borrowing from the commercial banks will take place, when bank lending falls bank deposits will fall. When this takes place, the central bank will have achieved its aim of decreasing the money supply. However, commercial bank lending is one of the main sources of commercial bank profits. On this basis one could argue that central bank policy is likely to lead to a fall in commercial bank profits. If this is true then it would seem that the two aims referred to in the statement in question are not compatible. But it could also be argued that the demand for bank loans might be interest inelastic. In this case higher interest rates are likely to lead to an increase in commercial bank profits and therefore the two aims might be compatible.
L4 (9–13 marks) For a response which explains why central banks would want to control the money supply and how commercial banks might maximise profits. Analysis of the impact of changes in the rate of interest on the money supply and also on commercial banks’ profits should be provided. A discussion of the extent to which the two aims are compatible should then follow, supported by a conclusion.

Distinguish between economic rent and transfer earnings and with the help of diagrams discuss why famous sports people receive much higher pay than street cleaners.
Transfer earning is the minimum payment to a worker to remain in their job. Economic rent is that payment beyond that necessary to keep a factor of production in its current use. A diagram can be used to identify this difference in the labour market. Links between the elasticity of supply of labour and transfer earnings and economic rent can be further established with the help of diagrams. Famous sports people have special talents which mean that the supply of such players is limited and very inelastic. Provided there is a strong demand to watch tennis, then it is likely that famous sports people will receive very high pay. Moreover, because their particular skill is not transferable, most of a sports person's high pay will in the form of economic rent.
The supply of street cleaners is likely to be highly elastic because of the low skill levels required and the short training period necessary. Therefore, even if demand for street cleaners rose significantly, it is still unlikely that they would be able to gain a high pay rise. Also the combination of a high and elastic supply should lead to most of their pay consisting of transfer payments. It is possible for pay levels to fall for famous sports people if they fail to provide sufficient entertainment and the demand to watch an individual player falls or if there is a general decline in the demand to watch professional sports. It is also possible for pay levels of street cleaners to rise if they form part of a Trades Union or benefit from changes in government policy regarding the pay of workers in the public sector.

101,101,Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure. [13],"b

Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure.
Collusion takes place when firms find that it is in their interest to co-operate with their rivals to maximise profits. Usually this will mean that firms agree together to fix output or prices or both output and price. This is known as forming a cartel. It is also known as formal collusion and is usually illegal. Sometimes an informal agreement takes place (tacit collusion). In this a dominant firm will set the price/output and other firms will then do the same. It is possible to identify specific factors which would favour collusion. These might include firms are likely to produce similar products using similar production methods; firms will be large, often with a dominant firm; there are significant barriers to entry; the market they operate in is usually stable; governments do not interfere.
Not all market structures are likely to fulfil these conditions. Firms operating in perfectly competitive markets are price takers and there are no barriers to entry. Firms operating in monopolistic competition are very small, they sell differentiated products and there are no barriers to entry. Monopoly firms, are large but by definition, do not face competition because they control all the market, so collusion would not be relevant. Oligopoly markets consist of a few large firms, which often produce similar types of goods and use barriers to entry. These factors would produce the ideal conditions to promote collusive behaviour. Therefore it is reasonable to agree with the view that collusion will only take place in an Oligopoly market.
It should be noted that although collusion can take place it does not automatically ensure that it will. Also, Oligopoly firms will still compete with each other through alternative means such as advertising and/or product differentiation. It should also be recognised that many cartel agreements break down because of cheating or one or more firms not fully sticking to the agreed rules.
L4 (9–13 marks) For a clear explanation what is meant by collusion. The key characteristics of a market which are necessary to enable firms to collude successfully should be identified. Each of the market structures should be discussed in relation to the possibility of collusion taking place. A conclusion which addresses the specific question should then be provided.

Discuss the role and importance of the commercial banks in a developed economy.
Key roles associated with commercial banks include: to allow the safekeeping of funds; to provide loans to consumers and producers; to act as financial intermediaries and make it easier for payments to be made within and between persons and firms.
Each of these roles can be linked to growth and development in a developed economy. Savings can be used to allow firms to borrow for investment purposes thus promoting long term economic growth. Loans can be also provided to consumers to promote an increase in consumer expenditure, increased aggregate demand and an increase in output and employment. Financial intermediation and easier methods of payment should promote specialisation and exchange thus further encouraging economic growth.
However it should also be noted that profitably is one of the main aims of a commercial bank and in some circumstances it is not clear that the needs of would- be investors are not consistent with the aims of a commercial bank. Banks have to maintain liquidity and security as well as profitability. Hence much needed loans to the private sector are not always available. In addition commercial bank loans create new bank deposits which automatically increase the money supply in an economy. In some situations this does not help a government to maintain an appropriate monetary policy. For example, a rapid increase in bank lending would be unwise when an economy is experiencing rising rates of inflation. A conclusion should summarise the preceding discussion.

The introduction of a national minimum wage by a government will always benefit employees at the expense of employers.
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement
Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to introduce a minimum wage. Aims might include: to protect basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage imposed above the existing market equilibrium. This analysis can then be linked to the specific statement in the question by considering why the effect of an increase in wages will be different, depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case. ‘always’ is a key word in the statement and it is assumed that candidates will question whether this is acceptable. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit the employer as well as the employee. Also references to possible positive/negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, higher minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living.

Interdependence is a key characteristic of oligopoly firms. This creates a problem regarding the pricing decisions made by such firms.
Explain this statement and discuss the extent to which game theory can help to solve this problem.
Answers should explain what economists mean by ‘interdependence’ in relation to an Oligopoly market structure. Oligopolies will be large firms with a high concentration ratio. This means that the pricing and output decisions of any one of these firms is likely to have a significant impact on profits, market share and growth of their main competitors.
One example might be illustrated by reference to the kinked demand curve and the link between price changes and changes in total revenue. This also emphasises the need to avoid price wars where all firms risk a fall in profits while the consumer benefits.
Game theory, which uses the idea of a maxi-min strategy and refers to the ‘Prisoners Dilemma’ as an example, can be used by an Oligopoly firm to promote the idea of collusion to choose a price which will maximise revenue. There are alternatives to this approach. For example, the market price may be set by the dominant firm while the remaining firms follow.
Tacit collusion might take place where the market price is set by ’rules of thumb’ such as average cost pricing. Thus although Game theory is undoubtedly useful to Oligopoly firms, there are a number of alternative approaches which might also be successfully adopted.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a response which explains the concept of interdependence in relation to the specific market structure of Oligopoly. The kinked demand curve should be used to illustrate the pricing problem. A clear analysis of the use of Game theory should be used to discuss a potential solution to this problem. At least one alternative pricing approach should be discussed. A conclusion should provide a judgement upon the specific statement under discussion.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent analysis of the importance of interdependence in relation to Oligopoly pricing, which incorporates the theory of the kinked demand curve and identifies why this constitutes a problem. An attempt might be made to explain Game theory but this will not be clearly identified as a solution to the specific problem. There will be no attempt to consider whether Game theory might represent the only solution.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a brief, descriptive approach which refers to interdependence and the kinked demand curve or interdependence and Game theory but does not attempt to link the three concepts to address the specific question

Discuss the extent to which monopoly producers and the consumers of their products might benefit from the existence of barriers to entry.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the state might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Potential benefits to the monopolist might include: higher profits; increase in efficiency; increase in market share; growth of the firm. The consumer benefits might include: lower prices; higher quality product; greater availability of a product.
Responses might refer to a range of alternative barriers to entry including: economies of scale; branding/advertising; legal requirements/patents; natural monopolies; limit pricing. Good responses will choose at least two types of barrier and discuss how each might have a positive/negative effect on both the producer and the consumer. For example, economies of scale might increase Monopoly profits by lowering unit costs but also benefit the consumer by possible subsequent price reductions. Similarly, the use of limit pricing to prevent new entrants might lower prices for the consumer in the short run but lead to a higher market share and higher profits in the long run.
On a more general note, some barriers might allow a monopolist to maintain profits in the long run and invest in research and development thus achieving dynamic efficiency. These benefits might by be passed on to the consumer through lower prices, higher quality products and more choice. Alternatively, barriers might lead to complacency and X inefficiency which is likely to lead to higher prices and lower quality products.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a clear, explanation of two barriers to entry and a discussion of how each of the barriers might have both a negative and positive effect on the producer and the consumer. An attempt should be made to summarize the extent to which producers/consumers might achieve a net benefit.

Discuss whether there is likely to be a conflict when a government attempts to fix exchange rates while at the same time introducing policies to decrease the level of inflation.
Governments can adopt a fixed exchange rate policy and maintain a fixed exchange rate in conjunction with direct intervention by a central bank in the foreign exchange market. If there is downward pressure on the external value of the domestic currency due to a balance of payments deficit, the central bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market by using its reserves of foreign currency to purchase domestic currency. This will prevent the fall in external value of the domestic currency. If the balance of payments is in surplus, the central bank will sell domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. If a government makes a formal announcement that it is going to fix the exchange rate at a lower rate, this is a de-valuation. Attempts to fix the currency at a higher rate would constitute a re-valuation. When exchange rates are fixed, the main instruments of monetary policy would be changes in interest rates and/or changes in the money supply.
However, if interest rates are raised to reduce aggregate monetary demand, to reduce the level of inflation, this will produce short term capital inflows which will put upward pressure on the domestic currency. To maintain the fixed exchange rate the central bank will sell the domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. This will increase the money supply which is likely to then make it more difficult to reduce the level of inflation. Thus it is likely that there will be a conflict when a government attempts to fix exchange rates and control inflation at the same time. Alternative approaches may use supply side policies which might reduce inflation without having a significant impact on the balance of payments. Although it is possible that such policies might still make exports more competitive and therefore still create problems maintaining fixed exchange rates.
L4 (9–13 marks) for a clear explanation of what is meant by fixed exchange rates and the process which is used by a government and central bank to achieve fixed rates. Alternative monetary policies used to reduce inflation should be explained. Analysis should then establish the link between antiinflationary policies and exchange rates which should also clearly identify why there might be potential conflict. A conclusion might consider possible approaches which might avoid the negative effects of this conflict.
L3 (7–8 marks) for a description of what is meant by fixed exchange rates and a consideration of alternative types of monetary policy. A link should be established between a fixed exchange rate policy and the success/failure of monetary policy but the analysis will not be full developed and there will be no attempt to consider possible solutions to this conflict.
L2 (5–6 marks) for a competent comment with the emphasis on describing what is meant by fixed exchange rates and explaining different monetary policy approaches. The link between monetary policy and fixed exchange rates will not be recognised and no attempt will be made to identify any potential conflict between these two policy approaches.

The government of a country sets an effective national minimum wage for workers.
Discuss the arguments for and against the government's decision.
Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to increase the minimum wage. Aims might include: to increase basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage, which will be different depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case. Potential benefits to the macro economy might be discussed. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit employers and the economy as a whole.
However, depending upon the type of market, referred to above, such a minimum wage might lead to significant job losses. Also, this policy might lead to a significant increase in government expenditure which might have to be financed by higher levels of taxation. Additional references to possible negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, a minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living. A conclusion should attempt to address the specific question based on preceding analysis.

Use indifference theory to analyse the view that the demand for an inferior good is likely to be more price inelastic than the demand for a normal good.
Candidates should recognise the assumptions which underpin indifference theory and how these assumptions relate to consumer desire to maximise satisfaction by buying a combination of goods which is consistent with consumer equilibrium. Explanation of a normal good should be provided. Analysis should then attempt to explain the impact of a change in price. This effect can be divided into a substitution effect and an income effect. Further price changes can then be used to construct the relationship between a change in price and a subsequent change in demand. This can be done using verbal description or by the use of accurately labelled diagrams plus relevant description. The link between indifference analysis, price change, a normal good and the shape of the demand curve should be clearly established.
A similar approach can be used i.e. using the relative impact of the substitution effect and income effect, to show the link between a price change, an inferior good and the shape of the demand curve. The overall effect on the elasticity of demand for each type of good should then be made by discussing the impact of the negative effect on the elasticity of demand for the inferior good. Verbal description and/or description plus diagrams would be acceptable. A conclusion should refer to the extent to which the view in question might be correct.
L4 (9–13 marks) for a response which uses indifference analysis to differentiate between a normal good and an inferior good. In each case the analysis should establish the link between price changes and their effect on the consumer's demand curve. This analysis should then be used to comment on the view in question. A conclusion should summarize the analysis and make some reference to alternative types of good.

The use of cars in large cities can cause traffic congestion and pollution.
Explain how the use of cars may cause allocative inefficiency and discuss two alternative government policies that might be used to solve this problem.
Allocative inefficiency occurs when a good/service is over/under produced which prevents an outcome which will maximize consumer satisfaction. Motor cars can cause traffic congestion and pollution which both contribute towards producing an allocatively inefficient outcome. Congestion is associated with slower transport/distribution and this causes inefficiency. Pollution produces negative externalities which are additional costs which are not incurred by the user of motor cars but which have to be borne by society in general. When these additional costs are not taken into account, more motor cars are produced, sold and used than would otherwise be the case, therefore allocative efficiency in relation to the amount of resources used to produce cars is not achieved.
There are a number of alternative government policies which can be used to address the overproduction of cars. Policies might include: taxation, legislation, regulation, advertising, subsidising alternative methods of transport. Each policy can be evaluated. For example, subsidising alternative forms of transport might be costly and the cross elasticity of demand for motor cars and alternative forms of transport might be very low.
L4 (9–13 marks) for a clear, explanation of allocative efficiency and the link between motor car use, traffic congestion, pollution, negative externalities and allocative inefficiency. Two government policies should be identified to address this problem and at least one evaluative comment in each case should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks) for an explanation of allocative efficiency and some attempt to link this concept to the negative impact of the use of motor cars on society. Some analysis will be provided which shows the relationship between allocative inefficiency and negative externalities. At least one government policy should be identified and its effectiveness discussed; or two policies with no evaluation.
L2 (5–6 marks) for a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of allocative efficiency but does not link this closely to negative externalities and the negative effects on society of the use of motor cars. Government intervention might be briefly referred to but not analysed or discussed.

This should be reflected by a conclusion which attempts to assess the validity of the view in question. L3 (7– 8 marks): For an accurate reference to the question and clear analysis explaining the relationship between monopsony and market failure and also trade unions and market failure but with a more limited evaluation or limited attempt to discuss the validity of the view under consideration.L2 (5– 6 marks): For a briefer analysis that examines two causes of labour market failure but does not use these differences to discuss the validity of the view under consideration.L1 (1– 4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Distinguish between the income and substitution effects of a change in a good’s price and analyse why the effect of a change in price is not always the same for different goods. A price fall is reflected in a change in the budget line (pivot from point on axis of the good with no price change) with a subsequent change in equilibrium. The equilibrium change involves substitution and income effects. Substitution effect would be in the opposite direction to the price change. The income effect is represented by a parallel shift of the budget line is in the same direction as the substitution effect for the normal good but in the opposite direction for an inferior and Giffen good.

They can be market oriented or through direct government intervention. Interventionist policies might include: education and training. Market policies might include taxation; reduction in unemployment benefits – these policies would aim to increase labour geographical/occupation mobility and enable specific focus on unemployment caused by changes in the pattern of demand.

1009,1009,discuss how this equilibrium might be affected by a government fiscal policy that raises taxes on goods. [13],"b
Taxes on goods would be likely to raise the price. A price rise of one or more goods is reflected in a change in the budget line (pivot from point on axis of good with no price change) with a subsequent change in equilibrium. The equilibrium change involves substitution and income effects. Substitution effect would be in the opposite direction to the price change. The income effect represented by a parallel shift of the budget line is in the same direction as the substitution effect for the normal good but in the opposite direction as the substitution effect for the inferior good. Candidates may analyse the effect of tax changes on the price of two goods.L4 (9–13) For a reasoned and clear discussion, logically presented dealing with income, substitution effects, normal, inferior goods.

Inferior goods would result in a different outcome when prices change from the outcome of a normal good, but they do not invalidate the underlying assumptions of the theory. Indifference curve theory can show more precisely why the difference occurs using income and substitution effects.
