Explain three causes of unemployment and consider which cause is likely to be most damaging to a high-income economy.
Follow the point-based marking guidance at the top of this mark scheme and award:up to 3 marks for AO1 Knowledge and understanding up to 3 marks for AO2 Analysisup to 2 marks for AO3 Evaluation.
AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)For a clear and accurate explanation of three causes of unemployment from frictional, structural, cyclical (demand deficient), seasonal or technological (3×1).
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks) Each cause identified must be analysed, and judgements made about how damaging it might be for a high-income economy (3×1). For example, points to consider may include:

Frictional unemployment may be dependent on information provision.
Structural unemployment may be permanent and difficult to solve.
Cyclical unemployment depends on the economic cycle.
Seasonal depends on alternative sources of employment.
Technological depends on occupational or geographical immobility of labour.

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks) For an answer that clearly assesses how damaging each cause may be to a high-income developed economy in comparison with each other (1) that leads to a justified conclusion as to which may be the most damaging (1).

Terms of trade is a measure of the relationship between export prices and import prices in an economy. By definition, a favourable movement or improvement is when export prices increase relative to a change in import prices. Import prices could fall while export prices remain unchanged.
A higher rate of inflation compared to that in trading partners will result in an increase in export prices and an improvement in the terms of trade.
A decline in the exchange rate results in a relative fall in export prices compared to trading partners. Terms of trade deteriorates.

A direct tax is one that is paid by individuals or businesses direct to the government. It is based on an individual’s income or on the profits of a business. Examples are income tax and profits tax. An indirect tax is so-called because it is not directly collected by the government-retailers and local government agencies are the main collectors. The tax is based on the purchase of products. Examples are GST or VAT and duties charged on sales of petrol, cigarettes and alcohol.
A direct tax is usually progressive, the rate of taxation increasing as income increases. Indirect taxes are regressive since they have to be paid irrespective of the income of the consumer.
The marginal rate of taxation is the proportion of extra income taken in tax. This will rise with a progressive tax thus increasing the burden on higher income groups. It will fall with a regressive tax thus increasing the burden on lower income groups. The average rate of tax refers to the proportion of income taken so for a progressive tax the marginal rate of taxation will be higher than the average rate of taxation and lower for a regressive tax.

Definition of PED: the measurement of the extent to which a change in price leads to a change in quantity demanded
Formula of PED: percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product divided by the percentage change in the price of a product.
Factors affecting PED:

the availability and price of substitutes: the market contains many firms and so PED for a particular brand of car is likely to be relatively elastic
the price of the product relative to income: the higher the relative proportion of income accounted for by a particular brand of car, the more elastic the PED is likely to be, although this could change over time as incomes rise
loyalty: if consumers have a strong loyalty to a particular brand of car, this will tend to make PED relatively inelastic
need or want: the degree to which a particular brand of car is seen as a necessity or a luxury
the time period: the PED for any particular brand of car is likely to increase over time, so it is more likely to be relatively elastic in the LR than in the SR

For application that explains what is meant by demand pull inflation (1 mark) an appropriate example of a cause (1 mark) duly explained why this is different to cost push inflation (1 mark)

8

Cost-push inflation is the outcome of a rise in the costs of production. This results in a shift to the left of the AS curve, increasing the price level. Possible causes could be an increase in wages above the rate of inflation, an increase in raw material costs or an increase in the price of fuel imports due to the depreciation of the currency
Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in aggregate demand not matched by an increase in aggregate supply. This will have a strong effect if the economy is at or close to the level of full employment. The cause could be an increase in government spending, a reduction in taxation leading to a consumer boom or an increase in demand for exports following a depreciation of the currency.

For a normal good, at a time when incomes are falling, demand will be expected to fall resulting in a shift to the left of the demand curve. For an inferior good, at a time when incomes are falling, demand will be expected to rise resulting in a shift to the right of the demand curve. This will result in a fall and rise respectively in the equilibrium price and quantity demanded which should be clearly shown on two separate diagrams as required by the question Do not reward application where one diagram is used to illustrate the effects on both types of goods.

Potential difficulties for a country:

a government will need to have sufficient reserves to intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the rate of the currency

A market is in equilibrium when, given present circumstances, there is no tendency for change. In other words demand and supply are equal with an equilibrium price and quantity. The market clears at this point. Disequilibrium will occur when either the demand curve or supply curve shifts. Change will have to come about to restore equilibrium. Equilibrium is restored through price changes or changes in demand and/or supply in the market. Accept maximum or minimum prices as a cause of disequilibrium.

Possible causes of a fall in the terms of trade include a fall in the price of China's exports or a rise in the price of China's imports. Candidates need to identify a possible cause and then provide a brief explanation of what might cause this. For example: • a fall in the value of China's currency will lead to a rise in the price of imports (1 mark) the fall in the exchange rate could be caused by falling interest rates in China (1 mark) • a reduction in the costs of production in China's export industries would lead to a fall in the price of China's exports (1 mark) this reduction in costs could be caused by an increase in export subsidies (1 mark) • a higher rate of inflation in China's trading partners would lead to the relative price of China's exports falling (1 mark) this higher rate of inflation in other countries could be caused by excess government spending in those countries (1 mark)

For knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise in the production process in a modern economy: Enterprise undertakes the organisation of the other factors of production (1 mark) It also bears the risk of production (1 mark)       (2 marks) For application: Profit is the reward to enterprise for its services (1 mark) In order to produce goods and services enterprise needs to hire labour which is rewarded with wages (1 mark), land which is the natural resource rewarded with rent (1 mark) and capital which is rewarded with interest (1 mark) Enterprise will utilise the other factors of production to produce goods and services that increase aggregate supply (1 mark). Aggregate supply will increase through an increase in productive potential or a fall in unused resources. (1 mark)        (Up to 6 marks)

Enterprise takes the risk of production and organises the other factors. In a modern economy this often leads to the divorce of ownership (shareholders) from control (management). Profit is the reward for enterprise, but profit is the reward for risk and in loss making firms there will be no profit. This contrasts with the rewards to labour, land and capital. Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period. In order to contribute to aggregate supply enterprise organises the other factors of production and takes the risk that costs will not exceed revenue leading to negative profit.

A market is in equilibrium when, given present circumstances, there is no tendency for change. In other words demand and supply are equal with an equilibrium price and quantity. The market clears at this point. Disequilibrium will occur when either the demand curve or supply curve shifts. Change will have to come about to restore equilibrium. Equilibrium is restored through price changes or changes in demand and/or supply in the market. Accept maximum or minimum prices as a cause of disequilibrium.

For knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise in the production process in a modern economy: Enterprise undertakes the organisation of the other factors of production (1 mark) It also bears the risk of production (1 mark)       (2 marks) For application: Profit is the reward to enterprise for its services (1 mark) In order to produce goods and services enterprise needs to hire labour which is rewarded with wages (1 mark), land which is the natural resource rewarded with rent (1 mark) and capital which is rewarded with interest (1 mark) Enterprise will utilise the other factors of production to produce goods and services that increase aggregate supply (1 mark). Aggregate supply will increase through an increase in productive potential or a fall in unused resources. (1 mark)        (Up to 6 marks)

Enterprise takes the risk of production and organises the other factors. In a modern economy this often leads to the divorce of ownership (shareholders) from control (management). Profit is the reward for enterprise, but profit is the reward for risk and in loss making firms there will be no profit. This contrasts with the rewards to labour, land and capital. Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given time period. In order to contribute to aggregate supply enterprise organises the other factors of production and takes the risk that costs will not exceed revenue leading to negative profit.

The factor enterprise has two roles in a market economy. One is taking the risk of production, the other is organising the other factors in the production process. The reward for contributing to production is profit. If there is a rise in the demand for a good in a market economy, its price will rise. The factor enterprise will respond by expanding production in pursuit of more profit. The quantity of goods in the market will expand along the industry supply curve. An 'accurate' diagram will have axes and curves labelled correctly, the shift in the demand curve will be correct and there will be an extension in the quantity supplied. In awarding marks for application allow Up to 3 marks for the diagram. One mark should be reserved for an explanation of the role of enterprise in allocating resources to the production of the good. Please note that some knowledge and understanding of the role of enterprise might be shown in the candidate's explanation of how enterprise responds to an increase in the demand for a good.

Equilibrium exists when there is no tendency to change. In the market for a good this will occur when demand equals supply.

Price elasticity of demand measures the response of demand to a change in price. An 'accurate explanation' will refer to relative % changes in price and quantity demanded e.g. in the case of goods that are relatively price elastic a % change in price will lead to a greater % change in quantity.If the candidate uses more vague terms to express the relationship between changes in price and changes in quantity demanded such as, 'price changes, and demand changes to a greater extent',then 1 mark maximum in each case.It must be clear that the candidate understands the relationship between % changes in price and % changes in quantity.Effective use of diagrams that explain the relationship between changes in price, the value of elasticity and changes in total revenue can be awarded 2 marks if it is clear that the candidate understands the concept of elastic/inelastic/unitary elastic.

When there is an improvement in technology the supply curve will shift to the right, this causes an excess supply and as a result, equilibrium market price will fall,and equilibrium quantity will rise.The candidate may provide two diagrams. One to show equilibrium price and quantity and one to show the impact of a shift in the supply curve to the right which results from the improvement in technology.It is possible however to show knowledge and understanding and application of the key points on one diagram. If clearly drawn and labelled this could be awarded the full 4 diagram marks.For a diagram to be considered 'accurate' it must have appropriate labels.To be awarded marks for the process that explains how equilibrium is re-established the candidate must explain that price falls because of an excess supply in the market and the fall in price leads to an extension or rise in equilibrium quantity demanded.

A private good has the characteristics of excludability and rivalry. This is normally achieved through the price mechanism and once a good is purchased, it cannot be consumed by others. Rivalry could also raise the price of a good. If a consumer does not have the resources,they cannot consume certain private goods. Public goods are provided to overcome this problem; they are nonexcludable and non-rival. Their provision does through raise the issue of free riders.

8
Public goods have the features of nonexcludabilty,non-rivalry in consumption. A motorway is often cited by candidates as apublic good, but consumers can be excluded from motorways through tolls and there is rivalry in consumption as traffic jams prove.If a candidate provides a reasoned argument that under some circumstances a motorway might be non-excludable and/or there is no rivalry in consumption this can be an acceptable approach. Some might argue that a motorway could be classified as a quasi-public good.Some candidates might refer to nonrejectability as a feature of public goods.Please allow credit for this if it adds to the general quality of the application.

8
The term deflation is used to describe aperiod in which there is a fall in the generalprice level. It is the opposite of inflation. Itis usually measured through falls in theCPI. There are a number of effects. For example, the value of savings increases.Consumers usually put off purchases hoping that prices will be lower in the future. This means that firms usually lower wages to preserve profits, but often they have to reduce production and this often causes unemployment. Investment also often declines. Although deflation is likely to lead to a fall in the terms of trade it may well result in an increase in revenues from exports. Also, the relative price of imports rises and this may result in lower import expenditures.

A freely floating exchange rate is determined by the free forces of the supply and demand for the currency in the foreign exchange market. A high rate of inflation could lead to a decline in the exchange rate because the goods and services produced by an economy become uncompetitive. The demand for the currency falls as the demand for exports fall and the supply of the currency rises as imports rise as their relative price falls.
