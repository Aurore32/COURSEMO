A government's decision to move from a fixed exchange rate system to allow free market floating exchange rates will solve the problem of unemployment in the short run but will cause higher rates of inflation in the long run. Evaluate this statement.
Governments in conjunction with central banks can fix exchange rates by buying and selling the domestic currency. Floating exchange rates are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. If unemployment is rising, there are different policy options available to governments. For example, lowering interest rates might stimulate aggregate demand which will increase output and employment. Lower interest rates however will put a downward pressure on a fixed exchange rate. In response, the central bank will either have to sell pounds or increase interest rates.
Both options will undermine policies to increase employment. If a government allows exchange rates to float freely based on market forces, a reduction in interest rates will lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency. In this case lower rates will stimulate domestic demand such as consumption/investment expenditure plus a lower value of the domestic currency will further increase demand for exports. Therefore, low interest rate policies are more likely to be successful under a floating rate system. However, it should be noted that this policy is likely to be more successful when addressing the problem of cyclical unemployment rather than other types such as structural or frictional unemployment.
Also, a freely floating currency which is allowed to depreciate will have some potential inflationary effects in the long run. For example, a depreciating currency will lead to a higher cost of imports and possible cost push inflation. In addition, a switch from fixed to floating exchange rates will mean that the central bank exchange rate policy will no longer have complete control over the money supply. This might be inflationary in the long run. The extent to which inflation might rise in the long run will also be determined by other factors, for example global expansion, rising commodity prices etc.

Developing economies have a high proportion of economically inactive people relative to the size of the labour force ( a high dependency ratio). This is the main reason why the standard of living is low in developing economies. 
Evaluate this statement.
A dependency ratio indicates the extent to which the working population has to produce not only enough goods and services to sustain itself but also for the rest of the population who do not work and depend upon those who do. Dependency ratios might be high for different reasons. Some economies have a disproportionately large number of young people under the age of 15 who are economically dependent. Some economies have high dependency ratios due to a disproportionately large number of people who are too old to work. Developing economies have high dependency ratios primarily due to very high birth rates. This will have a negative impact on living standards due to the insufficient wealth creation to enable everyone in the population to have access to food, shelter, education, health care etc. A smaller working population will also pay insufficient tax to allow governments to invest in necessary public and merit goods.
However, there are many additional factors which also contribute to low living standards in developing economies, for example, reliance on primary products, low levels of capital investment, insufficient access to training and education, limited natural resources. Also it should be recognised that it is extremely difficult to measure living standards. GDP per capita is commonly used but this omits many important factors which might impact on living standards. Based on the above, it is difficult to accept with any degree of certainty that high dependency ratios are the main reason why the standard of living is low in developing economies.
L4 (18–25 marks): For a response which explains what is meant by dependency ratio and why this ratio might be high in developing countries. Discussion will focus upon the link between a high dependency ratio and low living standards. Problems associated with defining standard of living should then be linked back to the specific question. A conclusion which addresses the specific question should then be provided.

Analysis of the links between a high dependency ration and living standards in an developing economy will be limited. There will be no attempt to question how we define living standards in the context of the specific question.

Some reference to the link between a high dependency ratio and a developing economy will be made. A brief reference to the impact on living standards may also be made but the response will lack any in-depth analysis or evaluative comment.

Question
Answer
Marks


7

A government's decision to increase its budget deficit as a proportion of the economy's GDP will depend significantly upon whether the economy's output gap is positive or negative. 
With the help of a diagram explain and evaluate this statement. 
Answers should explain that a budget deficit will occur when government total expenditure is greater than its total income. It should also be recognised that a decision to increase a budget deficit as a proportion of a country's GDP, is likely to inject additional expenditure into an economy. On this basis this policy would be expansionary, in that it has been introduced to increase expenditure, income, output and employment.
An output gap will be positive can be explained in different ways. One approach states that a positive output gap will occur when actual output is above the level of the trend output. Alternative approaches might use production possibility curves or aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis. Each of these approaches can be explained using a diagram. Each approach should recognise that a positive output gap is associated with an economy that is overheating or undergoing inflationary pressure. A negative output gap can be explained using the same three approaches outlined above. In each of these cases an economy will not be using all its resources and is likely to be in recession. Based on the above it is clear that a government is highly unlikely to increase its budget deficit if the economy is experiencing a positive output gap. Diagrams could be used to show that such a policy in such circumstances is highly likely to lead to high levels of inflation. 
However, an increase in a budget deficit is likely to stimulate the output and employment when the output gap is negative. A diagram could be used to show the potential impact of such a policy. Evaluative comment might note that the extent of positive effect of an increase budget deficit will depend upon the cause of the output gap. It will be less effective if the gap is caused by structural unemployment rather than cyclical unemployment. Also, the use of large budget deficits to close a negative income gap might create additional problems such as high interest rates (crowding out), high inflation in the long run, or negative effects on the balance of payments.
L4 (18–25 marks) For an answer which explains what is meant by a budget deficit and how an increase in this deficit might impact on key macroeconomic variables. A clear explanation of positive and negative output gaps with supporting diagrams should be provided. The impact of a deficit with respect to each gap should be analysed. The potential beneficial effects of an increase in the deficit on a negative output gap should then be evaluated. L3 (14–17 marks) For clear analysis which uses a diagram to explain each type of output gap. The focus will show how an increase in a budget deficit as a proportion of GDP might affect a negative output gap. There will be no attempt to evaluate the extent to which the negative output gap might be closed. L2 (10–13 marks) For a less well-developed comment which describes the meaning of a budget deficit and both types of output gap. Diagrams provided might not be clearly labelled and the link between a negative output gap and a budget deficit will not be analysed in detail.

5,Explain what economists mean by an increase in real GDP per capita and discuss the extent to which an increase in real GDP per capita will have a positive impact on economic development. [25],"


Question
Answer

Explain what economists mean by an increase in real GDP per capita and discuss the extent to which an increase in real GDP per capita will have a positive impact on economic development. 
GDP is measured by the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy in a particular time period, usually one year. To ensure that an accurate measure of the real output is attained with we have to take account of the price element of the change in value of goods. By taking inflation into account we can calculate the real value of GDP. It is also helpful to calculate the relationship between this increase in real value of GDP and any change in population. Economists will divide the real GDP by the total population to calculate the amount of GDP that is available per person. This would now allow economists to calculate real GDP per capita. An increase in real GDP per capita is consistent with the achievement of economic growth. This potentially allows the population access to more goods and services and this is often associated with an increase in living standards.
However, economic development considers a much wider range of variables than economic growth and many of these variables are more difficult to measure accurately. Economic development attempts to measure the improvement in the overall quality of life enjoyed by the population. Key measures of development include access to education; access to health care; life expectancy; lower levels of poverty. An increase in real GDP per capita might have a positive impact on economic development because more resources will be available to provide better education, better access to health care and a subsequent increase in life expectancy. However, an increase in GDP per capita might a have a negative impact on economic development for reasons which might include negative effects on the environment; loss of leisure time; further inequalities in the distribution of wealth; unsustainable growth due to overuse of scare resources.
L4 (18–25 marks) For a clear explanation of real GDP per capita. Economic development will be clearly defined and at least two positive links between an increase in real GDP per capita and economic development established and analysed. At least two potential negative impacts on development will be identified and discussed and a conclusion will be provided.

6,Explain what is meant by cost benefit analysis and consider how it might be used by a government to decide whether a new hospital should be built. [25],"


Question
Answer
Marks

Explain what is meant by cost benefit analysis and consider how it might be used by a government to decide whether a new hospital should be built. 
The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to consider negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits. In many cases the provision of certain types of good will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value of benefits that might be gained from a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice. 
The type of analysis outlined above would be particularly useful when considering whether to build a new hospital. Hospitals are huge capital projects; they are extremely costly and the associated benefits are only likely to be gained over a long time period. As well as private costs there are likely to be negative externalities, for example, effect on the local wildlife, increased traffic congestion around the hospital. Also there will be positive externalities, for example easier access to health care for local residents, more jobs for doctors and nurses, local multiplier effects associated with building and maintaining the hospital. When all the costs and benefits have been considered, a government has to decide whether the net benefit justifies the decision by comparing this with the opportunity cost. It should be recognised that it is very difficult to put a monetary value on externalities and to estimate the future benefits in real terms i.e. allowing for inflation.
L4 (18–25 marks) For a reasoned and clear discussion which analyses and explains the key characteristics of cost benefit analysis. This analysis should then be applied to explain government decision making, in this case whether to build a new hospital. Evaluative comment should refer to at least two problems associated with using this type of decision making. L3 (14–17 marks) For a competent analysis which clearly explains how cost benefit can be used to aid a government when deciding whether to build a new hospital. At least one evaluative comment should be provided which illustrates a difficulty associated with the use of such analysis. L2 (10–13 marks) For a descriptive explanation of cost benefit analysis but there will be little attempt to link this analysis to consider the government's decision whether to build a new hospital. No specific problems associated with the use of this analysis will be identified. L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Keynesians argue that increasing budget deficits will solve the problem of unemployment. Monetarists argue that supply side policies are more effective in reducing unemployment. 
Consider which view is more likely to be correct.
Candidates should explain that a budget deficit will occur when government total expenditure is greater than its total income. It should also be explained that unemployment is considered to be a problem primarily because it represents a waste of valuable scarce resources. 
Keynesians argue that an increased budget deficit will create additional expenditure/aggregate monetary demand which, in conjunction with the multiplier effect, will lead to an increase in output, income and employment. However, monetarists suggest that this approach might not be effective because: additional borrowing due to a budget deficit will lead to higher interest rates, lower investment and a countervailing fall in monetary demand; alternatively monetarists suggest it the financing of the deficit depends upon printing new money, this will ultimately lead to inflation; that it is the cause of unemployment which matters and Keynesian solutions would not be helpful regarding structural unemployment caused by changes in the pattern of demand and/or frictions in the labour market. 
Therefore monetarists would argue that supply side policies, either based on direct government intervention, for example reducing corporation tax or by interfering with the price mechanism to reduce frictions in the labour market. For example introducing de-regulation and promoting privatisation. An attempt should be made to summarize the preceding argument and recognising that a key difference between the two approaches is closely linked to the type of unemployment under consideration. 
L4 (18–25 marks): For an answer which explains what is meant by a budget deficit and which recognizes why unemployment constitutes a significant economic problem. Analysis of both the Keynesian and Monetarist proposed solutions will be provided. Analysis in both cases should be subject to at least one evaluative comment.

A budget deficit and the reason why unemployment will also be explained in the process. However, there will be little evidence of evaluative comment with respect to either approach.

Question
Answer
Marks


5

With the help of a circular flow diagram discuss how a policy of export led growth might affect the standard of living in a developing economy. 
Export led growth is dependent on an outward growth strategy which relies heavily on openness and increased international trade. Successful growth should lead to an increase in national income, output and employment.
Concentration on the expansion of exports should be a key factor determining an increase in aggregate demand, output and employment. This can be clearly illustrated, using a circular flow diagram which shows all withdrawals, all injections and the change in national income equilibrium achievable via export led economic growth. This diagram should be clearly labelled and accurate showing an increase in injections (exports) producing a bigger increase in output/income/employment via the multiplier .These increases should lead to a real increase in GDP per capita which should provide the potential for a rise in living standards by increasing access to more goods and services. 
However, a developing economy is likely to rely heavily on the export of primary goods for which it would have a comparative advantage. The demand for such goods is likely to be income inelastic and the supply of such goods will be volatile because supply of such goods will vary significantly dependent upon changes in the weather. This means that changes in the growth rate might not be significant and the subsequent impact on the standard of living much reduced. Also it should be recognised that an increase in output, income and employment might not necessarily result in a significant increase in living standards. For example, it would depend upon how the additional income is distributed, possible loss of leisure time, might lead to lower long term economic growth due to focus on production and sale of primary products. 
L4 (18–25 marks): For a sound explanation of how export led growth can be analysed using an accurately labelled circular flow diagram. Links between the export led growth and potential benefits on the standard of living in developing countries should be clearly established. Evaluative comment should then be provided which questions the extent of the beneficial impact of this type of growth on the standard of living in a developing economy. A conclusion should be provided.

Similarly, a brief, undeveloped conclusion might be provided.

A circular flow diagram will not be provided and there will be only a very limited attempt to link export led growth to changes in the standard of living in developing countries.

Question
Answer
Marks


6

Government policies which rely on increasing budget deficits to solve the problem of unemployment will not be successful because they do not affect the natural rate of unemployment. 
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Budget deficits used to solve the problem of unemployment are generally associated with Keynesian demand management policies. This policy approach is adopted to address the specific problem of cyclical unemployment where there is insufficient aggregate monetary demand in an economy. A budget deficit will produce net government spending which, in conjunction with the multiplier effect of this spending can lead to an increase in monetary demand which will solve the problem of cyclical unemployment. At this point it is assumed that the labour market is in equilibrium. However, natural unemployment relates to those workers who remain unemployed even though the labour market is in equilibrium. This is primarily due to market frictions on the labour market which lead to frictional and structural unemployment. In this situation, policies which rely upon budget deficits stimulating aggregate demand are unlikely to be successful. 
Alternative policies which focus upon the supply of labour are more appropriate. For example, Trade Union reform, reducing taxes on profits, subsidising new growth industries, might be used. Therefore, to some extent the statement in question is correct. It should however be also noted that increasing budget deficits might still fail to solve the problem of unemployment regardless of the impact of the natural rate of unemployment. For example, a budget deficit might lead to higher interest rates which might have a negative effect on investment, aggregate demand and employment. In addition, a budget deficit might lead to an increase in the money supply which might cause inflation and the further loss of jobs in the long run. A conclusion should refer to the above which suggests that the statement in question is only partially correct.

Many developing countries rely heavily on the production and export of primary products. This is the main cause of low levels of economic growth in developing countries and therefore the main explanation for the low standard of living in these countries. 
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. 
Candidates should address three elements of this question. First, it is true that many developing countries do rely heavily on the production and export of primary goods. The nature of this type of good usually means that demand for exports is likely to be inelastic because food is essential and the supply of primary goods is likely to fluctuate considerably due to changes in the weather causing significant changes in both market prices and changes in income. This reliance on the production of primary goods plus relatively small secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary sectors has to be the main source of economic growth. The relatively low level of economic growth is primarily due to low levels of investment and low levels of productivity in the primary sector. Low growth may also be caused by low levels of savings associated with low levels of income in the primary sector which make it difficult for the financial system to provide sufficient funding for capital investment. 
Nevertheless, it should be recognised that there are other factors which might contribution to low growth rates in developing countries. For example, low levels of investment in training and education. The third part of the response should question the relationship between a low level of economic growth and a low standard of living in developing countries. It should be pointed out that sometimes high growth rates might lead to a fall in living standards, for example the effect of negative externalities. Also living standards are not measured entirely upon the availability of goods and services and this can be illustrated by referring to other measures of living standards which do not focus on economic growth. A conclusion might discuss the extent to which each part of the statement can be supported by the preceding analysis. 
L4 (18–25 marks) for a sound explanation of why the relationship between primary goods and opportunities to achieve economic growth. At least one example of the link between the export of primary goods and a low rate of economic growth. Some evaluative comment should be made in relation to the extent to which rates of economic growth can be used to indicate changes in the standard of living. A conclusion should be provided. 
L3 (14–17 marks) for a clear analysis of the potential impact of export led growth on an undeveloped economy. An attempt will be made to show why this growth might be difficult to attain. Some attempt might be made to discuss the overall impact of export growth on living standards but points raised will be brief and not fully developed.

There will be only a very limited attempt to explain why export led growth based on primary products might be difficult. Links between growth and changes in the standard of living in developing countries will not be developed.

'In developing economies an increase in GDP determines an increase in the standard of living. Foreign direct investment (FDI) will produce an increase in GDP therefore governments in undeveloped economies should encourage FDI.' How far do you agree with this statement?The statement contains three related parts; each part should be explained and discussed; links between each part should then be examined. For example, the link between an increase in GDP and the standard of living is subject to debate. The strengths/weaknesses of this link should therefore be discussed in the light of this debate. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) should be explained, and some analysis provided to decide the extent to which an increase in FDI might produce an increase in GDP. A range of costs/benefits associated with FDI might be considered. Alternative approaches by undeveloped countries to FDI, which might also lead to an increase in economic growth and living standards, might be discussed. Based on the above analysis and evaluative comment, a conclusion should be provided which attempts to decide how far it is possible to agree with the statement under consideration. L4 (18–25 marks): For a response which addresses each of the three parts of the statement. Analytical plus evaluative comment should be provided which assesses the extent to which the claims in the statement can be justified.

Question
Answer
Marks

'The cause and extent of market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure under consideration.'Discuss this statement. Market failure can be divided into two main areas. One area would link market failure to the type of good in consideration. This would include: merit goods, demerit goods and public goods. Alternatively market failure can also be linked to different types of market structure which would include: monopolistic competition, oligopoly and monopoly. All cases of market failure will be closely related to allocative and productive inefficiency. Candidates should begin by attempting to discuss the extent to which market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure. Evidence should be provided which shows that some market structures, for example Monopoly can clearly be associated with market failure, in that equilibrium output in this type of market frequently produces both allocative inefficiency and X inefficiency. Similar conclusions might also be linked to other types of imperfect markets. However, it should also be recognised that positive and negative externalities associated respectively with merit and demerit good will also produce allocatively inefficient outcomes. Public goods might also be discussed in that their unique characteristics will lead to non-provision in a free market due to the free rider problem. Based on the above, a conclusion should be provided which questions the validity of the statement in its entirety. L4 (18 ̶ 25 marks): For a reasoned and clear discussion that identifies at least two types of market failure and discusses this using at least two types of market structure and two types of good or service. Analysis of the links will be combined with some evaluative comment relating to whether the cause of market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure under consideration. A reasoned conclusion should be provided. Must mention efficiency to access L4 21 maximum if no conclusion. L3 (14 ̶ 17 marks): For a developed comment together with limited analysis of different market structures and different types of product. There should be some discussion but the evaluation will not focus on whether market failure depends entirely upon the type of market structure under consideration. L2 (10 ̶ 13 marks): For a brief explanation but weak or ill-explained links. The explanation will be undeveloped with some attempt at analysis but the emphasis will be on descriptive comment and the key element of the question will not be addressed. L1 (1 ̶ 9 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Question
Answer 
Marks


5
‘Wage differentials can be explained by economic theory. They are a sign of the power of a firm to exploit its workforce and are unjust.’  Do you agree with this view?  The question presents an assertion. Candidates should discuss whether the theory does explain differentials in wage rates, and comment on the conclusion presented. Candidates should consider what is meant by ‘differential’. Is it different wages for the same job between people with the same experience or different wages for different jobs, or different levels of experience? It is likely that in imperfect competition (monopsony) wage rates may be lower than in perfect competition, but the differential might also be due to differences in supply and in the shape of the MRP curve. Differentials may also be due to differences in private/public sector pay and possible political issues in fixing wage rates. L4 (18–25 marks) For a thorough analysis of theoretical wage determination, a clear discussion about the meaning of differential, and consideration of what might cause differentials in wages. There are three parts to consider: whether wage differentials can be explained by the theory, whether they are the result of the power of the firm and whether they are unjust, Expect a comment on all three parts. L3 (14–17 marks) For a competent explanation of wage theory but with a weaker use of the analysis. There will be a more limited discussion of the meaning of differential. Expect a comment about two of the parts of the question. L2 (10–13 marks) For a correct but undeveloped descriptive approach with scant comment on the meaning of differential and a comment about only one of the parts of the statement.  L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Explanation of meaning of efficiency and explanation of the analysis which ensures an efficient optimum may be reached. Productive efficiency makes the best use of resources, and allocative efficiency ensures that no one can be made better off without someone being worse off. Individual actions are not always best for society as a whole. Discussion of reasons for market failure and necessity/desirability of government intervention to achieve efficiency. This could be by persuasion (nudge theory) rather than by enforcement. Nudge theory, originally an ethical idea not a government manipulative tool, involves designing choices to encourage decision making in wider positive interests of society. But it can be used in government context. Government intervention may thus be necessary, but it need not overcome inefficiency as there may be inefficiency in government through lack of information.L4 (18–25 marks): for a thorough explanation dealing with productive and allocative efficiency and a comment on the importance of both concepts; and an accurate discussion of market failure, with examples and a conclusion about the need for government intervention and whether such intervention is a sufficient solution.L3 (14–17 marks): for a competent but less developed explanation of the terms with accurate but limited comment on the importance.

The statement refers to developed and developing economies and some performance indicators. Candidates should clearly explain the difference between these terms. Answers should also recognise the links between developed and developing economies and the indicators. It should be recognised that although key performance indicators might be similar, it is often for different reasons and these reasons should be explained.

Analysis of difference between perfect competitive factor markets and imperfectly competitive markets. Wages may be increased by unions in imperfect markets without decreasing unemployment as long as it doesn't rise above point where mc=mr. This still leaves the firm with abnormal profit. Beyond this point, higher wages will result in a decrease in employment.

A detailed explanation of Keynesian demand management theory and how associated policies might be used to solve the problem of unemployment. Evaluative comment should be provided to consider whether such policies are likely to work. Candidates should ensure that they discuss the extent towhich these polices will conflict with the attainment of other key macroeconomic goals.

A clear explanation of the export-led growth hypothesis should be provided. Alternative ways of achieving growth should be explained and the difference between achieving growth by internal means should be clearly established. The main part of the discussion should relate to specific problems that might face developing economies which attempt to achieve export-led growth. This should be compared with the costs and benefits of stimulating growth internally using policies to promote direct investment carried out by multinational companies.L4 (18–25) for an answer that evaluates the relative success of each type of policy by using a cost/benefit approach in each case. It is important to recognise the specific conditions required for success in each case and the extent to which this is likely to be achieved in an developing economy. Aclear comparison should be in evidence and a conclusion provided based upon the preceding discussion.

68,"The UK Government has established a behavioural insight team known as the ‘nudge unit,’ which attempts to change consumer behaviour by persuasion.
Explain how indifference curve theory predicts a consumer will react to changes in income and changes in the price of a product in order to maximise satisfaction. Consider whether the use of ‘nudge’ theory (persuasion) conflicts with this theory of maximising satisfaction.   [25]","


Question 
Answer 
Marks 


2

Theory states that consumers maximise satisfaction by relating utility to price; this is shown by indifference curves and budget lines. Income changes shift budget lines parallel; price change of one good causes a budget line to pivot. Equilibrium is changed – the extent and direction depending on the type of good. Nudge theory seeks to persuade. It could be represented by a change in perceptions or taste shown by the shape of the indifference curve. It does not invalidate the notion of equilibrium andmaximising satisfaction according to the new shape of the curve. 
L4 (18–25) for a clear analysis of ICs and an explanation of income and price changes, a link between nudge theory and with a concluding paragraph.
L3 (14–17) for a clear analysis of either price or income changes or a weaker analysis of both but still with an attempt to consider the link to nudge theory, although not so conclusively.
