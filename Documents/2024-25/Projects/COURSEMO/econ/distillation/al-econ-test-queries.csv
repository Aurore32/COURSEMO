        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             


        Question: Discuss whether a contractionary monetary policy is the best way to reduce the rate of inflation. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Discuss whether a contractionary monetary policy is the best way to reduce the rate of inflation. [12],"b

Discuss whether a contractionary monetary policy is the best way to reduce the rate of inflation.
For analysis that considers the advantages and disadvantages of using monetary policy to reduce the rate of inflation (up to 4 marks with a max of 3 if only advantages or disadvantages are analysed)
For analysis that considers the advantages and disadvantages of at least one other policy to reduce the rate of inflation (up to 4 marks per policy with a max of 3 if only advantages or disadvantages are analysed)
For evaluation that considers which is the best way to reduce the rate of inflation (3 marks) to reach a justified conclusion as to which is the best way (1 mark)

Monetary policy involves measures that influence the price or quantity of money. These include interest rates and the money supply. In some countries exchange rate policy is included. Interest rate changes though have tended to be the main policy used to control the rate of inflation in most countries. In theory, an increase in the rate of interest should encourage more saving by consumers and less funding for investment by businesses. If effective, an increase in interest rates should reduce the rate of inflation.
Fiscal policy can also be used. This involves increasing taxation or reducing government spending to reduce inflation. Both measures are at the cost of increasing the level of unemployment. Supply side policies are also possible, especially if there are structural weaknesses in an economy.
There are no marks awarded in part b for merely explaining / defining terms or phrases within the question.

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Protectionism can take different forms in different countries.Discuss whether export subsidies are always a better method of protectionism than tariffs. [12],"b

Protectionism can take different forms in different countries.
Discuss whether export subsidies are always a better method of protectionism than tariffs.
Analysis:Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of export subsidies as a method of protectionism. (Up to 4 marks)Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of tariffs as a method ofprotectionism. (Up to 4 marks)8 marks maximum
Evaluation:For exercising some judgement on whether export subsidies are always a better method of protectionism than tariffs. (Up to 4 marks)Reserve 1 mark for a conclusion4 marks maximum

Advantages of export subsidies:

subsidies to domestic producers will allow firms to lower cost and price and undercut foreign competition
difficult for the WTO to deal with as they are not an overt method of protectionism

Disadvantages of export subsidies:

they involve an opportunity cost in terms of other areas that a government could have spent the money on
industries become too dependent on the subsidy rather than trying to become more competitive

Advantages of tariffs:

a tariff is a tax or duty on import goods making them more expensive and less competitive
if the demand for imports is elastic, demand should fall
the government can use tariffs as a source of revenue

Disadvantages of tariffs:

they will not be successful if demand for imports is price inelastic
they may lead to retaliation

There are no KU marks awarded in (b) for merely defining/explaining terms used within the question

            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             


        Question: Assess whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Assess whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive. [12],"b

Assess whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis andTable B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative contentResponses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

The positive consequences of economic growth: an improvement in the standard of living, a reduction in the rate of unemployment, an increase in incomes, an increase in the level of aggregate demand, a possible reduction in income inequality, higher tax revenues which a government could spend on improving public services (such as education and healthcare), and an increase in business confidence leading to greater investment.
The negative consequences of economic growth: a possible depletion of non-renewable natural resources and damage to the environment, such as through various types of pollution, an unequal sharing of the benefits of economic growth among a population leading to an increase in income inequality and a possible reduction in the quality of life of people through longer working hours and a reduction in the amount of leisure time, plus a shift towards more capital-intensive production. Answers may also refer to the dangers of inflationary pressure.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.
AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:

The degree to which the potential benefits of economic growth are equally shared among a population.
The extent to which any shift towards more capital- intensive production affects the level of unemployment
Whether long-term economic growth brings about a short-term cost as resources are used to produce capital goods rather than consumer goods
The extent to which the economic growth is sustainable
Which leads to a justified conclusion on whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive

A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:

        Question: Discuss the extent to which the introduction of a maximum price in a market will benefit consumers. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Discuss the extent to which the introduction of a maximum price in a market will benefit consumers. [12],"b

Discuss the extent to which the introduction of a maximum price in a market will benefit consumers.
For analysis of how the introduction of a maximum price in a market may benefit consumers. (Up to 4 marks)
For analysis of how the introduction of a maximum price in a market may not be of benefit to consumers. (Up to 4 marks)
For evaluation that clearly considers the extent to which consumers may benefit from the introduction of a maximum price in a market (up to 3 marks) that leads to a reasoned conclusion (1 mark)

12

The purpose of maximum price legislation is to ensure that consumers get access to supplies of essential products such as various types of food and in some cases, water and power supplies. It may also free up income to purchase other essential items. To be effective the maximum price must be below the equilibrium price in a free market, and this may be referred to in the first part of the analysis. An accurate diagram should not be expected but would enhance the quality of the analysis.
However, the problem with a maximum price is that demand invariably exceeds supply at this price. Shortages can occur and this can lead to an informal market and profiteering along with rationing and queuing. Consumers may end up paying even more than the equilibrium price to get the supplies they need.

        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

The effect of direct provision of goods and services by the government: • does it prevent the price mechanism from rationing? • does it prevent the price mechanism from signalling? • does it prevent the price mechanism from transmitting preferences? The direct provision of goods and services by the government will be financed through the tax system, e.g. education and health care, and so will not be allocated through a price mechanism. However, education and health care can also be provided through a price mechanism and in this situation the mechanism can function as a rationing and signalling device and as a way of transmitting preferences

Assess whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis andTable B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative contentResponses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

The positive consequences of economic growth: an improvement in the standard of living, a reduction in the rate of unemployment, an increase in incomes, an increase in the level of aggregate demand, a possible reduction in income inequality, higher tax revenues which a government could spend on improving public services (such as education and healthcare), and an increase in business confidence leading to greater investment.
The negative consequences of economic growth: a possible depletion of non-renewable natural resources and damage to the environment, such as through various types of pollution, an unequal sharing of the benefits of economic growth among a population leading to an increase in income inequality and a possible reduction in the quality of life of people through longer working hours and a reduction in the amount of leisure time, plus a shift towards more capital-intensive production. Answers may also refer to the dangers of inflationary pressure.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.
AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:

The degree to which the potential benefits of economic growth are equally shared among a population.
The extent to which any shift towards more capital- intensive production affects the level of unemployment
Whether long-term economic growth brings about a short-term cost as resources are used to produce capital goods rather than consumer goods
The extent to which the economic growth is sustainable
Which leads to a justified conclusion on whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive

A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.

Indicative content
Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

NO: Explanations of why market economies should remain as they are e.g., because there is no (or minimal) government intervention, decisions are taken on the basis of demand and supply, competition is encouraged and so production is more efficient, and consumers and producers act on their own self-interest.
YES: Explanations of why market economies should become mixed economies e.g., because in a market economy there is non-provision of public goods, the under-consumption of merit goods, the overconsumption of demerit goods and the existence of markets where prices are too low, too high, or too unstable.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.
AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation of whether all market economies should become mixed economies leading to a justified conclusion.
Points to consider may include whether governments should provide public goods, merit goods, reduce the provision of demerit goods, intervene in the price mechanism etc.

            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

Potential usefulness of PED: • it can be helpful in giving a business an indication of the extent to which a change in price may affect revenue • this will show that to increase revenue, the price of an elastic good should be reduced and the price of an inelastic good should be increased • however, to be able to make appropriate calculations, a businessman will need to take into account the availability of substitutes, the width of the definition of the product, the amount spent on the product and the time period under considerationPotential usefulness of PES: • it can be helpful in giving a business an indication of the extent to which a change in the price of a product can lead to a change in the quantity supplied of a product • it can help a business to make decisions about how much stock to hold • it can help a business decide on the extent of spare capacity to provide for • it can help a business decide on the factors of production it is going to needNote: No marks for KU of PED and PES

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").

        Question: Assess whether an increase in investment in new infrastructure projects will always have a positive impact on the circular flow of income in an economy. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Assess whether an increase in investment in new infrastructure projects will always have a positive impact on the circular flow of income in an economy. [12],"b

Assess whether an increase in investment in new infrastructure projects will always have a positive impact on the circular flow of income in an economy.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative content
Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis (max 8 marks)Increased investment in new infrastructure can have a positive and negative impact on the circular flow of income in an economy:

Increased investment can be from firms or government
Household savings can be a source of funds for this investment
Investment is an injection in to the circular flow of income
There is increased payments for factors of production
Households supply factor services to firms in the form of labour, enterprise and capital
In turn, firms provide factor services to implement the investment
Leakages impact on the total flow of funds in the circular flow of income
Taxation on the inputs into the new infrastructure project is a leakage from households and firms to the government
Other leakages are spending on imports of materials to implement the new infrastructure project
Household savings are a leakage from factor income
Equilibrium in the circular flow will depend on the balance between injections and leakages.

AO3 Evaluation (max 4 marks)

The circular flow model is a simplified view of reality.
The impact will depend upon the net of injections and leakages.
There could be a negative impact on the circular flow of income ifleakages exceed injections.
Most forms of new infrastructure have a negative impact not taken intoaccount by the model
Consideration as to whether all new infrastructure always has a positiveimpact on the circular flow of income

Accept all valid responses.
A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.

        Question: Discuss whether the principle of comparative advantage concludes that a movement to free trade will always result in an overall benefit for an economy. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Discuss whether the principle of comparative advantage concludes that a movement to free trade will always result in an overall benefit for an economy. [12],"b
Discuss whether the principle of comparative advantage concludes that a movement to free trade will always result in an overall benefit for an economy. For analysis that explains how the principle of comparative advantage justifies free trade in terms of an increase in overall output/consumption possibilities that will benefit an economy/ies (up to 4 marks) For analysis that suggests why the shortcomings of the principle of comparative advantage might make it less useful and therefore free trade might not be beneficial for an economy/ies (up to 4 marks) 8 marks maximum For evaluative comment that assesses the relative strengths of each approach (up to 3 marks) And leads to a reasoned conclusion whether the principle of comparative advantage does suggest that a movement to free trade will always result in an overall benefit for an economy (1 mark) 4 marks maximum
12
The analysis here needs to show how free trade can lead to overall benefit for an economy but also that this might not be the case Several approaches are acceptable: some might argue that transport costs might negate the benefits of trade or that the exchange rate is not favourable. Others might argue that a movement to free trade might lead to structural adjustments that bring costs to the economy. Some might argue that as specialisation takes place resources are re-allocated and opportunity costs might riseCandidates may suggest reasons for protectionism as a counter argument – this is also acceptableNote: there are no KU marks awarded in part (b) for merely explaining/defining terms or phrases used within the question

Assess whether the improved provision of information is likely to be the best method to reduce the consumption of demerit goods
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis andTable B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative content
Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

The meaning of improved provision of information
How improved information would reduce the consumption of demerit goods; consumers are aware of the ‘true’ costs from consuming demerit goods and respond by reducing their demand – this may include a shift to the left of the demand curve, or a shift to left of the MPC curve
An explanation of the limitations of improved information – habitual consumption, peer pressure, irrational behaviour
An explanation of an alternative policy – taxation, minimum prices, regulation backed by fines.

AO3 Evaluation

Consideration that fully assesses the relative effectiveness of the policies analysed in reducing the consumption of demerit goods and arrives at a reasoned conclusion concerning whether improved provision of information is the ‘best’ approach.

Accept all valid responses.

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

        ",Discuss the ways in which fiscal policy can be used to increase the aggregate supply of products in an economy and consider whether this approach is likely to be effective. [12],"b
Discuss the ways in which fiscal policy can be used to increase the aggregate supply of products in an economy and consider whether this approach is likely to be effective. For analysis that considers how changes in taxation can influence aggregate supply with reference to the difficulties associated with this approach. For an analysis of how changes in taxation might work without the possible difficulties (3 max). (Up to 4 marks) For analysis that considers how changes in government spending can influence aggregate supply with reference to the difficulties associated with this approach. For an analysis of how changes in government spending might work without the possible difficulties (3 max). (Up to 4 marks)                 8 marks maximumFor evaluation that fully assesses the effectiveness of these approaches in increasing aggregate supply of products in an economy (up to 3 marks) and arrives at a reasoned conclusion concerning whether fiscal policy is likely to be effective. (1 mark)

Cuts in income and business taxes may provide incentives and increase the supply of labour and entrepreneurship to the economy. The difficulty is that they might not stimulate these resources. In addition, this could lead to a budget deficit and possible inflation. Increases in government spending could be directed to improving labour skills. Subsidies would also be included in this category encouraging for e.g., investment in R & D. This could also lead to a budget deficit and may take some time before this comes to fruition. A comparison of fiscal policy with another policy may be relevant within the evaluation but is not relevant analysis.

                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

The transition to a market economy will represent a movement towards consumer sovereignty. If there is imperfect information however there will be an underproduction of merit goods and an overproduction of demerit goods. Candidates are required to consider the advantages and disadvantages of a market economy and then to exercise some judgement about whether the transition will always be better for consumers. Reverse arguments should not be rewarded twice.

Assess whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis andTable B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative contentResponses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

The positive consequences of economic growth: an improvement in the standard of living, a reduction in the rate of unemployment, an increase in incomes, an increase in the level of aggregate demand, a possible reduction in income inequality, higher tax revenues which a government could spend on improving public services (such as education and healthcare), and an increase in business confidence leading to greater investment.
The negative consequences of economic growth: a possible depletion of non-renewable natural resources and damage to the environment, such as through various types of pollution, an unequal sharing of the benefits of economic growth among a population leading to an increase in income inequality and a possible reduction in the quality of life of people through longer working hours and a reduction in the amount of leisure time, plus a shift towards more capital-intensive production. Answers may also refer to the dangers of inflationary pressure.

A one-sided response can only gain a maximum of Level 2.
AO3 Evaluation
Points to consider may include:

The degree to which the potential benefits of economic growth are equally shared among a population.
The extent to which any shift towards more capital- intensive production affects the level of unemployment
Whether long-term economic growth brings about a short-term cost as resources are used to produce capital goods rather than consumer goods
The extent to which the economic growth is sustainable
Which leads to a justified conclusion on whether the consequences of economic growth for an economy are always positive

A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.
Accept all valid responses.

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

Monetary policy can be used to correct inflation in an economy by:

an increase in interest rates
a reduction in the money supply

Cost-push inflation: an appreciation of a currency would lower import prices of finished products and raw materials/component parts Demand-pull inflation: an increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in the money supply would reduce aggregate demand and appreciate the currency Evaluation: appropriate reference to elasticities, the J-curve effect and the Marshall-Lerner condition

        Question: Discuss whether a government should use monetary policy or fiscal policy to solve the problem of deflation in an economy. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Discuss whether a government should use monetary policy or fiscal policy to solve the problem of deflation in an economy. [12],"b
Discuss whether you would advise a government to use monetary policy or fiscal policy to solve the problem of deflation in an economy. For analysis that explains how monetary policy can be used to stimulate aggregate demand with due reference to the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Maximum 3 marks if only strengths or weaknesses are explained (up to 4 marks) For analysis that explains how fiscal policy can be used to stimulate aggregate demand with due reference to the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Maximum 3 marks if only strengths or weaknesses are explained (up to 4 marks) And for evaluation that clearly compares the use of each policy to solve the problem of deflation (3 marks) that leads to a reasoned conclusion as to which policy may be the most appropriate (1 mark)
12
Monetary policy can include exchange rate policy and should be rewarded. The evaluation here should compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and arrive at a conclusion based upon this assessment. If a candidate gets MP and FP the wrong way around throughout their response then award a max of [1 + 1] marks for an understanding of both economic policy instruments. A response such as this should be recorded as [1 + 1 + 0] in the text box. There are no KU marks awarded in part (b) for merely explaining / defining terms or phrases within the question

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             


        Question: Discuss the difficulties that businesses might have when they try to control the factors that determine the price elasticity of demand for a product and consider whether attempts to control these factors are likely to be successful. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Discuss the difficulties that businesses might have when they try to control the factors that determine the price elasticity of demand for a product and consider whether attempts to control these factors are likely to be successful. [12],"b

Discuss the difficulties that businesses might have when they try to control the factors that determine the price elasticity of demand for a product and consider whether attempts to control these factors are likely to be successful.
For analysis that considers the difficulties a business might have in attempting to control a factor that influences the price elasticity of demand. (Up to 4 marks per factor analysed) (8 marks maximum)
For evaluation that considers whether the difficulties in controlling the factors can be overcome (3 marks) and arriving at a reasoned conclusion (1 mark)

12

Factors include whether the good is a necessity, whether it is habit forming, the availability, attractiveness of substitutes, the proportion of income taken in the purchase of the good, and the time period.
Responses that simply explain the factors that determine PeD without any references to the difficulties that business might have in controlling these factors should not be rewarded.
Candidates must consider at least two factors to score full marks for analysis or they can consider more than two factors and their difficulties in less depth.
There are no KU marks awarded in part b for merely explaining / defining terms or phrases within the question.

        Question: Discuss whether knowledge of price elasticity of demand or income elasticity of demand would be of greater use to a business that produces cars. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Discuss whether knowledge of price elasticity of demand or income elasticity of demand would be of greater use to a business that produces cars. [12],"b

Discuss whether knowledge of price elasticity of demand or income elasticity of demand would be of greater use to a business that produces cars.
For Analysis: Analysis of the usefulness of knowledge of the price elasticity of demand to a business that produces cars. (Up to 4 marks) Analysis of the usefulness of knowledge of the income elasticity of demand to a business that produces cars. (Up to 4 marks) 8 marks maximum
For Evaluation: For exercising some judgement on whether knowledge of price elasticity of demand or income elasticity of demand would be of greater use to a business that produces cars.(Up to 4 marks) Reserve 1 mark for a conclusion 4 marks maximum

12

The usefulness of knowledge of price elasticity of demand:

the business will be able to predict the effect of a change in the price of a car on demand reasonably accurately
if demand is price elastic, a fall in price will lead to an increase in revenue
if demand is price inelastic, a fall in price leads to a decrease in revenue
if PED is unitary elastic, a change in price will not lead to a change in revenue

The usefulness of knowledge of the income elasticity of demand:

the business will benefit from knowing about the effect of changes in income in an economy, e.g. as incomes increase, production can shift from a basic car
knowledge of YED will enable the business to plan for the future, e.g. having the resources to meet demand
increases in income in an economy may lead the business to produce better and more luxurious cars with more features and functions (luxuries have a YED of more than 1 and so the business will be able to know whether to produce more luxury goods)

Discuss whether the direct provision of goods and services by the government prevents the price mechanism from working effectively. For Analysis Analysis of the prevention of the price mechanism from working effectively.  (Up to 4 marks) Analysis of the potential fact that it does not prevent the price mechanism from working effectively.

The effect of direct provision of goods and services by the government: • does it prevent the price mechanism from rationing? • does it prevent the price mechanism from signalling? • does it prevent the price mechanism from transmitting preferences? The direct provision of goods and services by the government will be financed through the tax system, e.g. education and health care, and so will not be allocated through a price mechanism. However, education and health care can also be provided through a price mechanism and in this situation the mechanism can function as a rationing and signalling device and as a way of transmitting preferences

                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

An economy is experiencing a fall in average incomes during a severe recession. Discuss the extent to which the concepts of income elasticity of demand and price elasticity of demand might be useful to an entrepreneur in this economy and consider which would be more useful. For analysis that explains the usefulness of income elasticity of demand to an entrepreneur when incomes are falling. (Up to 4 marks) For analysis that explains the usefulness of price elasticity of demand to an entrepreneur when incomes are falling (Up to 4 marks)And for evaluation that clearly compares the usefulness of each concept (3 marks) that leads to a reasoned conclusion as to which is the most useful (1 mark)
12
Income elasticity of demand would be useful to an entrepreneur because it would indicate those goods that are likely to experience a decrease in demand and those that should experience a rise in demand i.e. normal goods and inferior goods respectively Price elasticity of demand will inform an entrepreneur of the possibility of changing prices to increase revenue. The estimates might be used by an entrepreneur or firms for sales forecasting, investment decisions, production planning, location and new markets. There are no KU marks awarded in part (b) for merely explaining/ defining terms or phrases within the question

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)

        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.

        Question: Assess whether an increase in investment in new infrastructure projects will always have a positive impact on the circular flow of income in an economy. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 12 marks
        ",Assess whether an increase in investment in new infrastructure projects will always have a positive impact on the circular flow of income in an economy. [12],"b

Assess whether an increase in investment in new infrastructure projects will always have a positive impact on the circular flow of income in an economy.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and Table B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 8 marks. AO3 out of 4 marks.
Indicative content
Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis (max 8 marks)Increased investment in new infrastructure can have a positive and negative impact on the circular flow of income in an economy:

Increased investment can be from firms or government
Household savings can be a source of funds for this investment
Investment is an injection in to the circular flow of income
There is increased payments for factors of production
Households supply factor services to firms in the form of labour, enterprise and capital
In turn, firms provide factor services to implement the investment
Leakages impact on the total flow of funds in the circular flow of income
Taxation on the inputs into the new infrastructure project is a leakage from households and firms to the government
Other leakages are spending on imports of materials to implement the new infrastructure project
Household savings are a leakage from factor income
Equilibrium in the circular flow will depend on the balance between injections and leakages.

AO3 Evaluation (max 4 marks)

The circular flow model is a simplified view of reality.
The impact will depend upon the net of injections and leakages.
There could be a negative impact on the circular flow of income ifleakages exceed injections.
Most forms of new infrastructure have a negative impact not taken intoaccount by the model
Consideration as to whether all new infrastructure always has a positiveimpact on the circular flow of income

Accept all valid responses.
A one-sided response cannot gain any marks for evaluation.

                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.

The meaning of the terms PED/PES
How PED estimates would be useful to business owners –it would indicate the likely changes to revenue in response to changes in the price of a product.
An explanation of the limitations of PED estimates – does not consider the prices of complements/substitutes; income level of the consumer; trends; ignores the relevance of costs so changes to profits are uncertain.
An explanation of how PES estimates would be useful to business owners - the potential to invest in spare capacity which can be used if demand rises; increase overtime payments to increase production; whether or not to outsource to other firms who can meet supply.
An explanation of the limitations of PES estimates – e.g., practical ability to increase the PES; the associated costs in making supply more elastic/responsive.

AO3 Evaluation

Consideration that fully assesses the relative effectiveness of both PED/PES estimates and their implications for business decision-making and arrives at a reasoned conclusion concerning which concept (or otherwise) is most useful.

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 12-mark AS-Level structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:
        - The question will ask you to assess a statement, meaning you have to give a balanced overview on reasons why the statement is true and why it might not be true.
        - Your answer will be in three paragraphs.
        Part 1: First two paragraphs. Analysis. Roughly 600 words. (Worth 8 marks.)

            - The first two paragraphs will be two paragraphs that analyze the given statement in detail. 
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss two policies (e.g. ""Assess whether supply-side policy is the best policy for ensuring long-term economic growth""). In this case, you should write one paragraph on one policy and another paragraph on another policy, like fiscal policy.
                    - If your two paragraphs are each on a different policy, you will need to include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of **both** policies in detail. Put the advantages and disadvantages of one policy in one paragraph.
                - Some questions will explicitly ask you to compare two things (e.g. ""Assess whether PED is more useful than XED for farmers."") In this case, the first paragraph should be on the first thing mentioned and the second paragraph should be on the second thing mentioned.
                - Some questions will ask you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a single thing (e.g. ""Discuss the benefits and harms of a free market system."")
                    - No need to include any other things; one paragraph will be on the benefits of that thing, and the other on its harms.
                - The contents of the two paragraphs may differ, but you should always write two paragraphs.
            - How to structure each paragraph:
                - A detailed definition and explanation of the keywords for the topic of that paragraph (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is a policy measure that involves either a change in tax rates or a change in levels of government spending..."")
                    - If the paragraph is about a policy measure, this should include the definition for the policy, the instruments of that policy (e.g. interest rates / exchange rates etc.), and a complete chain of cause-and-effect on how it works, in economic analysis (e.g. lowering interest rates -> cost of borrowing reduced -> more people borrow -> disposable income increases -> consumption increases -> AD shifts to the right)
                    - If the paragraph is about an economic concept (e.g. a market economy, a command economy, PED, XED etc.), include the definition of the concept, a full explanation of what it is (e.g. the formula for PED), and examples to explain it.
                - A detailed discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or both (if necessary) of the topic being discussed.
                    - Each advantage/disadvantage will include:
                        - A clear statement of the point.
                        - A chain of cause-and-effect explaining the advantage/disadvantage. (e.g. ""Fiscal policy is dangerous because it can cause inflation. Fiscal policy shifts AD to the right, which when unaccompanied by a rightward shift in the AS raises both real output and price level. A sustained increase in the price level leads to inflation, which can erode the purchasing powers of consumers over time and reduce consumer confidence in the economy; this will eventually make economic growth unsustainable, as increased output cannot be matched by consumers' purchasing powers, making consumption lag behind."")
                - Diagrams should be drawn accompanying the analysis wherever relevant.
                - DO NOT use any concepts that are not in the AS-Level syllabus. DO NOT draw from real-world evidence or information.
                        
        Part 2: Evaluation. Last paragraph. Roughly 250 words. (Worth 4 marks.)
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - For instance, consider the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
            - This is only worth 4 marks, so you will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end:
                - ""In conclusion, ... is the best policy for ensuring long term economic growth but only if ..., ... and ... (put in your evaluation points)"".

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).

        Question: Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.
An economist said that the most effective intervention a government can make in the housing market is to relax the planning system and make it easier and cheaper to build more homes. Increased supply, leading to lower prices, would encourage demand. Others said that ‘although there is talk of a large rise in the price of houses, it is not uniform throughout the country and trying to influence the basic laws of supply and demand is not the right way of tackling the problem.’
The buying of housing gives rise to increased consumer spending and some argue that this helps the economy. Although policies by the government and the central bank had increased consumer demand and spending, such expenditure is quite different from the export-led growth model preferred by the government. Analysts suggested that the demand and supply conditions causing the current situation cannot last forever. When they end, the effect on the housing market (which by then will have many people with very high debts) will be very bad for the economy. This can be seen in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where property values are in decline.

It was thought to be an improvement because it would increase in demand, increase in growth, wealth effect, employment and incomes. Simple linkage e.g. demand increases leads to economic growth (max 3 +2 for further elaboration.)

        Question: Public services – better or worse? 
A government usually has macroeconomic policy aims that it hopes will enable some success in raising the quality of life, or well-being, of the population. In doing this the government also hopes to achieve efficiency in the use of resources.
Efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs. Inputs are relatively easy to count: they are financial costs of public services. Output can also be counted, but it is not necessarily a good measure of the outcome. The outcome is much harder to calculate. It is broader and more subjective – how do we assess whether a public service is 'better' or 'worse'?
This is where a knowledge of well-being makes an enormous difference. It could provide a much clearer view of the trade-offs that have to be made in allocating taxpayers' money to public services. Take the example of healthcare. To maximise the impact of expenditure on well-being, the budget may need to be adjusted to give more to mental health services and less to building general hospitals. For older people it could mean giving priority to programmes that would keep them out of hospital. 
A focus on well-being should lead to better outcomes. This is where policymakers need a better understanding of behavioural economics. Governments have established Behavioural Insights teams, or Nudge Units. They have had some success. A small change in the wording of a letter to people who owed tax demonstrated how more behaviourally sensitive language sped up payments. The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.
Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

The article says that 'efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs'. Is this how economic theory states that efficiency is determined? [5]

The article says that 'efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs'. Is this how economic theory states that efficiency is determined?  Partly it is for productive efficiency – cost against output; not really the case for allocative efficiency.

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

Analyse whether there is any evidence that the market structure for New York taxis could be called a monopoly. Characteristic/definition of monopoly (1) Before 2011 entry restricted for yellow taxis by licence system. After 2011 entry restricted for competitor firms by limiting number of other types of taxis and preventing them picking up passengers in central area. These are types of barrier to entry; they support the idea of a monopoly. (up to 3) But there are competitors, apart from other taxis there is the metro, private cars and independent taxi owners. This does not support the idea of a monopoly. (up to 2) Max 5 overall.

        Question: The economic impacts of the increasing use of all-electric cars
Some governments have agreed targets to reduce air pollution and, as part of this, are concerned about the social costs caused by the use of petrol and diesel vehicles. In response, car manufacturers are producing all-electric cars. The sales of these are increasing, especially in developed countries. The success of this switch to all-electric cars will depend on improving both battery technology as well as building an infrastructure in which, as drivers reduce their use of fossil fuels, electricity charging points will replace petrol pumps.
Fig. 1.1 shows the cumulative number of all-electric cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Fig. 1.2 shows the annual sales of all cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Some forecasters predict that about one third of the world’s cars will be all-electric by 2040. Their forecasts are based on the assumption that the costs of batteries to run these cars will have declined steeply from their present levels. Battery costs are dependent on supplies of various metals which are used as component parts. Supplies of these metals are finite and their prices, linked to mining costs, will be crucial in increasing the scale of all-electric car production.
In 2016, the cost of the batteries was 49% of the total cost of the car. In 2017 it was stated at a New Energy conference in Shanghai that battery prices would need to drop by more than half before all-electric cars would become competitive with cars powered by petrol and diesel engines. 
Oil producers claim that growth in sales of all-electric cars will not substantially reduce world demand for oil. The world needs oil for much more than just cars. Cars account for only about a fifth of the 95 million barrels the world consumes every day. Most of the rest is used in industry or to fuel heavy goods vehicles, aircraft and ships, which do not have easy non-oil alternatives. In developing economies, petrol sales are expected to continue rising because these countries do not have the infrastructure or sufficient capital investment to enable the switch to electric vehicles.

Use the information to discuss what might happen to the long-run average cost of producing batteries for all-electric cars.

Falling LRAC depends on economies of scale. LRAC comprises AFC and AVC [2].
Output of electric cars is expected to rise significantly in the long run. As output rises, AFC may well fall because of economies of scale in production [1]
However, unless battery technology changes, AVC are likely to rise eventually. Batteries are a large component of the cost, and their manufacture depends on finite supplies of component metals. As demand increases, prices will rise as mineral reserves become depleted. This could counteract possible reductions in AFC. [2]

        Question: Sustainable electricityThe UK government favoured the production of cheap, sustainable electricity and subsidised the large companies that operate wind farms. The wind farms cost a lot to build and maintain. However,as the wind is free, the companies pay nothing for fuel and can sell electricity at very low prices –when the wind is blowing. This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms. Expensive electricity production has driven industries abroad which has resulted in a loss of income and jobs. By 2020 it is estimated that small businesses will be paying 77% more per unit for electricity. The poor and the elderly have been hit hardest by high electricity bills. Some say that the support of wind farms has caused the destruction of landscapes.Source: The Times, 9 November 2015Sustainable agricultureIn Africa,industrial methods of agriculture deplete the soil,pollute water tables and fail to benefit small-scale farmers.Agro-ecological methods – aimed at producing food without damaging natural resources – are by contrast more sustainable for the farmers and more nutritious for consumers.Advocates say these methods are profitable for small-scale farmers and more productive with high yields and cheap inputs.They say 'we need to develop local markets, create local diversity and increase the capacity of local economies'.Using them could have a huge effect on the 70% of Africans that rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.This was endorsed by a conference in Mali in 2015.Even large commercial farms are starting to adopt the agro-ecological methods. Currently,six companies supply 60% of the world's commercial seed market and 11 companies supply 98% of the world's pesticide market.

        Question: Public services – better or worse? 
A government usually has macroeconomic policy aims that it hopes will enable some success in raising the quality of life, or well-being, of the population. In doing this the government also hopes to achieve efficiency in the use of resources.
Efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs. Inputs are relatively easy to count: they are financial costs of public services. Output can also be counted, but it is not necessarily a good measure of the outcome. The outcome is much harder to calculate. It is broader and more subjective – how do we assess whether a public service is 'better' or 'worse'?
This is where a knowledge of well-being makes an enormous difference. It could provide a much clearer view of the trade-offs that have to be made in allocating taxpayers' money to public services. Take the example of healthcare. To maximise the impact of expenditure on well-being, the budget may need to be adjusted to give more to mental health services and less to building general hospitals. For older people it could mean giving priority to programmes that would keep them out of hospital. 
A focus on well-being should lead to better outcomes. This is where policymakers need a better understanding of behavioural economics. Governments have established Behavioural Insights teams, or Nudge Units. They have had some success. A small change in the wording of a letter to people who owed tax demonstrated how more behaviourally sensitive language sped up payments. The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.
Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

The article says that 'efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs'. Is this how economic theory states that efficiency is determined? [5]","c
The article says that 'efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs'. Is this how economic theory states that efficiency is determined?  Partly it is for productive efficiency – cost against output; not really the case for allocative efficiency.

        Question: Sustainable electricityThe UK government favoured the production of cheap, sustainable electricity and subsidised the large companies that operate wind farms. The wind farms cost a lot to build and maintain. However,as the wind is free, the companies pay nothing for fuel and can sell electricity at very low prices –when the wind is blowing. This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms. Expensive electricity production has driven industries abroad which has resulted in a loss of income and jobs. By 2020 it is estimated that small businesses will be paying 77% more per unit for electricity. The poor and the elderly have been hit hardest by high electricity bills.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts. [5]

Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts.
Evidence from the article for the effectiveness of using loyalty cards:

loyalty cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions (1)
retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through loyalty cards. (1)

In contrast to that the article says:

price is not the most significant factor in determining choice (1)
there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit or has low emotional involvement. (1)

Conclusion: there does seem to be some conflicting evidence. (1)

        Question: Airport Expansion
In 2014, a proposal by Heathrow Airport Authority (HAA) in London recommended building an extra runway at Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. HAA acknowledged that it was an initial proposal that needed more detailed work.
They claimed that, if built, the runway would deliver greater economic benefits and be a better option for economic growth for the UK than any other proposal for new airport capacity. HAA was not able to quantify the benefits with any precision but said they would range from £50 billion to £156 billion (US$84 billion to US$262 billion) with a ‘central estimate’ of over £100 billion (US$168 billion). The majority would benefit the wider economy by creating jobs, encouraging trade, boosting spending and improving public finances. The proposal would allow the airport to be connected to more emerging markets and enable 40 new destinations to be served directly, including some in India and China. Cargo volumes would double and UK competitiveness would increase.
HAA added that more efficient vehicles, an increased proportion of passengers travelling by public transport and new aircraft technology would mean that the extra flights would not exceed the European Union pollution limits.
In order to build the new runway, major motorways would need to be altered. Many homes would have to be demolished but the airport said they would pay the owners 25% above the property’s market value. When it was built, car drivers wishing to take passengers to the airport would have to pay a congestion charge.
Those opposing the new runway said that thousands of people would be forced out of their homes and communities would be destroyed and, while waiting for a decision to be made, they would be unable to sell their homes. 240 000 people would suffer from airport noise.
HAA said the runway would cost £15.6 billion (US$26.2 billion) to build, with the government paying £1.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) towards the motorway alterations.
There were alternative proposals. The first was to build a completely new airport to the east of Heathrow. The second was to add another runway to an existing airport, Gatwick, to the south of Heathrow.
HAA argued that a completely new airport would take much longer to build and be more expensive than an extra runway and would mean higher fares for passengers.
The owners of Gatwick Airport insisted that the new runway at Heathrow was not in the best interest of passengers and that Gatwick would be better able to offer lower fares and connect to emerging markets with longer-range aircraft. They said that their plans were cheaper – £7.8 billion (US$13.1 billion) – and could be built quicker than the Heathrow option, with less disruption to motorways. Noise from another runway at Gatwick would also affect fewer people – 14 000, not 240 000.

Airport infrastructure is privately owned and makes money for its owners. Consider why in thiscase the government would pay £1.2 billion towards the cost of motorway alterations. [5]

This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices. Further, the incentives and marketing discounts used by the scheme are often thought to be confusing and make it more difficult for the consumer to compare prices. There are risks for retailers too. It requires substantial investment to run such a scheme – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. 
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? The relative importance of factors that influence consumers when choosing from which shop to buy groceries are one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies who have invested in card schemes use them as a means to gather data on customers. When the loyalty card is used the retailer can see what the customer prefers to buy and can direct future offers to their wants in specific promotions both on-line and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers' wants. 
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. However, many purchases are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts. [5]

Evidence for the effectiveness of cards:• Cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions;• Article also says retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through cards. (2)In contrast to that it also says• Price is not most significant factor in determining choice;• Also there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit, or has low emotional involvement. (2)Conclusion: seems to be some conflict. (1)

        Question: Divergences in economic performance
A report considered the determinants of long-term economic growth and rated economies on their global competitiveness using an index from 7 to 1. Labour productivity is one influence on the competitiveness of an economy and labour productivity also determines the level of prosperity that a country can achieve. Switzerland, Singapore and the United States (US) were the world’s three most competitive economies (see Table 1.1). Countries in the Euro Area were also ranked in the report. The Euro Area is a monetary union of 19 countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

        Question: Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

        Question: Well-being and economic growth
For many years governments have sought to deal with economic performance with policies and tools based on the assumption that consumers would act rationally in response to incentives or sanctions. They have also operated public sector services assuming that the best outcome is achieved through the power of government to regulate, tax and spend.  
The tools the government uses are designed to influence consumer demand, often with the aim of increasing economic growth and GDP. But economic growth does not guarantee rising prosperity and well-being, as illustrated by Table 1.1 that compares HDI and GDP of selected countries. 
Ideally, all major investment projects in the public sector should require a cost-benefit analysis. This assesses the wider effects of projects. The project may have different effects on a poorer group than on a wealthy group. For example, a poorer group may gain considerably more benefit, or well-being, from a government grant than a richer group.
Some economies have tried to influence economic growth by using an expansionary monetary policy. In some countries this has meant that bank interest rates have been kept very low. It was hoped that this would encourage investment and borrowing and increase spending. Recently there has been some pressure to raise interest rates. But raising interest rates is not always wise. 
Higher interest rates could be justified in an economy experiencing economic growth, falling unemployment and an increase in business investment with the result that there are fewer unused resources in the economy. 
Against that, higher interest rates could decrease consumer spending and also result in a decrease in investment. This may mean no increase in real wages. It could suggest interest rates should stay low.

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

        Question: French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

Identify what caused the rise in the electricity prices and explain whether it can be concluded from the article that the price rise was an example of market failure.
Natural gas supply shortage (1) breakdown of nuclear reactors (1). Market failure occurs when price mechanism fails to account for all of the costs and benefits necessary to determine price equilibrium and this results in allocative inefficiency (accept alternative definitions of market failure) (2). There is no evidence of allocative inefficiency and no market failure (accept either) (1).

        Question: Divergences in economic performance
A report considered the determinants of long-term economic growth and rated economies on their global competitiveness using an index from 7 to 1. Labour productivity is one influence on the competitiveness of an economy and labour productivity also determines the level of prosperity that a country can achieve. Switzerland, Singapore and the United States (US) were the world’s three most competitive economies (see Table 1.1). Countries in the Euro Area were also ranked in the report. The Euro Area is a monetary union of 19 countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

        Question: Infrastructure is restricting Indonesia's economic development
One feature of Indonesia's economy that has been hampering its economic and social development is the lack of quality and quantity of its infrastructure, whether it is 'hard' like roads or 'soft' like education.
In recent years the Indonesian government has given infrastructure a relatively small allocation of public spending. In 2011 only 2.1% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was reserved for infrastructure. In comparison, countries such as China and India spend almost 10% of their GDP on infrastructure. Since the late 1990s expansion of Indonesia’s infrastructure has not matched macroeconomic expansion, and as a consequence economic growth has not reached its full potential. It is estimated that GDP could grow at 1%–2.5% more than the current annual rate.
Lack of adequate infrastructure causes distribution costs such as transport and warehousing to rise steeply, thus reducing Indonesia's competitiveness and attractiveness as an investment location. According to data published by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin Indonesia), around 17% of a typical company's total expenditure is absorbed by such costs. In other south-east Asian economies this is below 10%. In particular transport costs are high; by land as well as sea. Despite Indonesia's island geography, sea transport is yet to be developed substantially. Currently, sea transport is even more expensive than land transport. This results in inflationary pressures on domestically produced products. It partly explains why some domestically grown fruit is more expensive than imported fruit. It also leads to substantial regional price differences. Rice, for example, is much more expensive in eastern Indonesia than in Java or Sumatra. It also prevents businesses from expanding and profitable opportunities are lost.
Indonesia suffers from inadequacies in the country's electricity supply, despite the abundance of energy resources. Part of the problem is that the state-owned electricity distributor, which has a monopoly on electricity distribution, is heavily dependent on government subsidies as the cost of production is higher than the fixed maximum selling price.
Soft infrastructure such as education, healthcare and social welfare is also under-developed. The government has made efforts to improve these areas in recent years. A new healthcare system is about to be introduced covering all Indonesians and spending on education has increased markedly.

Indonesia suffers from inadequacies in the country's electricity supply, despite the abundance of energy resources. Part of the problem is that the state-owned electricity distributor, which has a monopoly on electricity distribution, is heavily dependent on government subsidies as the cost of production is higher than the fixed maximum selling price.
Soft infrastructure such as education, healthcare and social welfare is also under-developed. The government has made efforts to improve these areas in recent years. A new healthcare system is about to be introduced covering all Indonesians and spending on education has increased markedly.

        Question: Increasing public sector debt is a good policy
Politicians do not usually think it a success to borrow a large amount of money but, in June 2020, when the economy was approaching a recession, the United Kingdom (UK) borrowed five times as much as it did in June 2019. This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.

Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.
There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession. 
The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.
However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

        Question: Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.
An economist said that the most effective intervention a government can make in the housing market is to relax the planning system and make it easier and cheaper to build more homes. Increased supply, leading to lower prices, would encourage demand. Others said that ‘although there is talk of a large rise in the price of houses, it is not uniform throughout the country and trying to influence the basic laws of supply and demand is not the right way of tackling the problem.’
The buying of housing gives rise to increased consumer spending and some argue that this helps the economy. Although policies by the government and the central bank had increased consumer demand and spending, such expenditure is quite different from the export-led growth model preferred by the government. Analysts suggested that the demand and supply conditions causing the current situation cannot last forever. When they end, the effect on the housing market (which by then will have many people with very high debts) will be very bad for the economy. This can be seen in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where property values are in decline.

A report considered the determinants of long-term economic growth and rated economies on their global competitiveness using an index from 7 to 1. Labour productivity is one influence on the competitiveness of an economy and labour productivity also determines the level of prosperity that a country can achieve. Switzerland, Singapore and the United States (US) were the world’s three most competitive economies (see Table 1.1). Countries in the Euro Area were also ranked in the report. The Euro Area is a monetary union of 19 countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices. Further, the incentives and marketing discounts used by the scheme are often thought to be confusing and make it more difficult for the consumer to compare prices. There are risks for retailers too. It requires substantial investment to run such a scheme – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. 
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? The relative importance of factors that influence consumers when choosing from which shop to buy groceries are one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies who have invested in card schemes use them as a means to gather data on customers. When the loyalty card is used the retailer can see what the customer prefers to buy and can direct future offers to their wants in specific promotions both on-line and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers' wants. 
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. However, many purchases are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts. [5]

Evidence for the effectiveness of cards:• Cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions;• Article also says retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through cards. (2)In contrast to that it also says• Price is not most significant factor in determining choice;• Also there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit, or has low emotional involvement.

        Question: Sustainable electricityThe UK government favoured the production of cheap, sustainable electricity and subsidised the large companies that operate wind farms. The wind farms cost a lot to build and maintain. However,as the wind is free, the companies pay nothing for fuel and can sell electricity at very low prices –when the wind is blowing. This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms. Expensive electricity production has driven industries abroad which has resulted in a loss of income and jobs. By 2020 it is estimated that small businesses will be paying 77% more per unit for electricity. The poor and the elderly have been hit hardest by high electricity bills. Some say that the support of wind farms has caused the destruction of landscapes.Source: The Times, 9 November 2015Sustainable agricultureIn Africa,industrial methods of agriculture deplete the soil,pollute water tables and fail to benefit small-scale farmers.Agro-ecological methods – aimed at producing food without damaging natural resources – are by contrast more sustainable for the farmers and more nutritious for consumers.Advocates say these methods are profitable for small-scale farmers and more productive with high yields and cheap inputs.They say 'we need to develop local markets, create local diversity and increase the capacity of local economies'.Using them could have a huge effect on the 70% of Africans that rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.This was endorsed by a conference in Mali in 2015.Even large commercial farms are starting to adopt the agro-ecological methods. Currently,six companies supply 60% of the world's commercial seed market and 11 companies supply 98% of the world's pesticide market. Supporters of agro-ecological methods claim that these huge multinationals can easily capture markets through their combined financial and political power and can restrict farmers' choice of what inputs to buy and which markets to supply.Those representing small farmers say that these markets are not competitive.Large corporations deny this accusation that they restrict markets and exploit small-scale farmers.They say farmers have to make a new choice each year so whenever input suppliers have a new product they need to offer something that is reliable so that the customers will come back and buy more.Source: African Business, August/September 2015

        Question: The economic impacts of the increasing use of all-electric cars
Some governments have agreed targets to reduce air pollution and, as part of this, are concerned about the social costs caused by the use of petrol and diesel vehicles. In response, car manufacturers are producing all-electric cars. The sales of these are increasing, especially in developed countries. The success of this switch to all-electric cars will depend on improving both battery technology as well as building an infrastructure in which, as drivers reduce their use of fossil fuels, electricity charging points will replace petrol pumps.
Fig. 1.1 shows the cumulative number of all-electric cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Fig. 1.2 shows the annual sales of all cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Some forecasters predict that about one third of the world’s cars will be all-electric by 2040. Their forecasts are based on the assumption that the costs of batteries to run these cars will have declined steeply from their present levels. Battery costs are dependent on supplies of various metals which are used as component parts. Supplies of these metals are finite and their prices, linked to mining costs, will be crucial in increasing the scale of all-electric car production.
In 2016, the cost of the batteries was 49% of the total cost of the car. In 2017 it was stated at a New Energy conference in Shanghai that battery prices would need to drop by more than half before all-electric cars would become competitive with cars powered by petrol and diesel engines. 
Oil producers claim that growth in sales of all-electric cars will not substantially reduce world demand for oil. The world needs oil for much more than just cars. Cars account for only about a fifth of the 95 million barrels the world consumes every day. Most of the rest is used in industry or to fuel heavy goods vehicles, aircraft and ships, which do not have easy non-oil alternatives. In developing economies, petrol sales are expected to continue rising because these countries do not have the infrastructure or sufficient capital investment to enable the switch to electric vehicles.

Use the information to discuss what might happen to the long-run average cost of producing batteries for all-electric cars.

Falling LRAC depends on economies of scale. LRAC comprises AFC and AVC [2].
Output of electric cars is expected to rise significantly in the long run. As output rises, AFC may well fall because of economies of scale in production [1]
However, unless battery technology changes, AVC are likely to rise eventually. Batteries are a large component of the cost, and their manufacture depends on finite supplies of component metals. As demand increases, prices will rise as mineral reserves become depleted. This could counteract possible reductions in AFC. [2]

        Question: Increasing public sector debt is a good policy
Politicians do not usually think it a success to borrow a large amount of money but, in June 2020, when the economy was approaching a recession, the United Kingdom (UK) borrowed five times as much as it did in June 2019. This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.

Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.
There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession. 
The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.
However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices. Further, the incentives and marketing discounts used by the scheme are often thought to be confusing and make it more difficult for the consumer to compare prices. There are risks for retailers too. It requires substantial investment to run such a scheme – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. 
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? The relative importance of factors that influence consumers when choosing from which shop to buy groceries are one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies who have invested in card schemes use them as a means to gather data on customers. When the loyalty card is used the retailer can see what the customer prefers to buy and can direct future offers to their wants in specific promotions both on-line and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers' wants. 
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. However, many purchases are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Evidence for the effectiveness of cards:• Cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions;• Article also says retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through cards. (2)In contrast to that it also says• Price is not most significant factor in determining choice;• Also there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit, or has low emotional involvement.

        Question: Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices.

Companies who have invested in card schemes use them as a means to gather data on customers.

        ","Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices. Further, the incentives and marketing discounts used by the scheme are often thought to be confusing and make it more difficult for the consumer to compare prices. There are risks for retailers too. It requires substantial investment to run such a scheme – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year.

Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts. [5]","c
Evidence for the effectiveness of cards:• Cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions;• Article also says retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through cards. (2)In contrast to that it also says• Price is not most significant factor in determining choice;• Also there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit, or has low emotional involvement. (2)Conclusion: seems to be some conflict. (1)

        Question: Sustainable electricityThe UK government favoured the production of cheap, sustainable electricity and subsidised the large companies that operate wind farms. The wind farms cost a lot to build and maintain. However,as the wind is free, the companies pay nothing for fuel and can sell electricity at very low prices –when the wind is blowing. This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms. Expensive electricity production has driven industries abroad which has resulted in a loss of income and jobs. By 2020 it is estimated that small businesses will be paying 77% more per unit for electricity. The poor and the elderly have been hit hardest by high electricity bills. Some say that the support of wind farms has caused the destruction of landscapes.Source: The Times, 9 November 2015Sustainable agricultureIn Africa,industrial methods of agriculture deplete the soil,pollute water tables and fail to benefit small-scale farmers.Agro-ecological methods – aimed at producing food without damaging natural resources – are by contrast more sustainable for the farmers and more nutritious for consumers.Advocates say these methods are profitable for small-scale farmers and more productive with high yields and cheap inputs.They say 'we need to develop local markets, create local diversity and increase the capacity of local economies'.Using them could have a huge effect on the 70% of Africans that rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.This was endorsed by a conference in Mali in 2015.Even large commercial farms are starting to adopt the agro-ecological methods.

        Question: Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.
An economist said that the most effective intervention a government can make in the housing market is to relax the planning system and make it easier and cheaper to build more homes. Increased supply, leading to lower prices, would encourage demand. Others said that ‘although there is talk of a large rise in the price of houses, it is not uniform throughout the country and trying to influence the basic laws of supply and demand is not the right way of tackling the problem.’
The buying of housing gives rise to increased consumer spending and some argue that this helps the economy. Although policies by the government and the central bank had increased consumer demand and spending, such expenditure is quite different from the export-led growth model preferred by the government. Analysts suggested that the demand and supply conditions causing the current situation cannot last forever. When they end, the effect on the housing market (which by then will have many people with very high debts) will be very bad for the economy. This can be seen in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where property values are in decline.

With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        You are an A-Level economics teacher. You will be given an A-Level data response question, which includes an economics article or extract and a question concerning it. Generate responses to data-response questions in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        Formatting & Structure
        1.	Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2.	Match length to marks:
        •	2-3 marks: 1–2 sentences (direct answer, no analysis).
        •	4-5 marks: 1–2 paragraphs (explain concepts + 1-2 article quotes).
        •	6-8 marks: 3–4 paragraphs (analyze both sides, use theory + evidence).
        •   Questions asking to ""state"": simple statement of point.
        •   Questions asking to ""explain"": 1 statement of a point + an explanation of that point based on A-Level economics knowledge.
        •   Questions asking to ""consider"", ""discuss"", or ""assess"": full analysis of valid points on both sides of the argument + conclusion that reaches a final judgement.
        Theory & Article Integration
        1.	Name and explain syllabus concepts (e.g., “Monopolies restrict output due to their downward-sloping AR curve, leading to allocative inefficiency where P > MC”).
        2.	Quote the article directly, if asked to do so in the question (e.g., “The ‘US$68 billion profits’ reflect supernormal profits”).
        3.	Reference diagrams in text (e.g., “In a negative externality diagram, MSC lies above MPC”).
        4.  You should quote the article whenever necessary, but ensure that if the question does not ask you about the article, focus predominantly on economic theory.
        High-Mark Elaboration (6-8 marks)
        For every theoretical claim, include:
        1.	Cause: “X occurs because...” (e.g., “Prices rise because monopolies set output where MR=MC”).
        2.	Effect: “This leads to...” (e.g., “Higher prices reduce consumer surplus”).
        3.	Chain of reasoning: “As a result...” (e.g., “Predatory pricing deters competitors, reducing contestability”).
        4.	Syllabus example: “This aligns with the concept of...” (e.g., “Barriers to entry”).
        Non-Negotiables
        -   DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        •	Avoid shorthand: Replace “shifts supply” → “An excise tax shifts S left from S1 to S2, raising equilibrium price from P1 to P2.”

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        ","Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance.

        Question: Pakistan's agriculture survives on subsidies
As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

The higher cost of production in Pakistan has serious implications for Pakistan's participation in global trade in agricultural products. This problem is particularly critical as Pakistan seeks to increase exports to reduce a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.
A complaint of farmers is that GST, a sales tax, is charged when they purchase fertilisers. In May, the government gave in to pressure and cut GST on fertilisers from 17% to 2%. Farmers' leaders want the tax to be completely removed from fertiliser sales. Their priority, however, is for a large increase in the subsidy paid to farmers to a level comparable to that paid to farmers in India. In Pakistan's current economic position this prospect appears to be remote.
Pakistan's farmers also complain about the subsidies that are paid to farmers in richer neighbouring countries. They strongly argue that these subsidies are unfair on farmers from developing countries and are holding back their economic development.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla 



Ice cream producers can use natural vanilla or vanillin to produce ice cream.





State the concept that an economist would use to measure the responsiveness of the demand for natural vanilla to a change in the price of vanillin. [1]

According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        ","Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher. You will be given an A-Level data response question, which includes an economics article or extract and a question concerning it. Generate responses to data-response questions in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        Formatting & Structure
        1.	Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2.	Match length to marks:
        •	2-3 marks: 1–2 sentences (direct answer, no analysis).
        •	4-5 marks: 1–2 paragraphs (explain concepts + 1-2 article quotes).
        •	6-8 marks: 3–4 paragraphs (analyze both sides, use theory + evidence).
        •   Questions asking to ""state"": simple statement of point.
        •   Questions asking to ""explain"": 1 statement of a point + an explanation of that point based on A-Level economics knowledge.
        •   Questions asking to ""consider"", ""discuss"", or ""assess"": full analysis of valid points on both sides of the argument + conclusion that reaches a final judgement.
        Theory & Article Integration
        1.	Name and explain syllabus concepts (e.g., “Monopolies restrict output due to their downward-sloping AR curve, leading to allocative inefficiency where P > MC”).
        2.	Quote the article directly, if asked to do so in the question (e.g., “The ‘US$68 billion profits’ reflect supernormal profits”).
        3.	Reference diagrams in text (e.g., “In a negative externality diagram, MSC lies above MPC”).
        4.  You should quote the article whenever necessary, but ensure that if the question does not ask you about the article, focus predominantly on economic theory.
        High-Mark Elaboration (6-8 marks)
        For every theoretical claim, include:
        1.	Cause: “X occurs because...” (e.g., “Prices rise because monopolies set output where MR=MC”).
        2.	Effect: “This leads to...” (e.g., “Higher prices reduce consumer surplus”).
        3.	Chain of reasoning: “As a result...” (e.g., “Predatory pricing deters competitors, reducing contestability”).
        4.	Syllabus example: “This aligns with the concept of...” (e.g., “Barriers to entry”).
        Non-Negotiables
        -   DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        •	Avoid shorthand: Replace “shifts supply” → “An excise tax shifts S left from S1 to S2, raising equilibrium price from P1 to P2.”


        Question: Poland: a growing economy
Extract 1: Poland’s successful transition from a planned economy
Since 1995, Poland has grown faster than all other large economies at a similar level of development. By 2015, Poland’s national income had reached a record level. Consumption expenditure rose and exports dramatically increased, coming close to US$250 billion in 2013. 
Poland’s growth has been based on skilled labour and entrepreneurship, not on natural resources. Two crucial factors were important in Poland’s development. Firstly, Poland adopted a policy of expanding the quantity and quality of education. In 2015, 50% of young people studied at university level, up from 10% in 1989. Secondly, the Polish government used funds from the European Union (EU) to develop transport links that helped to connect Poland with Western Europe.
Poland seems to have been thorough in introducing market-oriented reforms at the beginning of its transition from a planned economy in the 1990s. This helped to create a private sector boom and ensured Poland avoided a post-transition recession. It managed the privatisation process in an efficient way. Lastly, Poland benefited from a large and rapidly growing domestic market, which helped to insulate it from external shocks, such as the global financial crisis in 2007–08. 
Poland’s performance in the last 25 years could be called a miracle.

Extract 2: Will Poland’s economy slow down?
The Polish economy’s growth slowed significantly in 2016, mainly due to a slowdown in private investment. The outlook for 2017 was also gloomy, with concerns regarding the global economy and domestic economic policy. Private consumption and public investment were expected to continue to be strong, but a significant slowdown in economic activity was expected throughout the year.
This was because of a significant decline in investment by private companies. In the first half of 2016 companies were cutting spending on fixed capital. A survey by the Polish central bank indicated that companies were very reluctant to start new investments. Entrepreneurs were afraid of the possible consequences of changes in the government’s economic policy, for example increased indirect taxes such as general sales taxes. In addition, foreign companies were delaying major investments in Poland because of the uncertainties in the economic climate.
After a period of rising net exports of goods, by 2016 the trend was reversing mainly due to a decline in demand from the larger EU economies. The outlook for 2017 was not any better and the fall in net exports of goods was expected to be the main factor slowing down the Polish economy.
Public spending was one possible way in which Poland’s economic growth could have been boosted in 2017. The government could increase the budget deficit and take other demandstimulating actions. An interesting suggestion from the government was to decrease the retirement age back to its 2012 level (65 years for men and 60 years for women). All of these proposals might keep GDP growth above 3% until the end of the year.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Trade war breaks out between the United States (US) and China

Fig 1.1: Components of the US current account, Q1 2010 to Q1 2018 

Fig. 1.2: Chinese yuan to US dollar rate of exchange, August 2017 to July 2018 
Extract 1: The US government says, ‘We are confronting China’s unfair trade policies’ 
For many years, China has pursued industrial policies and unfair trade practices – including dumping, discriminatory non-tariff barriers and industrial subsidies – that favour Chinese firms and make it impossible for many US firms to compete. China imposes much higher tariffs on US exports than the US imposes on China. China’s average tariff rate is nearly three times higher than the average US rate. Certain products are even more imbalanced, for instance the US charges a 2.5% tariff on Chinese cars, while China currently maintains a 25% tariff on cars from the US. China has banned imports of some US agricultural products, excluding US farmers from a major market for their goods. China has dumped and unfairly subsidised a range of goods for the US market, undermining US domestic firms. In 2018 alone, the US government has found dumping or unfair subsidies on 13 different products.
Source: The White House, US government, 29 May 2018
Extract 2: Winners and losers in the US–China trade war
The US government imposed a first round of tariffs on Chinese goods on 6 July 2018, by introducing 25% taxes on US$34 billion of Chinese imports. These were a response to China’s“unfair trade policies” – the US claimed China was selling Chinese products in the US below their normal price, called ‘dumping’, as well as subsidising the production of goods exported to the US. It was then announced that tariffs on a further US$50 billion worth of imports from China would come into effect. The US threats have risen since, with the president saying he is ready to impose tariffs on all US$500 billion of Chinese imports.
China has retaliated, saying it will levy new tariffs on more than 5200 US products, if the US government proceeds with its latest tariff threat. The duties would range from 5% to 25% on US$60 billion worth of US products imported into China, including further agricultural products such as soya beans.
The US government imposed tariffs because they said that the “unfair trade practices” have resulted in a US trade deficit with China, but this makes no sense. The trade deficit is an inevitable by-product of a robust US economy, a large US fiscal deficit and a strong US dollar. If correcting the US trade deficit is the government’s policy aim then it should raise US taxes to reduce the fiscal deficit and the US central bank should act to lower the value of the US dollar against China’s currency, the yuan.
Both countries will lose in a major trade war, but the losses will differ in kind and amount. It could cut China’s exports to the US by about a third, some US$200 billion annually. Eventually, Chinese firms will find new markets and create new products to compensate. For a period of two or three years, however, the disruption to workers and firms will be enormous. As many as 4 million Chinese workers could become unemployed, and many Chinese firms will go out of business. 
If US exports to China are cut by a third in a major trade war, the US will lose about US$50 billion of exports annually. About 250000 US workers will lose their jobs. If US firms can see no end to the trade war, they will reorganise and locate production in lower-cost countries like Vietnam and Peru. The Chinese government, however, will strongly encourage Chinese firms to produce many of their goods at home, even though the cost will be much higher.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations.

        Question: Argentina raises interest rates to 40 per cent
Fig. 1.1: Argentina's exchange rate (pesos per US dollar), May 2016 to May 2018
On 4 May 2018, Argentina's central bank raised interest rates to 40%. The day before this increase they were raised from 30.25% to 33.25%. A week earlier, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises were aimed at supporting Argentina's currency, the peso, which lost a quarter of its value over the previous year. Despite these rises, the peso, which before the economic turmoil in Argentina in 2001–2002 was fixed at parity with the US dollar, was trading at about 22 pesos to the US dollar. Risks to the peso had been developing for some time. These included large budget and current account deficits, a heavy government debt burden, persistent high inflation and an overvalued currency. 
Inflation, a long-standing problem in Argentina, was 25% in 2017, the highest annual rate in South America except for Venezuela. The central bank has set an annual inflation target of 15% and has stated it will continue to take measures to achieve it.
Argentina's new president is pursuing a pro-market economic reform programme, seeking to reverse the protectionism and high government spending of previous governments. The president has pledged to reduce government spending drastically. The political opposition wants to stop him from removing subsidies on a range of basic household products, including gas and electricity. Removing the subsidies may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from its current high level to an annual rate of about 5% by 2020.
International and domestic investors still believe the president has a good plan for Argentina'seconomic recovery, but they are not convinced he has enough political support to achieve it.

In the extract it is stated that risks to the peso have been developing for some time and that large budget and current account deficits are some of these risks.

        Question: Argentina raises interest rates to 40 per cent
Fig. 1.1: Argentina's exchange rate (pesos per US dollar), May 2016 to May 2018
On 4 May 2018, Argentina's central bank raised interest rates to 40%. The day before this increase they were raised from 30.25% to 33.25%. A week earlier, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises were aimed at supporting Argentina's currency, the peso, which lost a quarter of its value over the previous year. Despite these rises, the peso, which before the economic turmoil in Argentina in 2001–2002 was fixed at parity with the US dollar, was trading at about 22 pesos to the US dollar. Risks to the peso had been developing for some time. These included large budget and current account deficits, a heavy government debt burden, persistent high inflation and an overvalued currency. 
Inflation, a long-standing problem in Argentina, was 25% in 2017, the highest annual rate in South America except for Venezuela. The central bank has set an annual inflation target of 15% and has stated it will continue to take measures to achieve it.
Argentina's new president is pursuing a pro-market economic reform programme, seeking to reverse the protectionism and high government spending of previous governments. The president has pledged to reduce government spending drastically. The political opposition wants to stop him from removing subsidies on a range of basic household products, including gas and electricity. Removing the subsidies may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from its current high level to an annual rate of about 5% by 2020.
International and domestic investors still believe the president has a good plan for Argentina'seconomic recovery, but they are not convinced he has enough political support to achieve it.

In the extract it is stated that risks to the peso have been developing for some time and that large budget and current account deficits are some of these risks.





State what the upward trend shown in Fig. 1.1 means has happened to the value of the peso between 2016 and 2018. [1]

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: The Lagos economy is working
Nigeria discovered oil 50 years ago and is now the world's sixth biggest oil exporter. The recent increase in global oil prices has had a very large positive effect on the country's balance of trade and has also improved the country's terms of trade.
Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria, with a population of over 20 million, and has undergone a successful economic transformation in recent years. It has used the private sector to become the most productive and dynamic part of Nigeria's economy. The owner of one of Nigeria's largest companies has stressed the enormous economic progress that the country has made in recent years: ""I'm a great believer in Nigeria because the opportunities here are enormous."" His company's success shows what private enterprise can achieve in a mixed economy especially if it is provided with the right incentives by the government.
Most Nigerian entrepreneurs are operating in Lagos and entrepreneurship has certainlyplayed a key role in the modern Lagos economy. Start-up initiatives have been encouragedand the need to be innovative has been increasingly recognised, leading to the developmentof new goods, services and markets. The city is the centre of thriving music, fashion, film andtechnology industries that have significant influence throughout Africa.
A 'free trade zone' on the edge of Lagos has been established where private sector firms pay no business taxes to the government and there are now numerous start-up enterprises that are thriving. The government aims to lower costs, reduce bureaucracy and make the economy more flexible and efficient with the hope of boosting trade. The zone is located next to a deep sea port and has good road connections with both the rest of Nigeria and other countries in the region.
Lagos is an important transport hub, with three major ports and West Africa's most important international airport. In 2016 the output of Lagos was valued at US$136 billion while Nigeria's total national output was valued at US$405 billion. 
A former governor of the Nigerian central bank, has stated: ""Since 2000, Lagos has been transformed. In terms of an improved infrastructure and a supportive economic environment, the government has given firms a greater opportunity to thrive.""

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: The Lagos economy is working
Nigeria discovered oil 50 years ago and is now the world's sixth biggest oil exporter. The recent increase in global oil prices has had a very large positive effect on the country's balance of trade and has also improved the country's terms of trade.
Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria, with a population of over 20 million, and has undergone a successful economic transformation in recent years. It has used the private sector to become the most productive and dynamic part of Nigeria's economy. The owner of one of Nigeria's largest companies has stressed the enormous economic progress that the country has made in recent years: ""I'm a great believer in Nigeria because the opportunities here are enormous."" His company's success shows what private enterprise can achieve in a mixed economy especially if it is provided with the right incentives by the government.
Most Nigerian entrepreneurs are operating in Lagos and entrepreneurship has certainlyplayed a key role in the modern Lagos economy. Start-up initiatives have been encouragedand the need to be innovative has been increasingly recognised, leading to the developmentof new goods, services and markets. The city is the centre of thriving music, fashion, film andtechnology industries that have significant influence throughout Africa.
A 'free trade zone' on the edge of Lagos has been established where private sector firms pay no business taxes to the government and there are now numerous start-up enterprises that are thriving. The government aims to lower costs, reduce bureaucracy and make the economy more flexible and efficient with the hope of boosting trade. The zone is located next to a deep sea port and has good road connections with both the rest of Nigeria and other countries in the region.
Lagos is an important transport hub, with three major ports and West Africa's most important international airport. In 2016 the output of Lagos was valued at US$136 billion while Nigeria's total national output was valued at US$405 billion. 
A former governor of the Nigerian central bank, has stated: ""Since 2000, Lagos has been transformed. In terms of an improved infrastructure and a supportive economic environment, the government has given firms a greater opportunity to thrive.""

With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Zambia bears the brunt of China's economic slowdown
Fig. 1: Zambian kwacha and copper priceSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream
Zambia was one of Africa's main beneficiaries when China's economy was expanding. With copper its key export, China's huge demand for minerals helped the southern African nation enjoy a decade of economic boom. But as China's economy slows down, Zambia finds itself with real problems. A large mining group has announced it is to suspend production for 18 months. In addition, a Chinese-owned company has said it will suspend operations and cut jobs in Zambia because of the copper price. The situation highlights the vulnerability of Africa’s resource-dependent nations to the fortunes of China.
Zambia is Africa's second biggest copper producer and depends on the metal for about 70% of its foreign exchange earnings and 25–30% of government revenue. Copper prices have fallen 18% this year, sliding to a six year low of below US$5000 per tonne last month. As a result, Zambia has been ranked top of an index of African nations most exposed to China's slowdown. In 2012, Zambian exports to China amounted to 4.3% of Zambia's national income.
During the boom years, mining led to billions of dollars of investment. Much of this was foreign direct investment from China. The sector was a key driver of Zambia's economy, which grew by an annual average of 6.4% over the last decade – one of the world's fastest growth rates.
The Zambian government is now struggling to balance its budget. It is expected that the 2015 fiscal deficit will be much greater than previously estimated, and the government has pledged to reduce its spending. A further problem is that the weakness of Zambia's currency, the kwacha, risks feeding through into inflation.
The government has spoken of the need for economic diversification to reduce the country's dependence on copper. This is a tough task which China's slowdown has highlighted for many resource‑rich African nations.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

Generate responses to data-response questions in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        Formatting & Structure
        1.	Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2.	Match length to marks:
        •	2-3 marks: 1–2 sentences (direct answer, no analysis).
        •	4-5 marks: 1–2 paragraphs (explain concepts + 1-2 article quotes).
        •	6-8 marks: 3–4 paragraphs (analyze both sides, use theory + evidence).
        •   Questions asking to ""state"": simple statement of point.
        •   Questions asking to ""explain"": 1 statement of a point + an explanation of that point based on A-Level economics knowledge.
        •   Questions asking to ""consider"", ""discuss"", or ""assess"": full analysis of valid points on both sides of the argument + conclusion that reaches a final judgement.
        Theory & Article Integration
        1.	Name and explain syllabus concepts (e.g., “Monopolies restrict output due to their downward-sloping AR curve, leading to allocative inefficiency where P > MC”).
        2.	Quote the article directly, if asked to do so in the question (e.g., “The ‘US$68 billion profits’ reflect supernormal profits”).
        3.	Reference diagrams in text (e.g., “In a negative externality diagram, MSC lies above MPC”).
        4.  You should quote the article whenever necessary, but ensure that if the question does not ask you about the article, focus predominantly on economic theory.
        High-Mark Elaboration (6-8 marks)
        For every theoretical claim, include:
        1.	Cause: “X occurs because...” (e.g., “Prices rise because monopolies set output where MR=MC”).
        2.	Effect: “This leads to...” (e.g., “Higher prices reduce consumer surplus”).

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Pakistan and the Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI)
The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.
Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.
Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.
The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: The impact of demonetisation in India
India has a vast informal economy, where products and labour are exchanged for cash without official records, so that the authorities cannot easily trace the transactions. In November 2016, this informal economy was affected by a government decision to adopt a policy of 'demonetisation'.This involved the withdrawal from circulation of India's two most used bank notes, the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. This policy removed 14 trillion rupees of cash from the most cash-dependent major economy in the world. There were long queues outside banks as people tried to open bank accounts to deposit these notes before they were no longer valid.The policy was intended to remove cash hoarded by the very rich elite, criminals and the large number of people who did not pay tax.The government later said that demonetisation was also the first step in a 'cashless' revolution to move the billions of transactions undertaken each day in India through the banking system so that the tax authorities could trace them. In 2016, only 1% of workers paid income tax.
India's Labour Minister announced that it would become compulsory for employers to pay their employees through bank accounts, a hugely ambitious step in a country where as many as 90% of workers were paid in cash. Many business owners were dreading the prospect of paying their employees through bank accounts. One factory owner in Delhi commented: “How do you think I can pay the workers with a cheque if they don't have a bank account? It takes three days to clear a cheque. What will they eat during those days?”
The Indian government's vision of a cashless economy does not seem to correspond to the reality of working life in India. Another factory owner stated that this would affect the production process:“Rickshaw pullers transfer goods from my factory to the shops. For one trip I pay a rickshaw puller 100 rupees. Does the government expect me to give them a cheque for such a small amount?How do I pay them if I am not allowed to use cash? If I have to write a cheque for every payment this will increase my costs considerably.""The workers are also concerned about the change to the law that will force them to have their wages paid directly into banks. Money performs a number of important functions in an economy and cash has an acceptability that still matters for many workers. One worker commented: “I am a daily wage worker and I am not sure if I will have a job tomorrow. If I receive cash in hand, I know I have the money"".If demonetisation is to succeed, the Indian government will need to introduce incentives to persuade millions of people to open bank accounts. However, this will not be easy to achieve because around 30% of people in India still do not have bank accounts.Fig. 1.1 shows India's money supply as measured by M1, which consists of notes and coins in circulation and balances in bank deposits that can be spent immediately e.g. through withdrawals,cheques or debit cards.Source: Adapted from The Guardian, 21 December 2016

        ","The impact of demonetisation in India
India has a vast informal economy, where products and labour are exchanged for cash without official records, so that the authorities cannot easily trace the transactions. In November 2016, this informal economy was affected by a government decision to adopt a policy of 'demonetisation'.This involved the withdrawal from circulation of India's two most used bank notes, the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. This policy removed 14 trillion rupees of cash from the most cash-dependent major economy in the world. There were long queues outside banks as people tried to open bank accounts to deposit these notes before they were no longer valid.The policy was intended to remove cash hoarded by the very rich elite, criminals and the large number of people who did not pay tax.The government later said that demonetisation was also the first step in a 'cashless' revolution to move the billions of transactions undertaken each day in India through the banking system so that the tax authorities could trace them. In 2016, only 1% of workers paid income tax.

The question asks for the explanation of 'A possible reason'. The marks cannot be split across more than one possible reason.The information given to candidates says that this is the total supply of notes and coins in circulation plus deposits in bank accounts. Hence the explanation must be for an increase in either cash or bank account balances.

        Question: Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Are doughnuts demerit goods?
Consumers love to eat doughnuts. In 2019, 10 billion of these deep-fried sugar-coated products were consumed in the United States (US). Fig. 1.1 shows that the US market increased steadily from 2011 to 2019. Doughnuts are widely available throughout the US. There are specialist shops selling their branded products almost everywhere; local coffee shops invariably sell ‘hole in one’ doughnuts as a popular breakfast snack to tempt consumers on their way to work. The growing number of shops selling doughnuts has been an important reason behind overall market growth.

Fig. 1.1 Doughnut market size in the US, 2011 to 2021 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a varying impact on the US doughnut market. Despite having less income, many consumers have continued to buy small luxuries such as doughnuts which remain affordable and can provide some short-term relief from the stresses of the pandemic. Overall, sales of doughnuts fell in 2020 and are forecast to remain below their 2019 peak into 2021. Reasons for this fall in demand are that consumers are making fewer shopping trips and in cities, more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack.
In the United Kingdom (UK), more so than in the US, there are growing concerns about the increase in sugar consumption amongst children. This increase comes from soft drinks, chocolate biscuits and sweets (candy) as well as from jam-filled doughnuts, all of which are widely available in supermarkets and local convenience stores. In 2021, it was estimated that a third of teenagers and two thirds of adults in the UK were overweight. This has increased the pressure on the UK government to end online advertising of a range of products including doughnuts. It has been estimated that viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories. Moreover, a ban on advertising sugary foods would result in children consuming the equivalent of 62 million fewer doughnuts a year in the UK.



Explain one reason why the US market for doughnuts contracted in 2020. [2]

        Question: Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

        Question: Ethiopia to develop through infrastructure investmentExtract 1: Ethiopia economic overviewWith 99.4 million people, Ethiopia has the second largest population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its annual population growth rate was 2.5% in 2015. It is also one of the world's poorest countries.The country's per capita income of US$590 is substantially lower than the regional average. In 2011, 33.5% of the population lived in extreme poverty.The economy has experienced strong and broad-based growth over the past decade, averaging 10.8% per year between 2003 and 2015 compared to the regional average of 5.4% per year.Private consumption and public investment have been the main drivers of aggregate demand in recent years.In 2017, the government was implementing the second phase of its Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II), due to run from 2015 to 2020. Its aim was to continue improvements in physical infrastructure through public investment, transforming the country into a manufacturing hub. The goal was to reduce poverty in Ethiopia by 2025.Developments in the balance of payments in Ethiopia have been largely driven by the implementation of major infrastructure projects in the country that contributed to higher current account deficits, balanced by growing foreign direct investment (FDI) and long-term foreign borrowings.Source: World Bank, April 2017Extract 2: Ethiopia plans US$90 million infrastructure spending spreeDespite Ethiopia being a landlocked country, the vast majority of its imports and exports are conveyed by sea. The ports in neighbouring country Djibouti are crucial to Ethiopia because they are used for 90% of its trade.In January 2017, a US$4 billion railway project was officially completed linking Ethiopia’s capital,Addis Ababa, to the main port in Djibouti, cutting the travel time along the route from three days to just 12 hours. It was expected to cut the cost of transporting freight by a third, having a huge impact on trade flow and the lives of Ethiopians.The project was partially built and funded by Chinese companies with the assistance of the Chinese government. China Railway Group and the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation built the railway line, while China loaned Ethiopia US$2.49 billion to build the new railway. Contracts were awarded to Chinese firms to build various sections of the railway. Chinese investment in Ethiopia's infrastructure provides opportunities for Chinese steel and construction industries.China has an overcapacity in steel and needs to find markets for its excess supply.

Identify two ways in which China's economy would benefit from the building of infrastructure in Ethiopia. [2]","b
Identify two ways in which China's economy would benefit fromthe building of infrastructure in Ethiopia.For identification of any two benefits e.g.• inflow of profits to China• reduction in unemployment(2 @ 1 mark)
2
It is essential that the benefits identified relate to China's economy. An inflow of profits for example will benefit China's balance of payments. There will also be more employment, higher incomes, the reduction of excess capacity in the steel industry and so on. Identification without explanation can gain both marks, however there may be a need to be clear why the identified point is beneficial, e.g. a candidate might state that China's currency might appreciate. This might be a benefit but might also be a disadvantage. If there is doubt that the effect is beneficial it needs to be clarified.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Competition in passenger aircraft manufacturing  
Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.
The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.
In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.
Recent competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry has aimed at improving fuel efficiency, developing longer non-stop flying ranges and developing very large aircraft with a capacity of 500 passengers. The companies have been successful in achieving the first two aims. 
The third aim of developing very large aircraft was intended to move larger numbers of passengers between 'hub' airports, where they would transfer to smaller aircraft for onwards transport to regional airports. Whilst it has achieved increased passenger capacity, this development has not been a success for the airlines that bought these very large aircraft. The need for these was undermined by the success of the first two competitive developments. 
The nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry is that it involves significant fixed costs. The research and development (R&D) costs of a new aircraft can rise to US$26 billion.
Currently the two companies are concerned that China, in its drive to increase the value of its exports, will enter the aircraft manufacturing industry in the next 10 to 15 years and add a new level of competition.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: European Union (EU) to boost protection of steel industry as imports flood inThe EU is expected to strengthen its protection against steel imports, possibly as early as October 2016, as a global trade war in steel intensifies and steel imports keep flooding into the EU.The EU has strengthened trade defences over the past year, imposing anti-dumping tariffs on a range of steel products. These tariffs range from 18% to 25% for imports of steel from China. It is expected that these duties will be increased in October. EU data shows that 27% of steel imports come from China. The EU now has 37 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place for steelproducts, 15 of them against China.China, which produces half of the world's 1.6 billion tonnes of steel, has struggled to reduce its estimated 300 million tonnes of overcapacity, but the Chinese government denies its firms are dumping by selling steel at below the cost of production. It says global steel overcapacity is due to the collapse of demand after the 2008 financial crisis. Countries from Asia to the Americas disagree with China. The United States (US) claims that the Chinese government is subsidising its steel industry and that this is a form of protectionism that gives Chinese steelmakers an unfair advantage in world markets. It has imposed tariffs of up to 450% on some types of Chinese steel.India has also imposed tariffs on steel imports from a number of countries including China, Japan,Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea.Source: EurActiv.com with Reuters, August 2016Table 1.1: EU exports and imports of goods to and from China 2010–2015(billions of euros)

        Question: Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

The ringgit has depreciated from 3.1RM to 4.2RM per US dollar. It is necessary to state that the ringgit has depreciated for the first mark. The candidate does not need to provide precise figures. Figure 1.2 makes it clear that the Malaysian ringgit is now worth less dollars or the US dollar is worth more ringgit. A clear statement along these lines is sufficient for the second mark.

        Question: Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

For clear explanation of a customs union (1 mark)
For a clear explanation of a free trade area (1 mark)

The key difference between them is the common external tariff; this is part of a customs union, but not part of a free trade area. This difference needs to be made explicit to gain both marks, e.g. through words such as 'whereas' or 'however'.

2

Customs union:

an agreement between two or more countries to remove trade barriers and reduce or eliminate customs duties on mutual trade
a customs union has a common external tariff against non-member countries

Free trade area:

an agreement between two or more countries that allows the countries to freely trade with each other
a free trade area does not have a common external tariff; the countries are allowed to charge whatever tariffs they want against non-member countries

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2).

The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.

        ","Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Government policies which rely on increasing budget deficits to solve the problem of unemployment will not be successful because they do not affect the natural rate of unemployment. 
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Budget deficits used to solve the problem of unemployment are generally associated with Keynesian demand management policies. This policy approach is adopted to address the specific problem of cyclical unemployment where there is insufficient aggregate monetary demand in an economy. A budget deficit will produce net government spending which, in conjunction with the multiplier effect of this spending can lead to an increase in monetary demand which will solve the problem of cyclical unemployment. At this point it is assumed that the labour market is in equilibrium. However, natural unemployment relates to those workers who remain unemployed even though the labour market is in equilibrium. This is primarily due to market frictions on the labour market which lead to frictional and structural unemployment. In this situation, policies which rely upon budget deficits stimulating aggregate demand are unlikely to be successful. 
Alternative policies which focus upon the supply of labour are more appropriate. For example, Trade Union reform, reducing taxes on profits, subsidising new growth industries, might be used. Therefore, to some extent the statement in question is correct. It should however be also noted that increasing budget deficits might still fail to solve the problem of unemployment regardless of the impact of the natural rate of unemployment. For example, a budget deficit might lead to higher interest rates which might have a negative effect on investment, aggregate demand and employment. In addition, a budget deficit might lead to an increase in the money supply which might cause inflation and the further loss of jobs in the long run. A conclusion should refer to the above which suggests that the statement in question is only partially correct. 
L4 (18–25 marks) for a clear analysis of the relationship between an increase in a budget deficit and a reduction in unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment should be explained and linked to the specific question. Evaluation comment should be provided to establish the extent to which one might agree with the statement in question. A conclusion should be provided based on the preceding analysis/evaluation. 
L3 (14–17 marks) for accurate but only partially developed analysis based on the theory of cyclical unemployment and an explanation of natural unemployment. A limited attempt will be made to link the relationship between these two types of unemployment to the specific question. No evaluative comment will be provided. 
L2 (10–13 marks) for a mainly descriptive comment which links budget deficits to cyclical unemployment and explains what is meant by the natural rate of unemployment but does not link this comment to the specific question. 
L1 (1–9 marks) for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Analysis of difference between perfect competitive factor markets and imperfectly competitive markets. Wages may be increased by unions in imperfect markets without decreasing unemployment as long as it doesn't rise above point where mc=mr. This still leaves the firm with abnormal profit. Beyond this point, higher wages will result in a decrease in employment. Level 4 (18–25 marks): for a critique of the statement and a thorough explanation of the analysis of wage determination with a clear comparison of perfect and imperfect markets. The conclusion about employment should be clearly stated. Level 3 (14–17 marks): for a weaker critique of the statement but a competent explanation of imperfect market wage determination together with a conclusion. Level 2 (10–13 marks): for a correct but undeveloped analysis with only a brief consideration of the employment position and no real conclusion. Level 1 (1–9 marks): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.

A clear explanation of the export-led growth hypothesis should be provided. Alternative ways of achieving growth should be explained and the difference between achieving growth by internal means should be clearly established. The main part of the discussion should relate to specific problems that might face developing economies which attempt to achieve export-led growth. This should be compared with the costs and benefits of stimulating growth internally using policies to promote direct investment carried out by multinational companies.L4 (18–25) for an answer that evaluates the relative success of each type of policy by using a cost/benefit approach in each case. It is important to recognise the specific conditions required for success in each case and the extent to which this is likely to be achieved in an developing economy. Aclear comparison should be in evidence and a conclusion provided based upon the preceding discussion.
L3 (14–17) for an answer that analyses the problems faced by a developing economy when attempting to generate export-led growth. The response will also consider the analysis which underpins the promotion of foreign direct investment by multinational companies
L2 (10–13) for an answer that discusses policies that can be used to promote economic growth but does not explain export-led growth and does not distinguish between export led growth and internal methods of achieving growth. Also there would be no attempt to put into the context of a developing economy.

Question
Answer

A government's decision to move from a fixed exchange rate system to allow free market floating exchange rates will solve the problem of unemployment in the short run but will cause higher rates of inflation in the long run. Evaluate this statement.
Governments in conjunction with central banks can fix exchange rates by buying and selling the domestic currency. Floating exchange rates are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. If unemployment is rising, there are different policy options available to governments. For example, lowering interest rates might stimulate aggregate demand which will increase output and employment. Lower interest rates however will put a downward pressure on a fixed exchange rate. In response, the central bank will either have to sell pounds or increase interest rates.
Both options will undermine policies to increase employment. If a government allows exchange rates to float freely based on market forces, a reduction in interest rates will lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency. In this case lower rates will stimulate domestic demand such as consumption/investment expenditure plus a lower value of the domestic currency will further increase demand for exports. Therefore, low interest rate policies are more likely to be successful under a floating rate system. However, it should be noted that this policy is likely to be more successful when addressing the problem of cyclical unemployment rather than other types such as structural or frictional unemployment.
Also, a freely floating currency which is allowed to depreciate will have some potential inflationary effects in the long run. For example, a depreciating currency will lead to a higher cost of imports and possible cost push inflation. In addition, a switch from fixed to floating exchange rates will mean that the central bank exchange rate policy will no longer have complete control over the money supply. This might be inflationary in the long run. The extent to which inflation might rise in the long run will also be determined by other factors, for example global expansion, rising commodity prices etc.
L4 (18–25 marks): For an answer which explains the difference between fixed and floating exchange rates and analyses the links between both types of exchange rate and policies to reduce unemployment. Discussion of the potential impact of floating exchange rates on inflation in the long run. At least one evaluative comment plus a conclusion.
L3 (14–17 marks): For a clear analysis of the relationships between policies adopted to solve the problem of unemployment and different exchange rate regimes. The potential problem of inflation, relating to the switch to a floating exchange will not be fully discussed and no evaluative comment will be provided or used to provide a conclusion.
L2 (10–13 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes different exchange rate regimes and policies used to reduce unemployment. Links between different exchange rates and the potential impact on inflation in the long run will not be fully analysed.
L1 (1–9 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).
                - Diagrams described textually (axes, curves, labels, welfare loss areas), if appropriate.
                - A hypothetical example explained fully, if necessary.
                - This will be a ""mini-essay"" that contains very detailed analysis, roughly 100-150 words long.
            - DO NOT use evaluative language in this section, like ""however"" or ""this depends on"". Speak positively about the question. DO NOT generate section titles, e.g. ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"".
           
            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
            - You will need at least 5 evaluative points.
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end. (""In conclusion, ... (statement) is true given that ..., ... and ... (evaluation points)"")
                       
        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram, please:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT generate any section titles, like ""Part 1: Analysis"". Plain paragraphs only.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your analysis paragraph should be much longer (two times longer) than your evaluation. 


        Question: Analyse the difference shown by marginal revenue productivity theory between wage determination in perfect and imperfect labour markets. Discuss the proposition that, in imperfect markets, a trade union can only increase the wage rate by allowing a reduction in employment. [25]

Question
Answer
Marks


5
Analysis of difference between perfect competitive factor markets and imperfectly competitive markets. Wages may be increased by unions in imperfect markets without decreasing unemployment as long as it doesn't rise above point where mc=mr. This still leaves the firm with abnormal profit. Beyond this point, higher wages will result in a decrease in employment. Level 4 (18–25 marks): for a critique of the statement and a thorough explanation of the analysis of wage determination with a clear comparison of perfect and imperfect markets. The conclusion about employment should be clearly stated. Level 3 (14–17 marks): for a weaker critique of the statement but a competent explanation of imperfect market wage determination together with a conclusion. Level 2 (10–13 marks): for a correct but undeveloped analysis with only a brief consideration of the employment position and no real conclusion. Level 1 (1–9 marks): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Consider whether monopolies are always inefficient and what methods might be used by governments to regulate them.     [25]","


Question
Answer 
Marks


2

Explanation of the analysis of efficiency and an analysis of why monopoly might not achieve efficiency. Consideration of whether all monopolies necessarily cause inefficient production and what policy might be used by a government to deal with the inefficiency if it occurs.
L4 (18–25 marks): for a good analysis of productive and allocative efficiency; a comment on the possibility of benefits of monopoly through economies of scale, and a discussion of the likelihood of achieving this allocation through government policies.
L3 (14–17 marks): for a competent explanation of efficiency probably concentrating on productive efficiency and a more limited discussion of the possibility of achieving efficiency through government policies. Little mention of benefits of monopoly.
L2 (10–13 marks): for a limited account without a full analysis of efficiency and with a general comment on government policies.
L1 (1–9 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples, even if given in the mark scheme. 
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).
                - Diagrams described textually (axes, curves, labels, welfare loss areas), if appropriate.
                - A hypothetical example explained fully, if necessary.
                - This will be a ""mini-essay"" that contains very detailed analysis, roughly 100-150 words long.
            - DO NOT use evaluative language in this section, like ""however"" or ""this depends on"". Speak positively about the question. DO NOT generate section titles, e.g. ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"".
           
            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
            - You will need at least 5 evaluative points.
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end. (""In conclusion, ... (statement) is true given that ..., ... and ... (evaluation points)"")

Do you support this opinion? Explanation of meaning of externalities and of efficiency. Government intervention does not necessarily require there to be externalities; neither does such intervention always result in efficiency so it is not a sufficient condition to ensure efficiency. L4 (18–25 marks) for a clear explanation of efficiency and of externalities; an evaluation of whether government intervention is necessary (for both positive and negative externalities) and a reasoned conclusion about both whether government intervention is ‘necessary’ and whether it would be ‘sufficient’ to achieve efficiency. Maximum 21 for no conclusion. L3 (14–17 marks) for an explanation of externalities but a weaker comment on efficiency, briefer discussion and evaluation. The evaluation would probably concentrate on the ‘necessary’ part of the quote and not deal with government failure making the intervention unlikely to be ‘sufficient’. L2 (10–13 marks) for a weaker explanation of efficiency and probably only a consideration of one type (positive or negative) of externality and little evaluation. L1 (1–9 marks) for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant

        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given a 25-mark A-Level structured question, as well as the mark scheme to the question, which should be referenced to generate a response that would obtain full marks according to it. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples, even if given in the mark scheme. 
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).
                - Diagrams described textually (axes, curves, labels, welfare loss areas), if appropriate.
                - A hypothetical example explained fully, if necessary.
                - This will be a ""mini-essay"" that contains very detailed analysis, roughly 100-150 words long.
            - DO NOT use evaluative language in this section, like ""however"" or ""this depends on"". Speak positively about the question. DO NOT generate section titles, e.g. ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"".
           
            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
            - You will need at least 5 evaluative points.
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end. (""In conclusion, ... (statement) is true given that ..., ... and ... (evaluation points)"")
                       
        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram, please:

The answer should consider the initial proposition and comment on its validity. It should then identify and describe the necessary conditions for efficient resource allocation and consider whether it can be achieved by the market alone. L4 (18–25) For a reasoned and clear discussion with accurate development of theory and good explicit links to the statement together with reasoned evaluative comments and conclusions. Max 20 if no conclusion. L3 (14–17) For a competent comment together with limited elaboration of the analysis or imprecise links to the statement. There will be some discussion but the evaluation will not be fully developed or extensive. L2 (10–13) For a brief explanation but weak or ill-explained links to the statement. The explanation will be undeveloped with some limited analysis. L1 (1–9) For an answer which shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped. The answer will have some correct facts but include irrelevancies. Errors of theory or omissions of analysis will be substantial.

Candidates should explain the link between injections and withdrawals and comment on the balance between them which forms an equilibrium. The process of change by the multiplier should be explained. They should recognise that there is an open economy with a government sector. Any reasoned discussion should be accepted. They might suggest the equilibrium changes because of tax changes, or government spending changes. Investment might change because of interest rate policy. The private sector may be influenced by regulative policy. They could also suggest that governments may encourage foreign investment or international trade. They need to relate the policy to the aim of the government to assess its merits. L4 (18–25) For a thorough discussion of the factors which are involved in the analysis of an equilibrium income involving public and private sectors in an open economy together with a discussion on the merits together with a reasoned conclusion.(weak or no conclusion 18 max). L3 (14–17) For a competent discussion of the factors involved in an equilibrium. The multiplier will be explained well but the suggested relative importance of different policies will be brief. With a conclusion. Weak or no conclusion 15 max). L2 (10–13) For an answer which concentrates on the first part of the question explaining what is meant by an equilibrium income; or for an answer with a weak analysis of equilibrium and the multiplier but also with a little discussion of the merits of different policies. L1 (1–9) For an answer which shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped, or where the answer contains irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Explanation of meaning of efficient allocation and explanation of the analysiswhich ensures an efficient optimum may be reached. Distinction between productive and allocative efficiency. Discussion of reasons for market failureand necessity/desirability of government intervention to achieve efficiency. This could be by persuasion (nudge theory) rather than by enforcement. Nudge theory, originally an ethical idea not a government manipulative tool, involves designing choices to encourage decision making in wider positive interests of society. But it can be used in government context. Conclusion about efficacy of relying on market system.
L4   For a thorough explanation and a reasoned discussion dealing with bothaspects of efficiency and possible reasons for government intervention. Aconclusion should be drawn.                                                                              18–25
L3   For a competent explanation of the terms with accurate but limited discussion. Maximum 15 without a conclusion.                                                                    14–17
L2   For a correct but undeveloped explanation with some attempt at analysis but only brief discussion with no conclusion.                                                           10–13
L1   For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.          1–9

        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given a 25-mark A-Level structured question, as well as the mark scheme to the question, which should be referenced to generate a response that would obtain full marks according to it. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples, even if given in the mark scheme. 
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).
                - Diagrams described textually (axes, curves, labels, welfare loss areas), if appropriate.
                - A hypothetical example explained fully, if necessary.
                - This will be a ""mini-essay"" that contains very detailed analysis, roughly 100-150 words long.
            - DO NOT use evaluative language in this section, like ""however"" or ""this depends on"". Speak positively about the question. DO NOT generate section titles, e.g. ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"".
           
            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.

Discuss the extent to which the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW) provide better measures of living standards than Gross National Income (GNI).  Explanation of alternative measures HDI and MEW of the standard of living (SoL). Definition of GNI and explanation of real per capita GNI and its link to measuring the standard of living (SoL). Explanation of the relevance and limitations of the alternative methods and GNI to the problems of measuring alternative and GNI in developing countries – statistical problems cost of collection/accuracy of collection.  L4 (18–25 marks) For an answer which describes the three measures of the SoL. A sound discussion of the limitations/difficulties of the GNI and one other measure. A conclusion is reached for 22–25 marks.  L3 (14–17 marks) For an answer which describes GNI and an alternative measure of the SoL. Some limited analysis of the limitations/difficulties of either measure.  L2 (10–13 marks) For an answer which explains GNI as a measure of the SoL. Some limitations of GNI are identified.  L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer which has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies. Errors of theory or omissions of analysis will be substantial.

Candidates should consider each part of the statement. The theory of wage determination should be explained and a comment given on how the outcome may be affected by the existence of trade union bargaining, by minimum wages affecting the supply, by large monopsonies forcing down wages from the competitive level. A conclusion of the possible usefulness of the theory should be given. L4 (18–25): for a critique of the statement and a thorough explanation of the analysis of wage determination with a clear comment on how unions, minimum wages and large monopsonistic businesses may be incorporated into the theory. There should be a conclusion and a well-structured answer. Must have MRP to reach L4. L3 (14–17): for a weaker critique of the statement mentioning either all three elements less rigorously or two elements more fully. There should still be a competent explanation of imperfect markets together with a conclusion. L2 (10–13): for a correct but undeveloped analysis with much briefer critique of the statement. Max 11 without a conclusion. L1 (1–9): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

Answers should clearly distinguish between economic growth and development and examine the extent to which economic growth relies solely on higher levels of investment. Alternative ways of achieving economic development should be discussed and the role of private sector investment as an alternative to government investment should also be considered. A conclusion should be drawn based on the preceding discussion. L4 (18–25): for an answer that examines the extent to which economic development can only be achieved by economic growth and which discusses whether economic growth is the sole determinant of investment. A conclusion would be required L3 (14–17): for an answer that attempt to analyse the relationship between change in the level of investment and changes in growth and how this might impact on the level of development L2 (10–13): for an answer that provides a descriptive account of the difference between economic growth and economic development and the difference between government and private investment L1 (1–9): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant

        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).
                - Diagrams described textually (axes, curves, labels, welfare loss areas), if appropriate.
                - A hypothetical example explained fully, if necessary.
                - This will be a ""mini-essay"" that contains very detailed analysis, roughly 100-150 words long.
            - DO NOT use evaluative language in this section, like ""however"" or ""this depends on"". Speak positively about the question. DO NOT generate section titles, e.g. ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"".
           
            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
            - You will need at least 5 evaluative points.
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end. (""In conclusion, ... (statement) is true given that ..., ... and ... (evaluation points)"")

Responses should provide a clear explanation of what economists mean by recession with the emphasis on low growth rates, deflation and risingunemployment. The link between recession and national debt and budget deficits should also be discussed. Analysis should then be used to explain how Keynesian demand management policies are supposed to work. An attempt should then be made to evaluate the extent to which Keynesian policies might be effective under the conditions described.L4 (18–25 marks): for an answer that examines why Keynesian policies might not be effective. This should include traditional criticisms of such policies, for example Crowding Out and possible problems relating to balance of payments deficits. Also it is expected that discussion will make the link between existing high levels of national debt and that this problem would be made worse by continuing to allow substantial budget deficits. Alternative approaches might also be discussed and a conclusion provided.L3 (14–17 marks): for an analysis of how Keynesian solutions to the problem of high unemployment would operate in theory. This analysis would focus upon the use of budget deficits combined with a multiplier effect and how this might impact on the level of output and employment.L2 (10–13 marks): for an answer that describes the terms recession,budget deficits and national debt and makes some attempt to explain how Keynesian demand management policies are supposed to work.L1 (1–9 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Do you support this opinion? Explanation of meaning of externalities and of efficiency. Government intervention does not necessarily require there to be externalities; neither does such intervention always result in efficiency so it is not a sufficient condition to ensure efficiency. L4 (18–25 marks) for a clear explanation of efficiency and of externalities; an evaluation of whether government intervention is necessary (for both positive and negative externalities) and a reasoned conclusion about both whether government intervention is ‘necessary’ and whether it would be ‘sufficient’ to achieve efficiency. Maximum 21 for no conclusion. L3 (14–17 marks) for an explanation of externalities but a weaker comment on efficiency, briefer discussion and evaluation. The evaluation would probably concentrate on the ‘necessary’ part of the quote and not deal with government failure making the intervention unlikely to be ‘sufficient’. L2 (10–13 marks) for a weaker explanation of efficiency and probably only a consideration of one type (positive or negative) of externality and little evaluation. L1 (1–9 marks) for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant

Explain what is meant by cost benefit analysis and consider how it might be used by a government to decide whether a new hospital should be built. 
The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to consider negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits. In many cases the provision of certain types of good will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value of benefits that might be gained from a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice. 
The type of analysis outlined above would be particularly useful when considering whether to build a new hospital. Hospitals are huge capital projects; they are extremely costly and the associated benefits are only likely to be gained over a long time period. As well as private costs there are likely to be negative externalities, for example, effect on the local wildlife, increased traffic congestion around the hospital. Also there will be positive externalities, for example easier access to health care for local residents, more jobs for doctors and nurses, local multiplier effects associated with building and maintaining the hospital. When all the costs and benefits have been considered, a government has to decide whether the net benefit justifies the decision by comparing this with the opportunity cost. It should be recognised that it is very difficult to put a monetary value on externalities and to estimate the future benefits in real terms i.e. allowing for inflation.
L4 (18–25 marks) For a reasoned and clear discussion which analyses and explains the key characteristics of cost benefit analysis. This analysis should then be applied to explain government decision making, in this case whether to build a new hospital. Evaluative comment should refer to at least two problems associated with using this type of decision making. L3 (14–17 marks) For a competent analysis which clearly explains how cost benefit can be used to aid a government when deciding whether to build a new hospital. At least one evaluative comment should be provided which illustrates a difficulty associated with the use of such analysis. L2 (10–13 marks) For a descriptive explanation of cost benefit analysis but there will be little attempt to link this analysis to consider the government's decision whether to build a new hospital. No specific problems associated with the use of this analysis will be identified. L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Explain what is meant by cost benefit analysis and consider how it might be used by a government to decide whether a new hospital should be built. 
The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to consider negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits. In many cases the provision of certain types of good will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value of benefits that might be gained from a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice. 
The type of analysis outlined above would be particularly useful when considering whether to build a new hospital. Hospitals are huge capital projects; they are extremely costly and the associated benefits are only likely to be gained over a long time period. As well as private costs there are likely to be negative externalities, for example, effect on the local wildlife, increased traffic congestion around the hospital. Also there will be positive externalities, for example easier access to health care for local residents, more jobs for doctors and nurses, local multiplier effects associated with building and maintaining the hospital. When all the costs and benefits have been considered, a government has to decide whether the net benefit justifies the decision by comparing this with the opportunity cost. It should be recognised that it is very difficult to put a monetary value on externalities and to estimate the future benefits in real terms i.e. allowing for inflation.
L4 (18–25 marks) For a reasoned and clear discussion which analyses and explains the key characteristics of cost benefit analysis. This analysis should then be applied to explain government decision making, in this case whether to build a new hospital. Evaluative comment should refer to at least two problems associated with using this type of decision making. L3 (14–17 marks) For a competent analysis which clearly explains how cost benefit can be used to aid a government when deciding whether to build a new hospital. At least one evaluative comment should be provided which illustrates a difficulty associated with the use of such analysis. L2 (10–13 marks) For a descriptive explanation of cost benefit analysis but there will be little attempt to link this analysis to consider the government's decision whether to build a new hospital. No specific problems associated with the use of this analysis will be identified. L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Assess the suggestion that a free market economy is neither possible nor desirable. Explanation of meaning of the free market economy and its link to an efficient allocation of resources. Distinction between productive and allocative efficiency. Discussion of whether it is desirable – individual actions are not always best for society as a whole. Discussion of whether it is possible – existence of market failure and necessity/desirability of government intervention to achieve efficiencyL4 (18–25 marks) For a thorough explanation and a reasoned discussion dealing with both desirability and possibility; efficiency and possible reasons for market failure/government intervention. A conclusion should be drawn. Max 21 no conclusion.  L3 (14–17 marks) For a competent explanation of the meaning of pure market. The analysis will probably concentrate on either the desirability or the possibility with little reference to the other.  L2 (10–13 marks) For a correct but undeveloped explanation with some attempt at analysis but only brief discussion with no conclusion.  L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

For example, the link between an increase in GDP and the standard of living is subject to debate. The strengths/weaknesses of this link should therefore be discussed in the light of this debate. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) should be explained, and some analysis provided to decide the extent to which an increase in FDI might produce an increase in GDP. A range of costs/benefits associated with FDI might be considered. Alternative approaches by undeveloped countries to FDI, which might also lead to an increase in economic growth and living standards, might be discussed. Based on the above analysis and evaluative comment, a conclusion should be provided which attempts to decide how far it is possible to agree with the statement under consideration. L4 (18–25 marks): For a response which addresses each of the three parts of the statement. Analytical plus evaluative comment should be provided which assesses the extent to which the claims in the statement can be justified. A conclusion which summarizes the preceding analysis should be provided. L3 (14–17 marks): For accurate analysis of two parts of the statement which also questions the validity of each part under consideration. A limited conclusion which does not cover all three elements of the statement might be provided. L2 (10–13 marks): For a descriptive comment with limited development which does not question the validity of the separate parts of the statement and does not provide a conclusion.L1 (1–9 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).

            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
            - You will need at least 5 evaluative points.
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end. (""In conclusion, ... (statement) is true given that ..., ... and ... (evaluation points)"")

        Question: Private sector developers have discovered potentially profitable supplies of gas and proposed a new method of extracting it that involves drilling in some areas of natural beauty. They say it is important that a country's resources are used efficiently.
Consider whether they might mean the same as economists when they talk about the efficient use of resources and whether it is possible in practice for private organisations to achieve such economic efficiency. [25]

Question
Answer
Marks

There are three elements to the question. What is meant in economics by efficiency? Is it likely that private developers use the term in the same way? Is it possible to achieve efficiency? Candidates should explain the meaning of allocative efficiency and productive efficiency; they should conjecture whether the private developers comments relate to profits rather than allocative/productive efficiency; they should discuss whether private firms achieve allocative/productive efficiency.They may mention polices that might be used to approach allocative efficiency when the market does not reflect that situation–subsidies, regulation, taxes. It might be possible to achieve productive efficiency but more difficult to measure and achieve allocative efficiency L4 (18–25) For a reasoned and clearly structured answer which gives an explanation of both types of efficiency and a discussion of the three elements to the question. L3 (14–17) For a fair explanation but with a weaker or undeveloped discussion maybe dealing with two elements of the question. L2 (10–13) For an answer which concentrates on the explanation but does not explore the discussion or deals very briefly with one part of the discussion. L1 (1–9) For an answer which has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Explain what economists mean by an increase in real GDP per capita and discuss the extent to which an increase in real GDP per capita will have a positive impact on economic development. 
GDP is measured by the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy in a particular time period, usually one year. To ensure that an accurate measure of the real output is attained with we have to take account of the price element of the change in value of goods. By taking inflation into account we can calculate the real value of GDP. It is also helpful to calculate the relationship between this increase in real value of GDP and any change in population. Economists will divide the real GDP by the total population to calculate the amount of GDP that is available per person. This would now allow economists to calculate real GDP per capita. An increase in real GDP per capita is consistent with the achievement of economic growth. This potentially allows the population access to more goods and services and this is often associated with an increase in living standards.
However, economic development considers a much wider range of variables than economic growth and many of these variables are more difficult to measure accurately. Economic development attempts to measure the improvement in the overall quality of life enjoyed by the population. Key measures of development include access to education; access to health care; life expectancy; lower levels of poverty. An increase in real GDP per capita might have a positive impact on economic development because more resources will be available to provide better education, better access to health care and a subsequent increase in life expectancy. However, an increase in GDP per capita might a have a negative impact on economic development for reasons which might include negative effects on the environment; loss of leisure time; further inequalities in the distribution of wealth; unsustainable growth due to overuse of scare resources.
L4 (18–25 marks) For a clear explanation of real GDP per capita. Economic development will be clearly defined and at least two positive links between an increase in real GDP per capita and economic development established and analysed. At least two potential negative impacts on development will be identified and discussed and a conclusion will be provided. L3 (14–17 marks) For a limited explanation of real GDP per capita and analysis of at least one positive link between an increase in real GDP per capita and development plus a recognition of one potential negative impact on development. There will be no attempt to compare relative impacts to determine the overall extent of growth on economic development. L2 (10–13 marks) For a competent comment with the emphasis on describing real GDP per capita and what is meant by economic development. A limited attempt to identify links between growth and development will be made but responses will lack sufficient detail to address the specific question. L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

You will be given a 25-mark A-Level structured question, as well as the mark scheme to the question, which should be referenced to generate a response that would obtain full marks according to it. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples, even if given in the mark scheme. 
        3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

            Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 800 words.

            - The question will give you an economic statement to assess. This part will be your explanation for why the statement is justified by economic theory.
            - You should begin with a complete economics definition of all the key terms.
            - Then, you should explain fully why the statement is true from a theoretical perspective. The content you should include to explain this will be given under AO1 and AO2 Knowledge and understanding and analysis in the mark scheme.
            - Your task will be to expand and elaborate on the points and concepts you will need to explain the statement fully.
            - For every point, you will need to include:
                - Precise definitions of terms mentioned in the point, if necessary (e.g., “Allocative efficiency is…”).
                - Step-by-step, detailed chains of analysis (e.g., “Firms overproduce because MPC < MSC → this causes… which leads to…”).
                - Diagrams described textually (axes, curves, labels, welfare loss areas), if appropriate.
                - A hypothetical example explained fully, if necessary.
                - This will be a ""mini-essay"" that contains very detailed analysis, roughly 100-150 words long.
            - DO NOT use evaluative language in this section, like ""however"" or ""this depends on"". Speak positively about the question. DO NOT generate section titles, e.g. ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"".
           
            Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 250 words.
            
            - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
            - Possible evaluation points may be: e.g. the time period in question, the type of economy in question (market or command economy?), the type of good in question, the type of market structure in question, etc. etc.
            - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
            - You will need at least 5 evaluative points.
            - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end. (""In conclusion, ... (statement) is true given that ..., ... and ...

A clear explanation of the export-led growth hypothesis should be provided. Alternative ways of achieving growth should be explained and the difference between achieving growth by internal means should be clearly established. The main part of the discussion should relate to specific problems that might face developing economies which attempt to achieve export-led growth. This should be compared with the costs and benefits of stimulating growth internally using policies to promote direct investment carried out by multinational companies.L4 (18–25) for an answer that evaluates the relative success of each type of policy by using a cost/benefit approach in each case. It is important to recognise the specific conditions required for success in each case and the extent to which this is likely to be achieved in an developing economy. Aclear comparison should be in evidence and a conclusion provided based upon the preceding discussion.
L3 (14–17) for an answer that analyses the problems faced by a developing economy when attempting to generate export-led growth. The response will also consider the analysis which underpins the promotion of foreign direct investment by multinational companies
L2 (10–13) for an answer that discusses policies that can be used to promote economic growth but does not explain export-led growth and does not distinguish between export led growth and internal methods of achieving growth. Also there would be no attempt to put into the context of a developing economy.
L1 (1–9) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory

Venezuela is suffering the worst economic crisis in its history. Ordinary people in this oil-rich country are regularly going without food. Angry, hungry mobs are queuing outside almost empty supermarkets. The government has declared a state of emergency, food is being transported under armed guard, and basic necessities are being rationed. People have to queue for hours and sometimes overnight to receive basic commodities, such as rice and cooking oil.
Venezuela has the largest known oil reserves in the world — even greater than Saudi Arabia. In the past the government used money from oil exports to fund its own expenditure and to support domestic consumption. In addition, more than 1200 private companies in a wide range of sectors, such as sugar plantations and dairy farms, were nationalised. But in 2015 the oil price fell by 50% and this resulted in a shortage of money to fund government spending. The government maintained their spending by printing money, fuelling inflation. 
As Venezuela’s currency, the bolivar, was losing value, those holding bolivars increasingly exchanged them for US dollars. As a result, a restriction was placed upon those who could legally buy US dollars and the exchange rate was fixed. Unable to buy US dollars legally, businesses turned to the black market, where the value of the US dollar soared. While the official exchange rate is 10 bolivars per US dollar, the bolivar now trades on the black market at more than 1000 bolivars per US dollar. The collapse of the currency is made worse by oil’s continuing low price — Venezuela can no longer rely on its oil exports bringing back enough US dollars, which means it can’t import enough goods, leading to shortages. 
The government tried to ration basic foodstuffs and fix their prices, but as a result it became unprofitable for Venezuelan companies to make such things, and as a consequence they have simply disappeared from the shops into other illegal markets.

        Question: Governments and markets
Prices, according to economists, are determined by supply and demand. In many times and places, however, prices have been set by governments. For example, in January 2020, the government of Argentina updated its list of maximum prices, setting guidelines for over 300 products. Consumers, via a smartphone app, can report any prices of these products that are above the maximum.
The World Bank has collected data on the extent to which the governments of developing economies have intervened in markets to set prices. Table 1.1 shows the results of this research.
Table 1.1: Government intervention in product markets to influence prices in developing economies

Source: Adapted from 'In a fix', The Economist, 11 January 2020
Governments generally impose price controls for one of three reasons:

to redistribute income in an economy: maximum prices help the poor afford the necessities of life, whereas minimum prices support the livelihoods of farmers
to stabilise a market: governments use stocks to smooth fluctuations in the price of a commodity like cocoa, buying when there is excess supply in the market and selling when there is excess demand
to control inflation: maximum prices have been used in many countries

Many economists have been critical of the use of price controls by governments. In a market without government intervention, a product's price acts as a signal of its scarcity and an incentive to overcome scarcity. However, minimum prices can lead to food rotting in warehouses while maximum prices can lead to hoarding and black markets. 
Another reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be very unpopular. For example, in Santiago, the capital city of Chile, an increase in the minimum price on the public transport system led to widespread unrest in 2019. In the same year, the government of Iran decided to raise the minimum price of fuel sharply and suddenly, leading to a great deal of protest.
A representative of the World Bank has stated that one reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be hard to remove, expressing the view that 'it is better not to have them in the first place.'

Effective minimum price:

a minimum price in a market is where a price floor is established
to be effective, this needs to be above the equilibrium price
the equilibrium price in a market would be higher than would be the case if there was no government intervention
farmers are therefore guaranteed these prices
this is likely to have a positive effect on their incomes
it could lead to excess supply/surplus

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.

        Question: Trade tensions between China and the United States
At a World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland in 2017, the Chinese President re-affirmed his country's commitment to free trade and pledged never to start a protectionist 'trade war' or to benefit from a devaluation of its currency, the yuan. Meanwhile, the United States (US) President stated that the 'America First' doctrine means increased protectionism and he repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs and import quotas on Chinese goods. 
During 2016, the value of the US dollar rose against most currencies. In contrast, the Chinese yuan weakened significantly from 6.20 yuan per US dollar at the end of 2014 to 6.95 yuan at the end of 2016. The US President has accused China of intentionally devaluing the yuan in order to boost China's export competitiveness. Despite strong downward pressure on its currency, China has attempted to keep the yuan–US dollar exchange rate relatively stable, costing more than US$2 trillion of its official foreign exchange reserves. China has stated that it does not want the yuan to fall in value any more than the US does, but no country has complete control over its exchange rate.
China, like Japan and Germany, usually has a current account surplus on the balance of payments, but China's current account surplus as a percentage of GDP fell in 2016 and the International Monetary Fund expects it to decrease further, as exports continue to fall.
There are three policy paths that a country can follow with regard to its exchange rate: a completely free float, a managed float or a fixed (pegged) exchange rate. Each of these has various advantages and disadvantages. At present, China's policy is a managed float, but some economists have argued that it is the yuan–US dollar exchange rate that is regarded as being especially important and so it might be better if China decided to fix (peg) the yuan to the dollar. Fig. 1.1 shows the yuan–US dollar exchange rate over three years.

Meanwhile, the United States (US) President stated that the 'America First' doctrine means increased protectionism and he repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs and import quotas on Chinese goods. 
During 2016, the value of the US dollar rose against most currencies. In contrast, the Chinese yuan weakened significantly from 6.20 yuan per US dollar at the end of 2014 to 6.95 yuan at the end of 2016. The US President has accused China of intentionally devaluing the yuan in order to boost China's export competitiveness. Despite strong downward pressure on its currency, China has attempted to keep the yuan–US dollar exchange rate relatively stable, costing more than US$2 trillion of its official foreign exchange reserves. China has stated that it does not want the yuan to fall in value any more than the US does, but no country has complete control over its exchange rate.
China, like Japan and Germany, usually has a current account surplus on the balance of payments, but China's current account surplus as a percentage of GDP fell in 2016 and the International Monetary Fund expects it to decrease further, as exports continue to fall.
There are three policy paths that a country can follow with regard to its exchange rate: a completely free float, a managed float or a fixed (pegged) exchange rate. Each of these has various advantages and disadvantages. At present, China's policy is a managed float, but some economists have argued that it is the yuan–US dollar exchange rate that is regarded as being especially important and so it might be better if China decided to fix (peg) the yuan to the dollar. Fig. 1.1 shows the yuan–US dollar exchange rate over three years.

        Question: Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Pakistan's agriculture survives on subsidies
As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

The higher cost of production in Pakistan has serious implications for Pakistan's participation in global trade in agricultural products. This problem is particularly critical as Pakistan seeks to increase exports to reduce a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.
A complaint of farmers is that GST, a sales tax, is charged when they purchase fertilisers. In May, the government gave in to pressure and cut GST on fertilisers from 17% to 2%. Farmers' leaders want the tax to be completely removed from fertiliser sales. Their priority, however, is for a large increase in the subsidy paid to farmers to a level comparable to that paid to farmers in India. In Pakistan's current economic position this prospect appears to be remote.
Pakistan's farmers also complain about the subsidies that are paid to farmers in richer neighbouring countries. They strongly argue that these subsidies are unfair on farmers from developing countries and are holding back their economic development.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: The changing market for avocados
The global consumption of avocados has increased in the last few years, particularly in the United States (US) but also in China and parts of Europe. This growth is largely due to the increasing popularity of ‘guacamole’ (smashed avocado) and the health benefits claimed for its regular consumption. The US is the largest importer of avocados with supplies coming mainly from Central and South American producers as shown in Fig. 1.1.
Source: Avacados show growth in volume, www.thepacker.com 
Fig. 1.1: US Avocado imports by country, 2010 to 2018
The supply of avocados is unpredictable. It is estimated that to produce one kilogram of avocado requires 2000 litres of water. Consequently, production is highly susceptible to drought conditions such as those that affected Central American growers in 2018. When this happens, the price of avocados increases as shown in Fig. 1.2.
Source: Mexican Ministry of Economy
Fig. 1.2: Wholesale price of Mexican avocados in the US,January to July 2019 (pesos per 10kg box)
A shortage in supply provides an opportunity for new producers to enter the global market. Kenya, for example, has expanded its productive capacity and signed an agreement to supply the Chinese market. Even some New Zealand farmers switched from dairy to avocado production. 
The global market for avocados is expected to continue to grow over the next few years. Rising prices will continue to increase production. It should be recognised, however, that there are increasing objections to higher production. In Mexico, for example, farmers have cleared forests to cultivate more avocados. This has put a strain on water supplies and raised concerns about the effects of the farmers’ actions on climate change. These concerns have led one market research report to conclude that ‘the price mechanism is not working to allocate resources successfully.’

The question implies that an explanation of changes in demand and supply over the period April to July 2019 is required. So, no marks should be awarded for the usual general demand and supply factors.Demand side: new research into health benefits of avocados, buying for a special event e.g., Superbowl, panic buying. These changes will lead to a shift to the right of the demand curve.
Supply side: bad weather in Mexico leads to less supply; increased demand elsewhere reduces supply available to USA leading to a shift to the left of the supply curve

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

        Question: Problems in the steel industry
By 2016, China’s steel industry had expanded rapidly and accounted for just over half of world production but China’s economy had huge excess capacity: 30% in the case of steel which led to cheap export prices. Chinese economic growth in real terms was slowing and aggregate supply was greater than aggregate demand. Profit margins were already small but the collapse of world steel prices which fell significantly in 2015 (as shown in Fig. 1.1) worsened the situation.
The dumping of cheap Chinese imports of steel caused problems for the United Kingdom (UK) steel industry. There were thousands of job losses at three major steel factories which was devastating news for UK steel workers and the regional economies.
Some argued that despite this there was no case for the UK Government to intervene to save the steel factories.
Steel is used in the construction industry and in the production of cars, household appliances and many other goods. Companies that use steel are much more numerous than companies that produce it. If steel prices are low, the costs of companies that use steel are reduced. So there should be no complaints or pleas for government intervention about supposedly unfair competition from cut-price imports.
Industrial policy is a valid aim of government when it comes to identifying market failures. There iseven a strong case for rescuing industries that face temporary external shocks, such as occurred with the United States (US) Government’s rescue of Chrysler and General Motors in 2008 as the economy fell into deep recession. For steel, however, it is a buyers’ market. The closure of unprofitable steel factories is not a market failure at all. It is a reflection of costs being too high and the industry being uncompetitive. Rescuing steel factories with public money would do nothing to alleviate the problem of overcapacity. It would divert scarce resources from more productive uses such as long term investment in infrastructure.

        ","Problems in the steel industry
By 2016, China’s steel industry had expanded rapidly and accounted for just over half of world production but China’s economy had huge excess capacity: 30% in the case of steel which led to cheap export prices. Chinese economic growth in real terms was slowing and aggregate supply was greater than aggregate demand. Profit margins were already small but the collapse of world steel prices which fell significantly in 2015 (as shown in Fig. 1.1) worsened the situation.
The dumping of cheap Chinese imports of steel caused problems for the United Kingdom (UK) steel industry. There were thousands of job losses at three major steel factories which was devastating news for UK steel workers and the regional economies.
Some argued that despite this there was no case for the UK Government to intervene to save the steel factories.
Steel is used in the construction industry and in the production of cars, household appliances and many other goods. Companies that use steel are much more numerous than companies that produce it. If steel prices are low, the costs of companies that use steel are reduced. So there should be no complaints or pleas for government intervention about supposedly unfair competition from cut-price imports.
Industrial policy is a valid aim of government when it comes to identifying market failures. There iseven a strong case for rescuing industries that face temporary external shocks, such as occurred with the United States (US) Government’s rescue of Chrysler and General Motors in 2008 as the economy fell into deep recession. For steel, however, it is a buyers’ market. The closure of unprofitable steel factories is not a market failure at all. It is a reflection of costs being too high and the industry being uncompetitive. Rescuing steel factories with public money would do nothing to alleviate the problem of overcapacity. It would divert scarce resources from more productive uses such as long term investment in infrastructure.

Variable costs change with output; fixed costs do not – and are constant in the short run. (1–2)Steel could affect either, depending on what it is used for but it is more likely to affect variable costs. (1–2)

        Question: Is Nigeria being held back by its dependence on oil and gas?
Nigeria has about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of young people in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic, particularly due to the steep decline in oil prices. Nationally, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, while another 25% are vulnerable and could fall into poverty due to the pandemic.
Oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria’s export revenues, a dominant position that it has occupied since the 1970s. Many people believe that Nigeria needs to move further away from its dependence on oil and natural gas. Initial attempts at diversification have produced limited gains as the policies have been aimed mainly at the domestic market to create jobs and to improve living standards. There needs to be a focus on export‑orientated manufacturing that should boost economic growth as it has done in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
Based on the experience of these countries, more open trade and competition policies would help to diversify the economy, especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) takes effect. Nigeria needs to create at least five million new jobs each year to employ its growing population of young people.

Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 2020 due to fall in crude oil prices caused by falling global demand and measures to fight the spread of COVID‑19. Inflation rose in 2020 due mainly to higher food prices, the removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in the price of electricity. The budget deficit also worsened in 2020 because the COVID‑19 pandemic caused higher government spending and lower tax revenues, adding to the national debt.
Nigeria’s national debt is sustainable at 25% of GDP, but interest payments are high, accounting for about 50% of government spending. Nigeria’s government could improve its finances by reforming domestic tax collection. Non‑oil tax revenue is equivalent to just 4% of GDP. An increase in the rate of value‑added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 resulted in less revenue than forecast because of the recession. A wider tax base could help the budget, but this will require significant reform to reduce both tax evasion and a large informal economy.

Consider the extent to which the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria would lead to an increase in inflation. [4] ","c

Consider the extent to which the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria would lead to an increase in inflation.

For an explanation of why the removal of subsidies is likely to lead to an increase in the price of fuel e.g., by increasing the cost of producing and / or supplying fuel or by shifting the supply curve to the left to its original position. (1)
For an explanation of why this is likely to lead to an increase in inflation / a rise in the price level e.g., fuel will have a high weighting in the measurement of inflation / PED is likely to be inelastic/ it is an important cost of production that affects the price of many other products / it may lead to cost-push inflation. (1)
For an explanation of why this may lead to continuing inflation e.g., as price rises, wage demands fuel further inflation / may lead to an increase in the price level for a much wider range of products. (1)

For some evaluation of the overall impact e.g., the inflationary impact may be offset by the fact that: (1)

there is a reduction in other costs/prices OR
PED may in fact be elastic leading to a fall in demand and therefore prices rise but at a lower rate OR
It also may depend on the size of the original subsidy.

Accept any other valid reason why the inflationary impact may be offset.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Explain any two policies that could improve the competitiveness of rice from Myanmar and Cambodia in the EU market. [4]

        Question Type: Data Response, A-Level, 4 marks
        ","Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

Venezuela is suffering the worst economic crisis in its history. Ordinary people in this oil-rich country are regularly going without food. Angry, hungry mobs are queuing outside almost empty supermarkets. The government has declared a state of emergency, food is being transported under armed guard, and basic necessities are being rationed. People have to queue for hours and sometimes overnight to receive basic commodities, such as rice and cooking oil.
Venezuela has the largest known oil reserves in the world — even greater than Saudi Arabia. In the past the government used money from oil exports to fund its own expenditure and to support domestic consumption. In addition, more than 1200 private companies in a wide range of sectors, such as sugar plantations and dairy farms, were nationalised. But in 2015 the oil price fell by 50% and this resulted in a shortage of money to fund government spending. The government maintained their spending by printing money, fuelling inflation. 
As Venezuela’s currency, the bolivar, was losing value, those holding bolivars increasingly exchanged them for US dollars. As a result, a restriction was placed upon those who could legally buy US dollars and the exchange rate was fixed. Unable to buy US dollars legally, businesses turned to the black market, where the value of the US dollar soared. While the official exchange rate is 10 bolivars per US dollar, the bolivar now trades on the black market at more than 1000 bolivars per US dollar. The collapse of the currency is made worse by oil’s continuing low price — Venezuela can no longer rely on its oil exports bringing back enough US dollars, which means it can’t import enough goods, leading to shortages. 
The government tried to ration basic foodstuffs and fix their prices, but as a result it became unprofitable for Venezuelan companies to make such things, and as a consequence they have simply disappeared from the shops into other illegal markets.

        Question: Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla 



Ice cream producers can use natural vanilla or vanillin to produce ice cream.





Explain why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be relatively more elastic than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with natural vanilla. [4]

For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

        Question: Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

        Question: The Lagos economy is working
Nigeria discovered oil 50 years ago and is now the world's sixth biggest oil exporter. The recent increase in global oil prices has had a very large positive effect on the country's balance of trade and has also improved the country's terms of trade.
Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria, with a population of over 20 million, and has undergone a successful economic transformation in recent years. It has used the private sector to become the most productive and dynamic part of Nigeria's economy. The owner of one of Nigeria's largest companies has stressed the enormous economic progress that the country has made in recent years: ""I'm a great believer in Nigeria because the opportunities here are enormous."" His company's success shows what private enterprise can achieve in a mixed economy especially if it is provided with the right incentives by the government.
Most Nigerian entrepreneurs are operating in Lagos and entrepreneurship has certainlyplayed a key role in the modern Lagos economy. Start-up initiatives have been encouragedand the need to be innovative has been increasingly recognised, leading to the developmentof new goods, services and markets. The city is the centre of thriving music, fashion, film andtechnology industries that have significant influence throughout Africa.
A 'free trade zone' on the edge of Lagos has been established where private sector firms pay no business taxes to the government and there are now numerous start-up enterprises that are thriving. The government aims to lower costs, reduce bureaucracy and make the economy more flexible and efficient with the hope of boosting trade. The zone is located next to a deep sea port and has good road connections with both the rest of Nigeria and other countries in the region.
Lagos is an important transport hub, with three major ports and West Africa's most important international airport. In 2016 the output of Lagos was valued at US$136 billion while Nigeria's total national output was valued at US$405 billion. 
A former governor of the Nigerian central bank, has stated: ""Since 2000, Lagos has been transformed. In terms of an improved infrastructure and a supportive economic environment, the government has given firms a greater opportunity to thrive.""

Extract 1: World export prices of maize fall sharply
Export prices of maize declined further in April 2020, with the United States (US) maize price nearly 10% down from April 2019. It is now at the lowest value in more than ten years. Large global supplies and good harvest prospects in South America continue to reduce prices. In addition, lower demand for maize from the biofuel and animal feed industries is depressing the price further.
Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 12/05/2020
Extract 2: Zimbabwe takes steps to curb the rise in maize prices
Despite a falling world price for maize, the price of this staple food in Zimbabwe has continued to increase and is now at an exceptionally high level. The increased price mostly results from continued weakness in Zimbabwe’s currency that has damaged the country’s ability to import maize. In addition, the sharply reduced harvest of maize in Zimbabwe resulted in low domestic supplies. In an effort to tackle the soaring prices, the government has implemented several policies. To increase market supplies, the government removed a ban on imports of certain types of maize. It also increased producer subsidies on maize by 40%. Poorer households should benefit from access to this subsidised maize.

Extract 3: Malawi raises guaranteed minimum price for maize 
Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture has released updated guaranteed prices for cereals produced on Malawi's farms in 2020. These are the minimum prices that farmers will receive for their crops. The guaranteed price for the food staple, maize, was raised by just over 10%. The government has begun purchasing maize at this increased price. This change in the minimum price is expected to increase the production of maize in 2020 and in the future to an average level of 3.7 million tonnes per year.

        Question: Pakistan's agriculture survives on subsidies
As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

The higher cost of production in Pakistan has serious implications for Pakistan's participation in global trade in agricultural products. This problem is particularly critical as Pakistan seeks to increase exports to reduce a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.
A complaint of farmers is that GST, a sales tax, is charged when they purchase fertilisers. In May, the government gave in to pressure and cut GST on fertilisers from 17% to 2%. Farmers' leaders want the tax to be completely removed from fertiliser sales. Their priority, however, is for a large increase in the subsidy paid to farmers to a level comparable to that paid to farmers in India. In Pakistan's current economic position this prospect appears to be remote.
Pakistan's farmers also complain about the subsidies that are paid to farmers in richer neighbouring countries. They strongly argue that these subsidies are unfair on farmers from developing countries and are holding back their economic development.

        Question: Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""

        Question Type: Data Response, A-Level, 4 marks
        ","Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

        Question: Difficult times for OPEC and Nigeria
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has 13 members and produces over 30 million barrels of oil a day, responsible for half of global production. Its members, strongly influenced by Saudi Arabia, seek to limit the supply of oil in order to sustain stable prices to aid their own economic development.
OPEC members have become concerned about the increase in oil production in the United States (US) due to the use of fracking (a new technique for extracting oil) and its impact on world oil prices and OPEC's own market share. In 2014, OPEC decided to increase its own supply of oil in a bid to bankrupt higher-cost US producers. The effects were remarkable. A 12% increase in OPEC's production saw the world price fall by around 60% to less than US$30 per barrel. This was much lower than US producers' costs but it led to a 45% cut in OPEC's oil revenue.
In late 2016, it was clear that governments in OPEC countries were suffering from reduced oil revenues. There was also growing evidence that US oil producers had been able to cut costs to remain competitive with OPEC, even though the world price was still well below US$50 per barrel. This was thought to be the minimum price for producing oil in the US. In a surprising change of policy, OPEC decided to cut its oil production by 3%. The result was a 10% increase in the world price of oil.
Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. It produces around 8% of OPEC's total oil supply which accounts for over 80% of Nigeria's export revenue. Nigeria's economy has been seriously affected by OPEC's decision to increase supply on the world market. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a measure of total national output, has continued to fall along with oil output. The slowdown in the economy has affected taxation paid to the government. In addition import restrictions have been put in place to try to offset a severe shortage of foreign currency.

In 2014, OPEC's policy has been to increase its supply of oil on the world market. This can be represented by a shift to the right of the world supply curve, producing a new equilibrium position with a lower price but an increase in the quantity of oil traded. In 2016, OPEC decided to reduce supply. This can be shown with a shift to the left of the world supply curve, leading to a fall in supply and a rise in the world price. Two correct diagrams or a combined diagram is acceptable.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Fig. 1.1 Vietnam's current account balance, Q1 2016 to Q2 2018 (US$ million)
Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

Extract 1: World export prices of maize fall sharply
Export prices of maize declined further in April 2020, with the United States (US) maize price nearly 10% down from April 2019. It is now at the lowest value in more than ten years. Large global supplies and good harvest prospects in South America continue to reduce prices. In addition, lower demand for maize from the biofuel and animal feed industries is depressing the price further.
Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 12/05/2020
Extract 2: Zimbabwe takes steps to curb the rise in maize prices
Despite a falling world price for maize, the price of this staple food in Zimbabwe has continued to increase and is now at an exceptionally high level. The increased price mostly results from continued weakness in Zimbabwe’s currency that has damaged the country’s ability to import maize. In addition, the sharply reduced harvest of maize in Zimbabwe resulted in low domestic supplies. In an effort to tackle the soaring prices, the government has implemented several policies. To increase market supplies, the government removed a ban on imports of certain types of maize. It also increased producer subsidies on maize by 40%. Poorer households should benefit from access to this subsidised maize.

Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture has released updated guaranteed prices for cereals produced on Malawi's farms in 2020. These are the minimum prices that farmers will receive for their crops. The guaranteed price for the food staple, maize, was raised by just over 10%. The government has begun purchasing maize at this increased price. This change in the minimum price is expected to increase the production of maize in 2020 and in the future to an average level of 3.7 million tonnes per year.

Extract 2 states that the two reasons are 'sustained weakness in Zimbabwe's currency' and the 'sharply reduced harvest'. These need to be identified and explained. Only accept valid reasons contained in extract 2 that explicitly refer to Zimbabwe. The explanation should develop into why this reason will cause the price of maize to rise in Zimbabwe.
Relevant diagrams should only be rewarded if used as part of the explanation.

        Question: Romania's economy booms
Romania, like other former planned economies in eastern Europe has increased the amount of private enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in its economy. Romania's economy has boomed in recent years and compares favourably with economies in the European Union (EU) as indicated in Fig. 1.1.

This economic boom has been characterised by the expansion of services and manufacturing sectors. In particular the high-tech industries have been very successful and are expected to double their contribution to GDP to 12% by 2025. The low wage rate in Romania was a benefit for foreign companies. For example, global car companies have, since 2008, invested US$1.4 billion in Romania’s car factories that has increased employment. 
After Romania joined the EU in 2007, many Romanian workers took advantage of the free movement of labour the EU allows. In 2008, 600000 out of a population of 21.2m left Romania. In spite of its economic boom, Romania has failed to attract sufficient workers back and there is now a shortage of labour. The total population is lower than in 2008 at 19.4m. Unemployment was only 5.9% in 2017 compared with an average rate of 8.6% for the EU as a whole. 
Since 2015, the government has taken measures to boost the economy. It reduced sales tax from 24% to 19%, which increased consumer demand. It also doubled the national minimum wage providing a boost for both private sector and public sector employment. 
But there are also serious economic challenges. The gap between government income and spending has widened causing a rising budget deficit. The transport infrastructure remains poor. In a World Economic Forum report in 2016, Romania was ranked 128th out of 138 countries for the quality of its road network and 79th for its railway system.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Fiscal policy would require a government to use taxation and government expenditure changes to influence key macroeconomic goals such as inflation, economic growth and the level of employment.
An output gap will show the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.
A negative output will indicate that there is spare capacity in an economy which will be primarily due to insufficient aggregate monetary demand. A relevant diagram can be used to illustrate this gap.
Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to significantly influence aggregate demand by either increase its expenditure or reducing the overall level of taxation.
A budget deficit will inject additional demand into an economy which will have a magnified effect on output, income and employment due to the positive contribution of a multiplier effect.

AO3 Evaluation

Fiscal policy could help to close a negative output gap by increasing a government’s budget deficit but this may lead to higher interest rates and crowding out in the private sector.
It is difficult for a government to produce an accurate forecast of the magnitude of the output gap.
Although a budget deficit might help to reduce a negative output gap in the short run, if the deficit is financed by increasing the money supply, this might lead to inflation in the long run.
Alternative policies such as supply-side policies might be more effective by closing the output gap while avoiding the risk of inflation in the long run.
Expansionary fiscal policies used to close an output gap might lead to an increase in the demand for imports and subsequently, a negative impact on the country’s balance of payments.
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

Low – income countries might increase productivity due the transfer of new technology from high income countries, however this might lead to a substitution of capital for labour thus increasing the level of unemployment. 
An increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) might lead to the exploitation of the indigenous raw materials, thus leading to a long run decline in economic growth. 
Increases in productivity might provide opportunities to create more real wealth but it will still depend upon a government in a low – income country to ensure that any increases in wealth lead to equitable outcomes. 

It is relatively easy to link an increase in productivity to the availability of more goods, however living standards are also influenced by an increase in the provision of services such as health and education. It is not easy to measure change 

In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for an increase in productivity to influence living standards in low re – income countries but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have a less direct positive impact. 

Accept all valid responses. 

The links between an increase in FDI and GDP and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by MNCs in lowincome countries. The majority of MNC profit might be repatriated rather than re – invested in the low re – income country. 
Higher skilled work might be provided separately by the MNC therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place. In some cases it has been argued that MNCs extract key resources and then leave.
It is not certain that a government will use the increase in tax revenue to invested in key sectors such as health, education and the country’s infrastructure. 
es in productivity in relation to services such as health and education.
A government in a low-income economy has to decide whether to allow FDI into their economy which might produce short – term benefits but result in long re – term consequences of resource depletion in the long run. 
It is very difficult to measure changes in living standards. Increases in GDP might not be divided equally among the population. FDIs might introduce external costs of production which are likely to have a negative effect on overall living standards. 
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for FDIs to improve   living standards but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negative impact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not focus entirely on an increase in access to material goods and services.

Assumptions of indifference curve analysis including:
rational consumers who prefer more to less,
a two-good world,
the prices of the goods are (initially) constant,
the goods can be substituted for each other,
transitivity, if there is indifference between A and B and indifference between B and C, there is indifference between A and C
perfect knowledge of the market.
Definition of an indifference curve (IC), explanation of convex IC and analysis of rising levels of satisfaction and the creation of an IC map.
Definition of a budget line (BL) and analysis of rising/falling income levels on the BL and consumption
Explanation of the substitution effect (SE) and the income effect (YE) when the price of a good changes.
Analysis of the effect of a positive and negative YE when combined with the SE to account for a normal and inferior good.
The combination of the IC and BL maps to show point of tangency between IC and BL to give a combination of the 2 goods that gives the highest level of satisfaction given the level of income. 

AO3 Evaluation

Consumer rationality: indifference analysis assumes that consumers act rationally. They are of a calculating mind, carrying numerous combinations of different commodities in their heads, can substitute one for the other, compare their total utilities and make a rational choice between various combinations of goods.
As the effect of a reduction in price is an increase in demand for both a normal and inferior good (except in the case of Giffen good) it is not possible to know whether a good is normal or inferior.
It is difficult to apply the concept of substitutability to goods such as consumable durables, which are one-off indivisible purchases and the choice is between, for example, 1 fridge and 4 weeks’ food.
A consumer is faced with a much more complex world than the two-good world of the model because a consumer buys not just two but a large number of commodities to satisfy their innumerable wants.
IC analysis is a static analysis and consumer preferences may change over time.

Characteristics of a monopolistically competitive market should be described.
Difference between short run and long run profit maximizing output in monopolistically competitive markets.
A monopoly market should be described, including main characteristics and key difference between this type of market and monopolistic competition i.e. barriers to entry.
Different types of efficiency should be identified and explained.
Analysis should discuss the links between monopoly and higher prices and inefficiency. This analysis can then be used to compare both monopoly and monopolistically competitive markets.
Analysis should then be used to compare short run and long run outcomes on both types of market. 

AO3 Evaluation

Some monopolies might invest in new technology and achieve dynamic efficiency. This will enable lower average total costs and an opportunity to pass the benefits of lower costs on in the form of lower prices.
Similarly, monopolies might benefit from economies of scale which might also lead to lower prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms might incur additional costs through the need to engage in non-price competition. This might lead to higher prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms will achieve productive efficiency in the long run but a profit maximizing firm will not operate at an allocatively efficient level of output.
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement by addressing both price levels and efficiency outcomes in relation to both types of market structure. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition and explanation of long-term economic growth as a function of more inputs such as labour, land, and equipment creating an outwards shift of the productive possibility curve. Economic growth is measurable in terms of increases in real GDP.
Many developing countries are characterised by low incomes which prevent savings and the funds needed to finance investment and economic growth. Funding is needed to finance the investment and technological aspects of economic growth which comes from internal sources (savings) or from foreign lending/investment.
Foreign investment may be from governments (e.g. China’s Belt and Roads initiative), international agencies (e.g. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) or sovereign wealth funds. Governments borrow from other governments and international agencies to invest in infrastructure and other development projects which under lie economic growth.
Private capital investment via multinational corporations (e.g. Toyota, Intel). MNC investment is usually in factories, plant and machinery which increase output directly.
Candidates may analyse the effects of the increase in investment through aggregate supply and demand analysis.
Successful investment requires a return (marginal efficiency of capital (MEC)) which exceeds the rate of interest that has been relatively easy to obtain.
The effects of rising interest rates on developing countries: Many developing countries will suffer from falling exchange rates, especially if US$ interest rates rise this will increase the US$ funding cost of borrowings. The balance of payments (X-M) will deteriorate.
Accept references to IMF and World Bank lending investment funds.

AO3 Evaluation

Impact depends on the proportion of funding which comes from abroad and how much is locally sourced. If domestic funds are not available, then how else will the growth be funded.
The quality of the investment projects and the likelihood of realising a profit will affect the ability to cover the increase in interest rates. In some cases ‘vanity projects’ with little long-term economic benefit are funded (Roads to Nowhere) which enhance the standing of the government amongst its supporters but have no economic benefit.
The short-term effects of the project in terms of raising aggregate demand may be of limited benefit to the borrower if the lender requires much of the construction and materials to be sourced from them. This will have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments.
Higher interest rates in high income countries will raise the cost of borrowing by the low-income country. This means the cost of financing projects has risen representing an opportunity cost for borrowing. The balance of payments current account will deteriorate as the higher interest is paid.
Many low-income countries may be affected by a commodity price slump which reduces export earnings and depreciates a floating exchange rate making interest rate and capital repayment more expensive.

Fiscal policy would require a government to use taxation and government expenditure changes to influence key macroeconomic goals such as inflation, economic growth and the level of employment.
An output gap will show the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.
A negative output will indicate that there is spare capacity in an economy which will be primarily due to insufficient aggregate monetary demand. A relevant diagram can be used to illustrate this gap.
Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to significantly influence aggregate demand by either increase its expenditure or reducing the overall level of taxation.
A budget deficit will inject additional demand into an economy which will have a magnified effect on output, income and employment due to the positive contribution of a multiplier effect.

AO3 Evaluation

Fiscal policy could help to close a negative output gap by increasing a government’s budget deficit but this may lead to higher interest rates and crowding out in the private sector.
It is difficult for a government to produce an accurate forecast of the magnitude of the output gap.
Although a budget deficit might help to reduce a negative output gap in the short run, if the deficit is financed by increasing the money supply, this might lead to inflation in the long run.
Alternative policies such as supply-side policies might be more effective by closing the output gap while avoiding the risk of inflation in the long run.
Expansionary fiscal policies used to close an output gap might lead to an increase in the demand for imports and subsequently, a negative impact on the country’s balance of payments.
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC or MSB = MSC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency. 
Negative externalities occur when the when the consumption/use of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that received by an individual producer MPB > MSB or MSC >MPC. This is sometimes described as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect. The negative externality leads to an over production of the good.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-consumption of a good or service. 
Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised. 
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies for consumers to increase consumption and also producers to change production methods, use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services such as alternative transport methods. Indirect taxation. Nudge theory effects. 
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive/negative externality on the level of output and the welfare change will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a negative consumption externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the negative externality is taken into account. The diagram may be amended or re-drawn to show the impact of a chosen policy(ies) and the impact on consumption or production shown. 
Reference to the diagram and the outcomes it illustrates is made in the text. 

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy. 
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached. 
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces. 
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

The concepts of increasing/constant/decreasing returns to scale and the minimum efficient scale (MES) of production the level of output where LRAC are initially minimized. 
The explanation of a number of examples of economies of scale: division of labour, financial, marketing, managerial technical and their impact on the long run average cost curve (LRAC). 
An analysis of the relationship between total demand for a product and the minimum efficient scale effectively total demand divided by MES to give the maximum number of firms who could operate at the MES. 
A description of different forms of market structure eg perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly or monopoly. 
An analysis of the relationship between the MES and the market demand determining the number of firms many/a few/one equivalent to perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly or monopoly. 
Examples MES and market demand. MES = 50% therefore in theory 2 firms – a duopoly MES 2% therefore 50 firms perfect/monopolistic competition. 
Relevant diagram for economies of scale with indication of MES and demand curve. 

AO3 Evaluation

MES is not static and may change over time eg technological change. 
The definition of the market will affect the calculation of the relationship. The village shop which operates at a small scale is appropriate for the village market. 
Markets will still exist where particular firms produce small scale highcost items e.g. luxury cars or designer clothes to satisfy a niche portion of a bigger market.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

A perfect labour market would assume homogenous labour, perfect mobility, identical jobs, many buyers and sellers of labour and perfect information. This would mean that each firm’s supply of labour would be perfectly elastic and a wage taker.
In perfect labour markets the wage that has to be taken by each firm will be determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the industry.
Imperfect labour markets might occur due to the intervention of trade unions or government. A monopsony, single buyer of labour would also lead to market failure. 
Market failure associated with imperfect markets will often result in lower wages and/or higher levels of unemployment.
Intervention by trade unions by controlling the supply of labour might lead to higher wages but this is likely to cause higher levels of unemployment. A diagram that illustrates supply of and demand for labour showing a decrease in supply will illustrate this potential outcome.
A government might impose a minimum wage above the market equilibrium wage which would also result in higher wages but would be accompanied by higher levels of unemployment. This analysis would be supported by an accurate, clearly labelled diagram plus an explanation. 
A monopsony firm would employ labour where the marginal cost of labour was equal to the marginal revenue product of labour. This would potentially lead to both lower wages and higher levels of unemployment. An accurately labelled diagram plus an explanation would support this conclusion.

AO3 Evaluation

In some circumstance it is possible for trade unions to increase labour productivity through increased training. This would increase the demand for labour by increasing the marginal productivity of labour which would enable both higher wages and higher levels of employment to be attained. This can be illustrated by a supporting diagram and further explanation.
The negative impact of imposing a minimum wage on the level of employment will depend upon the relative elasticities of the demand for and supply of labour. If the demand and supply are relatively inelastic then it would be possible to introduce a relatively high minimum wage which will not have a significant impact on the level of employment.
It is possible for trade unions to intervene in monopsonistic markets and undertake bilateral wage negotiations. Depending on the respective bargaining strengths of the union and monopsony, it might be possible for collective bargaining to raise both wages and employment. A supporting diagram plus an explanation would illustrate this potential outcome. 
In some circumstances a government might need to intervene to maintain the provision of vital public services as a priority, if trade unions attempt to increase wages through the withdrawal of labour. 
In conclusion it is possible to show that imperfect labour markets do not always lead to lower wages and a higher level of unemployment. Trade unions, through the power of collective bargaining, can counteract the negative effects of monopsony labour markets. Also trade unions can train labour to increase labour productivity to enable an increase in wages at the same time that employment levels are rising.

A definition of what is meant by inflation.
An explanation of what constitutes the key components of the money supply. This should primarily consist of commercial bank balances held at the central bank plus all bank deposits held in the commercial banks.
Examples of the instruments available to use by the central bank to control the money supply. Reference to and explanation of Open Market operations/Quantitative Easing, plus the use of changes in interest rates should be made and explained.
The potential link between changes in the money supply and/or changes in the rate of interest rate and inflation should be examined.
Analysis of the use of specific monetary policy instruments and their impact on reducing the money supply should be provided. For example, examining the links between the sale of long-term government securities and changes in the level of bank deposits.
Analysis of how changes in interest rates/money supply might impact upon the level of aggregate demand and inflation. 

AO3 Evaluation

The money supply is very difficult to measure, thus there are many different definitions of what might constitute the money supply.
The link between changes in the money and changes in the price level is not altogether clear.
The link between changes in the rate of interest and changes in the money supply are not always clear. For example, an increase in the rate of interest might lead to an increase in savings. This would cause bank deposits and therefore, the money supply to rise.
The effectiveness of the use of monetary policy to control inflation will also depend upon the cause of inflation. For example, demand pull inflation might be controlled more effectively by the use of contractionary fiscal policy.
A conclusion should use the preceding discussion to decide the extent to which this type of monetary is likely to be used effectively to control inflation.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition and explanation of long-term economic growth as a function of more inputs such as labour, land, and equipment creating an outwards shift of the productive possibility curve. Economic growth is measurable in terms of increases in real GDP.
Many developing countries are characterised by low incomes which prevent savings and the funds needed to finance investment and economic growth. Funding is needed to finance the investment and technological aspects of economic growth which comes from internal sources (savings) or from foreign lending/investment.
Foreign investment may be from governments (e.g. China’s Belt and Roads initiative), international agencies (e.g. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) or sovereign wealth funds. Governments borrow from other governments and international agencies to invest in infrastructure and other development projects which under lie economic growth.
Private capital investment via multinational corporations (e.g. Toyota, Intel). MNC investment is usually in factories, plant and machinery which increase output directly.
Candidates may analyse the effects of the increase in investment through aggregate supply and demand analysis.
Successful investment requires a return (marginal efficiency of capital (MEC)) which exceeds the rate of interest that has been relatively easy to obtain.
The effects of rising interest rates on developing countries: Many developing countries will suffer from falling exchange rates, especially if US$ interest rates rise this will increase the US$ funding cost of borrowings. The balance of payments (X-M) will deteriorate.
Accept references to IMF and World Bank lending investment funds.

AO3 Evaluation

Impact depends on the proportion of funding which comes from abroad and how much is locally sourced. If domestic funds are not available, then how else will the growth be funded.
The quality of the investment projects and the likelihood of realising a profit will affect the ability to cover the increase in interest rates. In some cases ‘vanity projects’ with little long-term economic benefit are funded (Roads to Nowhere) which enhance the standing of the government amongst its supporters but have no economic benefit.
The short-term effects of the project in terms of raising aggregate demand may be of limited benefit to the borrower if the lender requires much of the construction and materials to be sourced from them. This will have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments.
Higher interest rates in high income countries will raise the cost of borrowing by the low-income country. This means the cost of financing projects has risen representing an opportunity cost for borrowing. The balance of payments current account will deteriorate as the higher interest is paid.
Many low-income countries may be affected by a commodity price slump which reduces export earnings and depreciates a floating exchange rate making interest rate and capital repayment more expensive.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primarygoods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to beachieved.
Globalization through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth. 
Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard ofliving.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between globalisation and GDP and an increase in living standards in low-income countries are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by more advanced, higher income countries. inlow- income countries
Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries
Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place.
In somecases, individual firms in low-income countries might be outcompeted and go out of business. Unemployment might then rise and living standards might fall.
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to improve the standard of living but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negativeimpact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not rely entirely on the material benefits gained by globalisation.

Assumptions of indifference curve analysis including:
rational consumers who prefer more to less,
a two-good world,
the prices of the goods are (initially) constant,
the goods can be substituted for each other,
transitivity, if there is indifference between A and B and indifference between B and C, there is indifference between A and C
perfect knowledge of the market.
Definition of an indifference curve (IC), explanation of convex IC and analysis of rising levels of satisfaction and the creation of an IC map.
Definition of a budget line (BL) and analysis of rising/falling income levels on the BL and consumption
Explanation of the substitution effect (SE) and the income effect (YE) when the price of a good changes.
Analysis of the effect of a positive and negative YE when combined with the SE to account for a normal and inferior good.
The combination of the IC and BL maps to show point of tangency between IC and BL to give a combination of the 2 goods that gives the highest level of satisfaction given the level of income. 

AO3 Evaluation

Consumer rationality: indifference analysis assumes that consumers act rationally. They are of a calculating mind, carrying numerous combinations of different commodities in their heads, can substitute one for the other, compare their total utilities and make a rational choice between various combinations of goods.
As the effect of a reduction in price is an increase in demand for both a normal and inferior good (except in the case of Giffen good) it is not possible to know whether a good is normal or inferior.
It is difficult to apply the concept of substitutability to goods such as consumable durables, which are one-off indivisible purchases and the choice is between, for example, 1 fridge and 4 weeks’ food.
A consumer is faced with a much more complex world than the two-good world of the model because a consumer buys not just two but a large number of commodities to satisfy their innumerable wants.
IC analysis is a static analysis and consumer preferences may change over time.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
High-income countries are likely to benefit from access to a wide range of goods and services and access to good health care and education.
Comparative advantage allows high-income countries to increase their standard of living by providing access to cheap raw materials produced in low-income countries.
Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries.

Assess the contribution of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the improvement of the standard of living in low-income countries.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion.

FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.
This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.
FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a lowincome economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living. 

However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run.
AO3 Evaluation

The links between globalization and the costs/benefits imposed on lowincome countries is not clear. For example, low-income countries might benefit significantly from the transfer of new technology from high income countries.
Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore helping to train the indigenous population.
Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth which can then be used to provide merit goods such as health care and education.
In some cases, individual firms in low-income countries might gain access to large markets in high-income countries which will subsequently allow new businesses to grow
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to benefit both high and low-income countries, but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall positive impact.

Use of a diagram to show the links between climate change and negative externalities
Analysis of how market forces can be used to address the consequences of climate change. 

L2 maximum if no accurate diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

The link between climate change on negative externalities is very difficult to accurately establish
It is also extremely difficult to measure negative externalities
The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all negative externalities because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.
The use of minimum prices to reduce negative externalities would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces.

Fiscal policy would require a government to use taxation and government expenditure changes to influence key macroeconomic goals such as inflation, economic growth and the level of employment.
An output gap will show the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.
A negative output will indicate that there is spare capacity in an economy which will be primarily due to insufficient aggregate monetary demand. A relevant diagram can be used to illustrate this gap.
Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to significantly influence aggregate demand by either increase its expenditure or reducing the overall level of taxation.
A budget deficit will inject additional demand into an economy which will have a magnified effect on output, income and employment due to the positive contribution of a multiplier effect.

AO3 Evaluation

Fiscal policy could help to close a negative output gap by increasing a government’s budget deficit but this may lead to higher interest rates and crowding out in the private sector.
It is difficult for a government to produce an accurate forecast of the magnitude of the output gap.
Although a budget deficit might help to reduce a negative output gap in the short run, if the deficit is financed by increasing the money supply, this might lead to inflation in the long run.
Alternative policies such as supply-side policies might be more effective by closing the output gap while avoiding the risk of inflation in the long run.
Expansionary fiscal policies used to close an output gap might lead to an increase in the demand for imports and subsequently, a negative impact on the country’s balance of payments.
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

A devaluation relates to a decision by a government to fix the exchange rate of its domestic currency at a new lower level.
A persistent balance of payments deficit on a country's current account in goods and services will create problems because it has to be financed. If it is not financed by positive currency flows on the financial account due to direct investment or portfolio investment, it will have to be financed by reducing its reserves of foreign currency. This particular problem will only apply to a country that has adopted a fixed exchange rate.
In this situation the difference between the short run and the long run will be determined by the time taken to reduce the deficit and will also be measured by the final impact on the general price level that is the rate of inflation.
A devaluation of the domestic currency will immediately make all exported goods cheaper and all imported goods more expensive. On this basis it is assumed more exports will be sold and fewer goods will be imported. This would then help to reduce a balance of payments deficit.
To some extent, the ability of domestic suppliers to reduce a country’s current account balance deficit in the short run will depend on how domestic suppliers respond to the opportunity to sell more exports at a lower price. We can measure this response by calculating the price elasticity of supply of domestic producers.
A devaluation might not solve a balance of payments deficit on a country’s current account in goods and services in the short run because domestic supply of goods might be inelastic. This means domestic producers cannot increase output sufficiently to meet the additional demand for exports.
Further analysis of a devaluation on the general price level could be provided. For example, analysis might consider the proportion of imports accounted for by raw materials and how this might affect the cost of goods and services provided in an economy and how an increase in costs might lead to cost push inflation. Links to other costs such as subsequent wage demands might also be examined.

AO3 Evaluation 

In the long run it is necessary to consider both the price elasticity of demand for imports and the price elasticity of demand for exports. The Marshall-Lerner condition states that the sum of the two elasticities must be greater than one to achieve a successful outcome. 
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low. 
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Characteristics of a perfectly competitive labour market should be described.
The role and main aims of a trade union should be outlined, emphasising the importance of their role in wage bargaining.
A diagram should be provided which shows how wages are determined in a perfectly competitive labour market and how this impacts upon the wage and level of employment within each firm.
Analysis should discuss alternative ways in which a trade union might affect wages and employment. References might be made to factors which affect both the supply of and demand for labour.
Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the intervention of a trade union can influence wage and employment levels in a perfectly competitive labour market.

L2 maximum if no accurate diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

In some cases, the introduction of trade unions might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. Although an increase in productivity might also be produced by substituting capital for labour which might lead to an increase in unemployment.
Trade unions might gain higher wages for labour but because this makes capital relatively cheaper, machines might be substituted for labour which will further reduce employment.
The impact of higher wages on employment will also depend upon how easy it is to substitute capital for labour and the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry.
If trade unions manage to bargain for higher wages but the new wage is above the market equilibrium, there will be an excess supply of labour at the new wage leading to higher unemployment. The extent of this impact will be determined by the relative elasticities of supply of and demand for labour
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

Analysis of how market forces can be used to solve the problem of market failure, caused by negative externalities.

AO3 Evaluation

Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximisation and this might lead to these firms focusing upon private costs and ignoring social cost.
The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all market inefficiency because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.
The use of minimum prices would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces. Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction.
This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.
One form of government intervention might be the introduction of indirect taxation. A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of an indirect taxation on the level of output and efficiency.
Analysis would use this to show the impact of an indirect tax on the PC curve.
Further analysis should then identify the links between the indirect tax and the behaviour of firms. This would link the creation of negative externalities to the benefits of removing them and then linking this to addressing this cause of market failure

N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce indirect taxation however it is difficult to determine the extent of the taxation necessary which will address the issue of market failure without causing other problems, for example, an increase in unemployment.
Also, the impact of indirect taxation in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Some large firms might produce and sell products which have an inelastic demand therefore this would be unlikely to have a significant impact on output and efficiency.
The introduction of indirect taxation might be costly and unnecessarily bureaucratic, as well as being difficult to monitor and enforce.
It might be that government intervention based on the use of alternative more direct approaches such as the use of pollution permit might be more effective.
Indirect taxation is regressive and might unfairly penalise lower income groups.
A conclusion should consider alternatives, compare these with the use of indirect taxation and attempt to form some judgement regarding the effectiveness of this type of policy.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

A clear outline of different causes inflation and why inflation might cause problems.
A more detailed explanation of the causes of cost push inflation, supported by an accurately labelled diagram
A description of alternative policies that a government might use to reduce cost push inflation
Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to increase aggregate supply, in the long term, by increasing productivity through direct investment. For example, by increasing expenditure on education/infrastructure. This analysis might also be supported by a relevant diagram
In the short term, a government might focus on attempting to reduce the cost of producing goods and services by introducing widespread subsidies, reducing indirect taxation, removing tariffs on key imports or the use of incomes policies.

L2 maximum if no accurate diagram providedMust refer to some supply side polices to gain L3 marks
AO3 Evaluation

Increasing the use of subsidies and/or decreasing the use of indirect taxation is likely to have a negative effect on a government’s budget. For example, increasing the budget deficit and subsequently increasing the need for more government borrowing.
Removing tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the incomes and output of domestic producers and possibly lead to an increase in unemployment
The introduction of incomes policies is likely to lead to opposition from trade Unions and the possibility of industrial disruption.
Long run supply-side policies are likely to focus on attempts to increase productivity. This frequently involves significant investment in new technology which will lead to a rise in unemployment in the short run
Other policies which might be used in the long run might include immediate investment in skills training and improving the quality of the infrastructure. Skills training is expensive and hence has a high initial opportunity cost. While the immediate effect of an increase in expenditure on improving the infrastructure is likely to increase aggregate demand and add to the inflationary pressure 
A conclusion should attempt to assess the relative effectiveness of each type of policy approach and consider which approach is likely to be the most effective in the short run and then compare this with possible outcomes that might be achieved in the long run.

Accept evaluation relating to demand side policies.

The introduction of a trade union into a perfectly competitive labour market will always lead to higher wage levels and a higher level of unemployment.
With the help of a diagram, evaluate this statement.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Characteristics of a perfectly competitive labour market should be described.
The role and main aims of a trade union should be outlined, emphasising the importance of their role in wage bargaining.
A diagram should be provided which shows how wages are determined in a perfectly competitive labour market and how this impacts upon the wage and level of employment within each firm.
Analysis should discuss alternative ways in which a trade union might affect wages and employment. References might be made to factors which affect both the supply of and demand for labour.
Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the intervention of a trade union can influence wage and employment levels in a perfectly competitive labour market.

L2 maximum if no accurate diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

In some cases, the introduction of trade unions might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. Although an increase in productivity might also be produced by substituting capital for labour which might lead to an increase in unemployment.
Trade unions might gain higher wages for labour but because this makes capital relatively cheaper, machines might be substituted for labour which will further reduce employment.
The impact of higher wages on employment will also depend upon how easy it is to substitute capital for labour and the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry.
If trade unions manage to bargain for higher wages but the new wage is above the market equilibrium, there will be an excess supply of labour at the new wage leading to higher unemployment. The extent of this impact will be determined by the relative elasticities of supply of and demand for labour
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

Use of a diagram to analyse the links between negative externalities and market failure.
Analysis of how market forces can be used to solve the problem of market failure, caused by negative externalities.

AO3 Evaluation

Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximisation and this might lead to these firms focusing upon private costs and ignoring social cost.
The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all market inefficiency because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.
The use of minimum prices would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces. Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction.
This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.
One form of government intervention might be the introduction of indirect taxation. A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of an indirect taxation on the level of output and efficiency.
Analysis would use this to show the impact of an indirect tax on the PC curve.
Further analysis should then identify the links between the indirect tax and the behaviour of firms. This would link the creation of negative externalities to the benefits of removing them and then linking this to addressing this cause of market failure

N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce indirect taxation however it is difficult to determine the extent of the taxation necessary which will address the issue of market failure without causing other problems, for example, an increase in unemployment.
Also, the impact of indirect taxation in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Some large firms might produce and sell products which have an inelastic demand therefore this would be unlikely to have a significant impact on output and efficiency.
The introduction of indirect taxation might be costly and unnecessarily bureaucratic, as well as being difficult to monitor and enforce.
It might be that government intervention based on the use of alternative more direct approaches such as the use of pollution permit might be more effective.
Indirect taxation is regressive and might unfairly penalise lower income groups.
A conclusion should consider alternatives, compare these with the use of indirect taxation and attempt to form some judgement regarding the effectiveness of this type of policy.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting secondary/tertiary goods/services.
High living standards are generally associated with: low poverty levels; advanced infrastructure; good housing, education and health; and low infant mortality rates.
Economic growth is usually measured by changes in real GDP per capita in a specific time period.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita.
Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth. 
Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a high-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in economic growth and an increase in living standards are not clear. Economic growth is a quantitative measure not a qualitative measure
Economic growth which depends upon globalisation would increase long distance transport which would create more negative externalities.
It is not clear how any benefits of economic growth might be used in a high-income economy
Globalisation might lead to an increase in cheap imports from low-income economies which might lead to higher levels of unemployment in more advanced economies.
A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term benefits of globalisation in relation to the improvement of living standards in high-income countries. Also a judgement should consider whether this will automatically improve living standards.

Aid can be defined as any assistance given to a country that would not be provided through normal market forces.
There are two main types of aid, humanitarian aid; development aid. Development aid would include many different types including: long term loans; tied aid; bilateral aid and multilateral aid.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population grow.
Aid that focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
Aid can increase real wealth and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in aid and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes aid only reaches a relatively small section of the population. For example, due to corruption.
Different types of aid might produce different outcomes. For example, aid in the form of long-term loans might make it more difficult for low-income countries to escape the cycle of poverty.
Aid is sometimes given for political reasons rather than the low-income countries where the need is the greatest.
Tied aid might mean that low--income countries receiving such aid have to purchase goods and services from the donor country which are more expensive.
Long term dependency upon aid might lead to a welfare mentality and reduce levels of innovation in the low-income country.
A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term efficacy of development aid in relation to the improvement of living standards in low-income countries.

Consider the relative merits of gross national income (GNI) and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as measures of the standard of living.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and TableB: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 14 marks. AO3 out of 6 marks.
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition of GNI: the total income earned within a country in a year plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production. This is an aggregate measure of an economy’s income.
GNI measures in monetary terms.
For many developing countries which rely on remittances from overseas workers, this will boost the value of GNI.
Other countries that have invested overseas will receive a stream of dividends and interest that boosts their GNI.
Definition of the MPI
Some explicit breakdown of the categories which are involved in the construction of MPI
Health: 1/3rd weighting includes child mortality and nutrition (1/6th each);
Education: 1/3rd weighting includes years of schooling and school attendance (1/6th each); and
Standard of living 1/3 weighting includes cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing and assets (1/18th each).
The measures are fundamentally different in their approaches GNI is concerned with money values whilst MPI is concerned with the adequacy of provision of a number of essential services and goods linked to the Millennium Development Goals.

AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation may be by individual measure or by comparing the measures.

GNI The comprehensiveness of the data collection: 
The GNI figures needs deflating for the effects of price increases and changes in the population to achieve real GNI per head, which allows for comparisons over time.
The range of incomes which are included ‘the dark economy’, illegal activity – drugs crime etc. the ability to count all income flows between countries. 
Incomes from activities that produce negative externalities or are the result of monopoly profits increase the GNI but reduce the level of economic efficiency.
Real GNI per head can be used as a simple measure of economic growth but lacks a distributional measure. Additional measures such as the Gini coefficient need to be calculated to gain a measure of the distributional effect of a given GNI. Both these measures are averages which disguise a wide range of individual circumstances.
The data collection for MPI is more complex than for GNI. The criteria for GNI are well established and are given.
Monetary-based poverty measures can omit a lot. The overlap between monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty is not perfect. In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.
Economic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation. Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.
Real GNI per head data is available for 188 (most) countries of the world whilst MPI data is only available for 103 poorer countries. 
MPI for education measures inputs not outputs, attending school is not the same as learning to read

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome thatachieves allocative efficiency. 
Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of taxation; the use of negative advertising, direct regulation
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a negative externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not recognize the existence of a negative externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of flight use when the negative externality is taken into account.
One type of intervention might involve the use of taxation by a government. A tax will increase the cost of air travel which will decrease demand. A decrease in demand will decrease the equilibrium number of flights and achieve allocative efficiency.
A government might use negative advertising to decrease demand. A decrease in demand will lead to fewer flight, volume of air travel will fall and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a tax however it is difficult to measure the precise level of taxation required.
Also, the impact of a tax on price and demand in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly, and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of consumption is reached 
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities, but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

AO3 Evaluation

The effectiveness of monetary policy is likely to depend to some extent upon the cause of unemployment. Monetary policy can be used to influence aggregate monetary demand which will be more effective dealing with cyclical unemployment.
The use of some monetary instruments might have a negative effect on macroeconomic aims. For example, reducing interest rates might depreciate the currency and potentially promote either cost push or demand-pull inflation.
Alternative policies might be more effective if structural factors are responsible for unemployment. In this case, supply-side policies might be more effective.
Lowering interest rates might cause problems for specific industries within an economy. For example, low interest rates might cause a boom in the housing market.
A conclusion should make an attempt to make an overall comparison between the use of monetary policy and alternative fiscal or supply side policies. A judgement should be made which directly addresses the statement in question.

A developed analysis of the links between each of the data given and the SoL.

AO3 Evaluation

Data does not specify precise time periods, therefore it’s not possible to tell whether the position has improved or not with respect of GNI or the other data given.
Can point out that population size rather than population change would be a better measure together with a base year price index to allow real GNI per capita to be calculated to indicate the material SoL.
Wages and disposable income and the unemployment rate would indicate the change in the material SoL.
The changes in wages in comparison with inflation suggests there is a fall in real income.
The need for other measures: education, health, life expectancy, hours worked etc. which influence the non-material SoL e.g., HDI, MEW or MPI.

An analysis of the relationship between the MES and the market demand determining the number of firms many/a few/one equivalent to perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly or monopoly. 
Examples MES and market demand. MES = 50% therefore in theory 2 firms – a duopoly MES 2% therefore 50 firms perfect/monopolistic competition. 
Relevant diagram for economies of scale with indication of MES and demand curve. 

AO3 Evaluation

MES is not static and may change over time eg technological change. 
The definition of the market will affect the calculation of the relationship. The village shop which operates at a small scale is appropriate for the village market. 
Markets will still exist where particular firms produce small scale highcost items e.g. luxury cars or designer clothes to satisfy a niche portion of a bigger market.

Consider the relative merits of gross national income (GNI) and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as measures of the standard of living.
Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis and TableB: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.
AO1 and AO2 out of 14 marks. AO3 out of 6 marks.
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition of GNI: the total income earned within a country in a year plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production. This is an aggregate measure of an economy’s income.
GNI measures in monetary terms.
For many developing countries which rely on remittances from overseas workers, this will boost the value of GNI.
Other countries that have invested overseas will receive a stream of dividends and interest that boosts their GNI.
Definition of the MPI
Some explicit breakdown of the categories which are involved in the construction of MPI
Health: 1/3rd weighting includes child mortality and nutrition (1/6th each);
Education: 1/3rd weighting includes years of schooling and school attendance (1/6th each); and
Standard of living 1/3 weighting includes cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing and assets (1/18th each).
The measures are fundamentally different in their approaches GNI is concerned with money values whilst MPI is concerned with the adequacy of provision of a number of essential services and goods linked to the Millennium Development Goals.

AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation may be by individual measure or by comparing the measures.

GNI The comprehensiveness of the data collection: 
The GNI figures needs deflating for the effects of price increases and changes in the population to achieve real GNI per head, which allows for comparisons over time.
The range of incomes which are included ‘the dark economy’, illegal activity – drugs crime etc. the ability to count all income flows between countries. 
Incomes from activities that produce negative externalities or are the result of monopoly profits increase the GNI but reduce the level of economic efficiency.
Real GNI per head can be used as a simple measure of economic growth but lacks a distributional measure. Additional measures such as the Gini coefficient need to be calculated to gain a measure of the distributional effect of a given GNI. Both these measures are averages which disguise a wide range of individual circumstances.
The data collection for MPI is more complex than for GNI. The criteria for GNI are well established and are given.
Monetary-based poverty measures can omit a lot. The overlap between monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty is not perfect. In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.
Economic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation. Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.
Real GNI per head data is available for 188 (most) countries of the world whilst MPI data is only available for 103 poorer countries. 
MPI for education measures inputs not outputs, attending school is not the same as learning to read

Characteristics of a monopolistically competitive market should be described.
Difference between short run and long run profit maximizing output in monopolistically competitive markets.
A monopoly market should be described, including main characteristics and key difference between this type of market and monopolistic competition i.e. barriers to entry.
Different types of efficiency should be identified and explained.
Analysis should discuss the links between monopoly and higher prices and inefficiency. This analysis can then be used to compare both monopoly and monopolistically competitive markets.
Analysis should then be used to compare short run and long run outcomes on both types of market. 

AO3 Evaluation

Some monopolies might invest in new technology and achieve dynamic efficiency. This will enable lower average total costs and an opportunity to pass the benefits of lower costs on in the form of lower prices.
Similarly, monopolies might benefit from economies of scale which might also lead to lower prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms might incur additional costs through the need to engage in non-price competition. This might lead to higher prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms will achieve productive efficiency in the long run but a profit maximizing firm will not operate at an allocatively efficient level of output.
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement by addressing both price levels and efficiency outcomes in relation to both types of market structure. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

A perfect labour market would assume homogenous labour, perfect mobility, identical jobs, many buyers and sellers of labour and perfect information. This would mean that each firm’s supply of labour would be perfectly elastic and a wage taker.
In perfect labour markets the wage that has to be taken by each firm will be determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the industry.
Imperfect labour markets might occur due to the intervention of trade unions or government. A monopsony, single buyer of labour would also lead to market failure. 
Market failure associated with imperfect markets will often result in lower wages and/or higher levels of unemployment.
Intervention by trade unions by controlling the supply of labour might lead to higher wages but this is likely to cause higher levels of unemployment. A diagram that illustrates supply of and demand for labour showing a decrease in supply will illustrate this potential outcome.
A government might impose a minimum wage above the market equilibrium wage which would also result in higher wages but would be accompanied by higher levels of unemployment. This analysis would be supported by an accurate, clearly labelled diagram plus an explanation. 
A monopsony firm would employ labour where the marginal cost of labour was equal to the marginal revenue product of labour. This would potentially lead to both lower wages and higher levels of unemployment. An accurately labelled diagram plus an explanation would support this conclusion.

AO3 Evaluation

In some circumstance it is possible for trade unions to increase labour productivity through increased training. This would increase the demand for labour by increasing the marginal productivity of labour which would enable both higher wages and higher levels of employment to be attained. This can be illustrated by a supporting diagram and further explanation.
The negative impact of imposing a minimum wage on the level of employment will depend upon the relative elasticities of the demand for and supply of labour. If the demand and supply are relatively inelastic then it would be possible to introduce a relatively high minimum wage which will not have a significant impact on the level of employment.
It is possible for trade unions to intervene in monopsonistic markets and undertake bilateral wage negotiations. Depending on the respective bargaining strengths of the union and monopsony, it might be possible for collective bargaining to raise both wages and employment. A supporting diagram plus an explanation would illustrate this potential outcome. 
In some circumstances a government might need to intervene to maintain the provision of vital public services as a priority, if trade unions attempt to increase wages through the withdrawal of labour. 
In conclusion it is possible to show that imperfect labour markets do not always lead to lower wages and a higher level of unemployment. Trade unions, through the power of collective bargaining, can counteract the negative effects of monopsony labour markets. Also trade unions can train labour to increase labour productivity to enable an increase in wages at the same time that employment levels are rising.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Positive externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a benefit to society which is greater than that received by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimes described as a positive ‘spill-over’ effect.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-production/consumption of a good or service.
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies; the use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services.
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a positive externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the positive externality is taken into account.
Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised.
One type of intervention might involve the use of subsidies provided by a government. A subsidy will lower the cost of production which will increase supply. An increase in supply will lower price, increase the equilibrium output and achieve allocative efficiency.
A government might use advertising to increase demand. An increase in demand will lead to a higher consumption, output will rise and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.
Alternatively, a government might directly provide the good or service which can increase production and supply and eventually attain an allocatively efficient outcome.

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached.
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

        Question: Explain the theory of how a consumer decides to achieve the situation described as 'equilibrium' when purchasing two different products. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Explain the theory of how a consumer decides to achieve the situation described as 'equilibrium' when purchasing two different products. [12],"a
Explain the theory of how a consumer decides to achieve the situation described as 'equilibrium' when purchasing two different products. Marginal utility is significant in relating the utility/satisfaction to the price in determining equilibrium quantity bought. Candidates can use either MU theory or marginal changes on indifference curves related to budget lines. If MU is used, they must relate it to two products. L4 (9–12 marks): for a clear explanation and a sound comment on the relation between the price and the satisfaction obtained, referring to more than one good. L3 (7–8 marks): for a less developed answer but which still refers to the equilibrium but probably concentrates on only one good with MU or is unclear about the relevance of the tangency with indifference curves. L2 (5–6 marks): for a brief attempt which does not clearly bring out the significance of the marginal analysis. L1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12],"a

Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide.
Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.
Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.
In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear, explanation of what economists mean by a public good and its relationship to market failure. The key elements of cost benefit analysis should then be set out. The link between the nature of public goods and the use of cost benefit analysis should be established and a discussion of the effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in this situation should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an explanation of what is meant by public goods. Cost benefit analysis will be explained but not fully developed. There will be a limited attempt to link the provision of public goods to cost benefit analysis. The effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in these circumstances will not be considered.
L2 (5-6 marks): For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of public goods and some of the key aspects of cost benefit analysis. There will only be a very limited attempt to link a government’s decision to provide a public good and the use of cost benefit analysis. No evaluation of the effectiveness of cost benefit will be provided.
L1 (1-4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [12],"a

Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.
Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a clear, explanation of monopoly profit maximisation pricing and an analysis of why limit pricing could be used and the extent to which its use would support the statement in question. Evaluative comment should also be provided to question how far the statement in question can be supported. L3 (7–8 marks) For a clear analysis of how a profit maximising monopolist would choose its output and how limit pricing works and the extent to which its use supports the statement in question. No evaluative comment will be provided to question the extent to which the statement in question is correct. L2 (5–6 marks) For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of the profit maximising pricing strategy of a monopoly and also how limit pricing might work. However, the distinction between the short run and long run impact of limit pricing will not discussed and no analysis further analysis of the statement in question will be provided. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.'  Discuss this view. [12],"a

'Economic growth should be the most important macroeconomic aim.' Discuss this view.
A clear definition of the term economic growth is required. Each of the four key macroeconomic goals should be clearly stated and their importance recognized. The main body of the response should focus upon whether economic growth should be considered the most important, along with supporting evidence. This evidence will examine the costs/benefits of achieving this goal in comparison to the costs/benefits of achieving alternative goals.
Good responses will recognize that all four goals are linked and achieving/not achieving one goal might have a significantly impact on the potential to achieve other goals. A conclusion should be provided which considers the extent to which the statement is correct.
L4 (9–12 marks): For demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept of economic growth and an awareness of other key macroeconomic goals.The question requires an assessment of the importance of this particular macroeconomic goal with reference to two alternative goals. An awareness of the difficulties involved in isolating alternative macroeconomic goals might also be demonstrated.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a clear definition of the economic growth and the identification of other important macroeconomic goals. Analysis will be provided but it will be less detailed and the links between the key macroeconomic goals will not be fully recognised. A final comment on the validity of the view under consideration might not be provided.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a competent comment with the emphasis on describing alternative macroeconomic goals. Some limited explanation will be provided but there will be no attempt to examine the links between these goals. There will be no attempt to discuss the validity of the view.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [12],"a

Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.
Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a clear, explanation of monopoly profit maximisation pricing and an analysis of why limit pricing could be used and the extent to which its use would support the statement in question. Evaluative comment should also be provided to question how far the statement in question can be supported. L3 (7–8 marks) For a clear analysis of how a profit maximising monopolist would choose its output and how limit pricing works and the extent to which its use supports the statement in question. No evaluative comment will be provided to question the extent to which the statement in question is correct. L2 (5–6 marks) For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of the profit maximising pricing strategy of a monopoly and also how limit pricing might work. However, the distinction between the short run and long run impact of limit pricing will not discussed and no analysis further analysis of the statement in question will be provided. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow this structure:
        - The question will either be purely explanatory (it will ask you to ""Explain"" an economic statement in detail) or evaluative (it will ask you to ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" a statement, i.e. give a balanced overview of why the statement may be true, why it may not be true, and an evaluation of whether it is true)
        - If the question is purely explanatory (no ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" or ""agree or disagree"" or ""evaluate""), then:
            - You will be asked to explain an economic statement. Think of all the points you will need to explain first to properly explain that statement.
            - For example, ""The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained.""
            - Your task is to elaborate on each of these sub-points using as much economic detail as possible. 
            - For each of these points, you will need to:
                - Define and explain the keywords in the point, e.g. ""Collusion refers to agreements between firms to fix prices, usually above the market equilibrium in an oligopoly market. This can be in the form of tacit collusion, which does not involve formal agreements, or in the form of a formal agreement and the formation of a cartel.""
                - Explain the point with a cause-and-effect chain if applicable (""Firms may choose to collude because of the Prisoner's Dilemma innate in an oligopoly. If a firm sets its price high, all other firms will set their prices low and the firm setting high prices will lose out on all its consumers; this results in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium and firms can counteract this by agreeing to set prices high together."")
        - If the question countains an evaluation part (""And consider whether..."", ""Discuss..."", ""Evaluate..."", mark scheme mentioning an ""evaluation""):
             - Follow all of the above for the explanation part.
             - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
             - Points may include: the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
             - You will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
             - This should be at the very end of your essay.
             - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
             - Offer a conclusion combining all the evauation points.

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your explanation paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation, if the question asks for it. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             
        - Your response will be approximately 700 words.

        Question: Compare and contrast the derivation of a consumer's demand curve using Marshall's marginal utility analysis with a consumer's demand curve derived by indifference curves. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Compare and contrast the derivation of a consumer's demand curve using Marshall's marginal utility analysis with a consumer's demand curve derived by indifference curves. [12],"a
Marshall’s utility requires a precise calculation of marginal utility, and by relating MU to price, has a direct link to the construction of a demand curve. Indifference curve theory shows different quantities of two goods bought as either income or price changes; changes in amounts bought can be split into income and substitution effects and different types of goods more readily distinguished than with Marshall’s theory. However there is no direct link to a complete demand curve which shows demand against price. The analysis does not require an absolute ‘cardinal’ measurement of utility in ‘utils’ but it still requires a measurement satisfaction which in reality is unrealistic.L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound explanation of the analysis and a clear understanding of the principles involved with an accurate comment on the differences between the two approaches in the link to demand curves. L3 (7–8 marks) for an accurate reference to the question but with a more limited evaluation or with minor errors in the analysis. L2 (5–6 marks) for a briefer explanation of the analysis and a more one-sided comment on the differences. L1 (1–4 marks) for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Consider whether in oligopoly the theory proposes that the market price is rigid. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Consider whether in oligopoly the theory proposes that the market price is rigid. [12],"a
Explanation of the theory of oligopoly. Uncertainty arises because of lack of knowledge of future behaviour of rivals, unclear knowledge about demand curve, existence of non-price competition, conflict over whether to co-operate with rivals or compete. All of this causes rigidity. Theory concentrates on the idea of a fixed, or more rigid price but this does not really explain how the price is fixed in the first place. L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound explanation of the analysis and a clear understanding of the principles involved with a full account of possible reasons for rigid price. L3 (7–8 marks) for an accurate reference to the question but with a more limited evaluation or with minor errors in the analysis. L2 (5–6 marks) for a briefer explanation of the analysis, with possible a shorter account of the kinked demand curve theory but no evaluation. L1 (1–4 marks) for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory

        Question: Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12],"a

Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide.
Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.
Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.
In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear, explanation of what economists mean by a public good and its relationship to market failure. The key elements of cost benefit analysis should then be set out. The link between the nature of public goods and the use of cost benefit analysis should be established and a discussion of the effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in this situation should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an explanation of what is meant by public goods. Cost benefit analysis will be explained but not fully developed. There will be a limited attempt to link the provision of public goods to cost benefit analysis. The effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in these circumstances will not be considered.
L2 (5-6 marks): For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of public goods and some of the key aspects of cost benefit analysis. There will only be a very limited attempt to link a government’s decision to provide a public good and the use of cost benefit analysis. No evaluation of the effectiveness of cost benefit will be provided.
L1 (1-4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: High market concentration ratios are closely linked to oligopoly market structures.Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",High market concentration ratios are closely linked to oligopoly market structures.Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm. [12],"a

High market concentration ratios are closely linked to Oligopoly market structures.Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm.
Some industries are dominated by a few large firms. A concentration ratio indicates the extent to which large firms might dominate an industry. For example, 4 large firms might control more than 80% of a market while a large number of small firms account for the remaining 20% of the market. In this case the four firm concentration ratio would be 80%.
Oligopolies are market structures which can be specifically identified by noting that there are only a few large firms which dominate the market i.e. they have high market concentration ratios and they also have high barriers to entry which maintains their dominant position. However, because of the nature of this type of market structure, firms have to take into account the reaction of their main rivals before adopting their pricing strategy i.e. they are interdependent. If a firm chooses to ignore the reactions of its main rivals, this could result in a price war where each firm loses potential revenue and consumers gain. As a result Oligopolies will often adopt alternative strategies to maintain/increase market share and maximise profits. Sometimes firms will collude and agree to fix a price. This is illegal but it is still used.
Alternatively, the dominant firm within the group might become the price leader and set the market price which other large firms choose to follow. Game theory and the theory of the kinked demand curve can be used to assess which strategy might be the most effective. Most of these alternative pricing strategies will lead to price rigidity. It should be noted that many Oligopoly firms will adopt non price competition such as advertising or increasing product differentiation to avoid the negative impact of price competition.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear explanation of what is meant by a high market concentration ratio and an attempt to link this to an Oligopoly market structure. Analysis of alternative pricing policies which might subsequently be adopted will be provided and an assessment of their likely impact on a firm's profits/market share. Some reference to alternative non pricing market strategies might form part of a conclusion.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an accurate reference to the question and clear understanding of the term high market concentration ratio and its link to an Oligopoly market structure. One link to a pricing policy should be analysed in detail, other strategies might be referred to but not fully developed.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a briefer descriptive comment that explains the terms in the question and provides some evidence of the main characteristics of an Oligopoly. Reference to pricing policies might be made but not clearly linked to the nature of the market structure.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

[12],"a
Explanation of wage rates in a perfectly competitive industry linking the firm and the industry and relating the MRP to the supply/cost of labour. The absence of a wage rate implies that it can be negotiated and this would mean the industry is likely to be imperfectly competitive. Firms in perfectly competitive labour markets have to accept the wage rate determined by the industry. Explanation of wage rates in a perfectly competitive industry linking the firm and the industry. Either demand and supply approach or MRP theory but L4 for MRP. Some attempt at the second part of the question is necessary. L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound explanation of theory and a clear understanding of the principles involved linking the market and the firm. Higher marks for showing effect of a shift in the MRP. It is necessary to deal with the second part of the question for L4. L3 (7–8 marks) for a competent comment but with limited elaboration. Still a link between the firm and industry but no shifts in demand or supply and illexplained comment on the second part of the question. L2 (5–6 marks) for a briefer explanation probably not fully explaining the equilibrium and no link between firm and industry or no comment on the second part of the question. L1 (1–4 marks) for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory

        Question: Using diagrams, explain with examples the meaning of a positive externality for a consumer and a negative externality for a producer. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ","Using diagrams, explain with examples the meaning of a positive externality for a consumer and a negative externality for a producer. [12]","a

Using diagrams, explain with examples the meaning of a positive externality for a consumer and a negative externality for a producer.
Externalities are spillover costs or benefits which do not apply to the originator of the actions. Positive externalities for a consumer bring a benefit and social marginal benefit is greater than private marginal benefits. Negative externalities for a producer bring a cost not paid for by the producer, Marginal social costs are greater than marginal private costs. Examples.
L4 (9–12 marks) For an answer which defines positive and negative externalities and analyses their relationship to social/private costs and social/private benefits. Appropriate diagrams are shown with reference to them in the text. Examples are linked to both types of externality. L3 (7–8 marks) For an answer which defines positive or negative externalities and analyses their relationship to social/private costs or social/private benefits. Appropriate diagrams are shown with some limited reference to them in the text. Examples are provided. L2 (5–6 marks) For an answer which explains positive and negative externalities an example of either positive or negative externality is given. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer which has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies. Errors of theory or omissions of analysis will be substantial.

        Question: Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. [12],"a

Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide.
Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.
Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.
In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear, explanation of what economists mean by a public good and its relationship to market failure. The key elements of cost benefit analysis should then be set out. The link between the nature of public goods and the use of cost benefit analysis should be established and a discussion of the effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in this situation should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an explanation of what is meant by public goods. Cost benefit analysis will be explained but not fully developed. There will be a limited attempt to link the provision of public goods to cost benefit analysis. The effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in these circumstances will not be considered.
L2 (5-6 marks): For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of public goods and some of the key aspects of cost benefit analysis. There will only be a very limited attempt to link a government’s decision to provide a public good and the use of cost benefit analysis. No evaluation of the effectiveness of cost benefit will be provided.
L1 (1-4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.
Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a clear, explanation of monopoly profit maximisation pricing and an analysis of why limit pricing could be used and the extent to which its use would support the statement in question. Evaluative comment should also be provided to question how far the statement in question can be supported. L3 (7–8 marks) For a clear analysis of how a profit maximising monopolist would choose its output and how limit pricing works and the extent to which its use supports the statement in question. No evaluative comment will be provided to question the extent to which the statement in question is correct. L2 (5–6 marks) For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of the profit maximising pricing strategy of a monopoly and also how limit pricing might work. However, the distinction between the short run and long run impact of limit pricing will not discussed and no analysis further analysis of the statement in question will be provided. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        ",Explain the role of liquidity preference in the determination of interest rates and assess its importance. [12],"a
Explain the role of liquidity preference in the determination of interest rates and assess its importance. Liquidity preference should be explained as that part of an individual’s assets which are held in cash rather than government securities or other assets. Key determinants such as the level of income and interest rates should be referred to. Answers should recognise that liquidity preference determines the demand for money and that it is the interaction of the market forces of supply of and demand for money which will determine interest rates.L4 (9–12 marks): for an answer that questions some of the assumptions which underlie liquidity preference theory. Also, some attempt might be made to discuss alternative approaches to interest rate determination which question the role of liquidity preference as a key determinant. L3 (7–8 marks): for an answer that demonstrates an understanding that liquidity preference represents the demand for money and when this is combined with the supply of money, we can show how market forces determine interest rates. A supporting diagram might be provided. L2 (5–6 marks): for an answer that is limited to explaining what is meant by liquidity preference and which describes some factors which might influence liquidity preference L1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: A profit maximising firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market might decide to increase the number of workers it employs but it will not choose to increase its workers' wage rates.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",A profit maximising firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market might decide to increase the number of workers it employs but it will not choose to increase its workers' wage rates.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [12],"a

A profit maximising firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market might decide to increase the number of workers it employs but it will not choose to increase its workers' wage rates.
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.
Key assumptions which underpin the theory of a perfectly competitive labour market should include: homogeneous labour; perfect mobility of labour, no barriers to entry, firms are wage takers; perfect knowledge. A profit maximising firm operating in this market will employ labour up to the point where the marginal product of labour is equal to the wage paid to labour. An explanation of the link between MRP and the demand for labour should be provided. It should also be noted that the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at a wage determined by the market forces of supply of and demand for labour. If the productivity of workers within the firm increases or the price received by this firm increase, then the demand for labour will rise and more workers will be employed.
However, the wage rate will not change. If a firm in perfect competition allowed an increase in its worker's wages it would no longer maximise profits at the new level of output. Therefore this would support the statement in the question. Similarly, if a firm in a perfectly competitive labour market decided to raise wages with an increase in MRP, profits would only be maximised if the level of employment fell. It should be recognised in a conclusion that both wages and employment could rise at the same time if any of the conditions which determine market demand or market supply change. In this case each firm will receive a perfectly elastic supply of labour at a higher wage rate.
L4 (9–12 marks) for a sound discussion that explains what is meant by a perfectly competitive labour market and how the profit maximising level of employment will be determined based on the supply of and demand for labour by the firm. Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the statement in the question might be true. A conclusion should refer to and consider the relationship between the labour market and the supply of labour to each firm.
L3 (7–8 marks) for a competent comment with limited analysis that recognises what constitutes a perfect labour market and the profit maximising level of employment in this market. Some attempt might be made to address the specific question but the analysis will not be fully developed. No conclusion will be provided.
L2 (5–6 marks) for an attempt which describes a perfectly competitive labour market and makes a limited attempt to explain how a firm in such a market might maximise profits but does not discuss why the demand for labour might change or why employment might rise but wages will not.
L1 (1–4 marks) for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow this structure:
        - The question will either be purely explanatory (it will ask you to ""Explain"" an economic statement in detail) or evaluative (it will ask you to ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" a statement, i.e. give a balanced overview of why the statement may be true, why it may not be true, and an evaluation of whether it is true)
        - If the question is purely explanatory (no ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" or ""agree or disagree"" or ""evaluate""), then:
            - You will be asked to explain an economic statement. Think of all the points you will need to explain first to properly explain that statement.
            - For example, ""The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained.""
            - Your task is to elaborate on each of these sub-points using as much economic detail as possible. 
            - For each of these points, you will need to:
                - Define and explain the keywords in the point, e.g. ""Collusion refers to agreements between firms to fix prices, usually above the market equilibrium in an oligopoly market. This can be in the form of tacit collusion, which does not involve formal agreements, or in the form of a formal agreement and the formation of a cartel.""
                - Explain the point with a cause-and-effect chain if applicable (""Firms may choose to collude because of the Prisoner's Dilemma innate in an oligopoly. If a firm sets its price high, all other firms will set their prices low and the firm setting high prices will lose out on all its consumers; this results in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium and firms can counteract this by agreeing to set prices high together."")
        - If the question countains an evaluation part (""And consider whether..."", ""Discuss..."", ""Evaluate..."", mark scheme mentioning an ""evaluation""):
             - Follow all of the above for the explanation part.
             - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
             - Points may include: the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
             - You will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
             - This should be at the very end of your essay.
             - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
             - Offer a conclusion combining all the evauation points.

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your explanation paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation, if the question asks for it. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             
        - Your response will be approximately 700 words.


        Question: Use marginal utility analysis to explain the derivation of the individual demand curve for a good. [12]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 12 marks
        ",Use marginal utility analysis to explain the derivation of the individual demand curve for a good. [12],"a
Use marginal utility analysis to explain the derivation of the individual demand curve for goodMarginal utility analysis:Explanation of total utility(TU) and marginal utility (MU) and falling MU. Link to ratio of MUx to Px. Principle of equi-marginal equality explained. MUx/Px = MUy/Py Development of the effect of a change in Px on MUx and thus demand by an individual. Conversion to an individual's demand curve and then a market demand curve. L4 (9–12 marks): For an answer that gives a sound explanation of the change in equilibrium when the price of one good changes in relation to the price of another good. The equi-marginal principle is used to analyse this effect. Extension of individual demand to market demand curve. Max 9 For individual demand curve with no reference to the market. L3 (7–8 marks): For an answer that develops the analysis to the equimarginal principle in relation to two goods and then attempts to determine an individual demand curve. L2 (5–6 marks): For an answer that explains total and marginal utility and its link to the purchase of one good. L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies. Errors of theory or omissions of analysis will be substantial.

An economy moves from a deficit to a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments
Explain what is meant by a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments and consider the possible impact on the level of employment and prices when there is a change from a deficit to a surplus current account balance in an economy.
For knowledge and understanding of what the current account of the balance of payments measures (1 mark) and what is meant by a surplus (1 mark)
For application that explains the impact of the emerging surplus upon employment. (Up to 3 marks)
For application that explains the impact of the emerging surplus upon domestic prices. (Up to 3 marks)

8

The current account should be defined as trade in goods, services plus other income.
For the second mark, a surplus is where payments received by a country exceed payments made by a country / where income from exports exceeds expenditure on imports.
The cause of the surplus will clearly be an increase in exports and / or a decrease in imports. However, there are several reasons why this might occur e.g., increased popularity of Russian exports, government policy to dampen domestic demand etc. Give 1 mark for identifying a valid cause / reason and then up to 2 marks for a developed explanation of the impact on employment and use the same criteria to award marks for the impact on domestic prices.

                            You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 8-mark A-Level structured question.  Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
            
            Formatting & Structure
            1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
            2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
            3. Your essay should follow the following two-part structure:

                Part 1: Analysis. Roughly 300 words. (Worth 6 marks.)

                - The question will ask you to explain a concept in A-Level economics. Usually, this will be a cause-and-effect statement (""explain how a decrease in interest rates could cause economic growth"") or something that requires you to identify two or three different factors (""Explain three causes of unemployment"").
                - Your analysis paragraph will be in two parts:
                    - Knowledge and understanding, worth 3 marks. Define the key terms in the question and explain what they mean, e.g. ""unemployment is the state of being willing and able to work but not having a paid job.""
                    - Analysis, worth 3 marks. Explain the statement in the question, e.g. ""One cause of employment is frictional unemployment, which is ...""
    
                Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 80 words. (Worth 2 marks.)
                
                - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
                - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
                - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end.
                        
            Diagrams
            - If your answer needs to reference a diagram, please:
                - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
                - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
                - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

            Non-Negotiable
            - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
            - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.  
            - DO NOT generate any subsection titles, like ""Evaluation:"" or ""Analysis:"".
            - Your analysis paragraph should be much longer than your evaluation. Expand on the analysis points more than on evaluation.

With the help of a diagram(s), explain what is meant by equilibrium in a market, and consider the extent to which the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity are likely to change for a product following an increase in the wages for labour across the whole economy.
Follow the point-based marking guidance at the top of this mark scheme and award:up to 3 marks for AO1 Knowledge and understanding up to 3 marks for AO2 Analysisup to 2 marks for AO3 Evaluation.
AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)The equilibrium point is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied (1) and there is no tendency to change in a market (1) with an accurately labelled diagram showing the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity (1)
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Note: there are two possible approaches to answering this question. If both the approach focused on demand-side (inferior and normal goods) and the supply-side approach are attempted, then only the best response should be marked including marks for evaluation.
EITHER: The demand curve will be expected to shift in this situation. Whether it shifts to the left or to the right will depend on the nature of the product and will shift to the left if it is an inferior good or to the right if it is a normal good. This should be the basis of the discussion.
For an accurately labelled diagram demonstrating at least one of the appropriate shift(s) in the demand curve i.e., to the right and / or the left (1) that clearly shows the change in the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity for both a normal and inferior good (1) and is accompanied by a clear explanation of both shifts (1)
If only one shift (normal or inferior goods) is explained, then a maximum of 2 marks.
Note: it is acceptable to use the same diagram for both knowledge and understanding and analysis
OR:The supply curve will be expected to shift to the left in this situation.
For a fully accurately labelled diagram that is clearly micro based and focused on the impact on a single product (1) that is used to clearly explain the resulting change in the price depending on whether demand is price elastic or price inelastic) (1) and quantity supplied (depending on whether supply is price elastic or price inelastic/use of buffer stocks/ effect of improved productivity) (1)
AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)
EITHER:
The extent of the change will be determined by whether the good is a normal good or an inferior good / the value of ped / the value of YED / the value of PES / the size of the actual change in income. A discussion focused on the extent of change (1) followed by a justified conclusion (1)
OR:
The extent of the change will depend on the importance of wage costs to an individual firm / the significance of PES (1) A discussion focused on the extent of change followed by a justified conclusion (1)

        Question: Using the concept of price elasticity of demand, explain why increasing the price of the product is:

a bad idea for a firm producing a product that constitutes a large proportion of household income, and
a good idea for a firm producing a product that constitutes a small proportion of household income.  [8]

        Question Type: Structured, AS-Level, 8 marks

a good idea for a firm producing a product that constitutes a small proportion of household income.  [8]","a
Using the concept of price elasticity of demand, explain why increasing the price of the product is: (i) a bad idea for a firm producing a product that constitutes a large proportion of household income, and (ii) a good idea for a firm producing a product that constitutes a small proportion of household income. For knowledge and understanding, meaning of PED (1) plus an accurate formula (1) (up to 2 marks) And application: For explanation of the effects on revenue where PED is elastic (i). For a product that constitutes a large proportion of household income this means that the PED will most likely be elastic (1) which means (1) so revenue is likely to fall (1) (up to 3 marks) For explanation of the effects on revenue where PED is inelastic (ii). For a product that constitutes a small proportion of household income this means that the PED is likely to be inelastic (1) which means (1) so revenue is likely to rise (1) (up to 3 marks)
8
Where PED is elastic, an increase in price will lead to less revenue A firm with an inelastic PED will experience an increase in its revenue if it increases the price of its product Note: simple explanations of the impact of elasticity should not be credited, e.g. an increase in price leads to a large fall in demand/no change in demand. The answer must refer to % or proportional changes

A decrease in the price of a product will increase the consumer surplus as more consumers are willing to pay the lower price. The extent of this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for a product. In the case of a luxury product with many substitutes, PED will be elastic. In the case of an essential product with few substitutes, PED will be inelastic.

In 2018 the UK government, concerned about the rise in obesity, particularly amongst young people, imposed a tax on producers of sugar-sweetened drinks. State what is meant by a demerit good, and with the help of a diagram(s) explain how a tax on producers can improve the allocation of resources in the market for sugar-sweetened drinks.For knowledge and understanding of a demerit good which explains that the term refers to a good that has the cost of consumption underestimated/worse for the consumer than they realise/because of information failure (1 mark) and is overconsumed (1 mark) Application that uses a correctly labelled diagram to explain the impact of an indirect tax on price and quantity. Diagram showing a left shift in the S curve (1 mark) the fall in quantity consumed (1 mark) and the increase in price (1 mark) (up to 3 marks)An explanation that the tax is increasing the cost of production for producers (1 mark), which increases the price and reduces the consumption (1 mark) which removes the market failure/problem of information failure/improves the allocation of resources (1 mark) (up to 3 marks)

AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks)The term of trade is a numerical measure of the relationship/ratio between export and import prices (1)with an accurate formula showing the measure as an index (1)whereas the balance of trade in goods measures the revenue earned from exports of goods minus the expenditure on imports of goods (1)
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)Analysis must consider issues concerning both the terms of trade and the balance of trade in goods. These may include:

Up to 2 marks for an analysis of the effects of changes to the terms of trade e.g., relative change in competitiveness, increase in cost-push inflation, effects on balance of trade in goods and services.
Up to 2 marks for an analysis of the effects of changes to the balance of trade e.g., an increase in the demand for exports ceteris paribus may lead to an increase in the balance of trade, impact on employment levels, economic growth, inflation.
MAX 3 marks overall

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)Evaluation should use relevant analysis to consider the importance of both measures and make a judgement as to which one may be of most concern to an economy (1). Reserve one mark for a justified conclusion (1).

Usually, this will be a cause-and-effect statement (""explain how a decrease in interest rates could cause economic growth"") or something that requires you to identify two or three different factors (""Explain three causes of unemployment"").
                - Your analysis paragraph will be in two parts:
                    - Knowledge and understanding, worth 3 marks. Define the key terms in the question and explain what they mean, e.g. ""unemployment is the state of being willing and able to work but not having a paid job.""
                    - Analysis, worth 3 marks. Explain the statement in the question, e.g. ""One cause of employment is frictional unemployment, which is ...""
    
                Part 2: Evaluation. Roughly 80 words. (Worth 2 marks.)
                
                - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
                - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point.
                - Please keep these points separate from the analysis paragraph. Elaborate on each point in depth. Put all the evaluation points in one paragraph and include a conclusion that combines all the points in the end.

Note: the correct KU of the meaning of income elasticity may be rewarded with 1 mark if it is clear within the application even if it was initially incorrect within an opening statement / definition.
For application that explains the meaning of a normal good (1 mark) and uses a diagram to illustrate that the demand curve will shift to the left (1 mark) leading to a fall in equilibrium price and quantity demanded which is clearly shown on the diagram (1 mark).
For application that explains the meaning of an inferior good (1 mark) and uses a separate diagram to illustrate that the demand curve will shift to the right (1 mark) leading to a rise in equilibrium price and quantity demanded which is clearly shown on the diagram (1 mark).

8

For a normal good, at a time when incomes are falling, demand will be expected to fall resulting in a shift to the left of the demand curve. For an inferior good, at a time when incomes are falling, demand will be expected to rise resulting in a shift to the right of the demand curve. This will result in a fall and rise respectively in the equilibrium price and quantity demanded which should be clearly shown on two separate diagrams as required by the question Do not reward application where one diagram is used to illustrate the effects on both types of goods. The maximum mark that this type of response could score is [2+3+1]
Diagrams showing the relationship between income and q demanded for normal and inferior goods must not be rewarded (unless solely used as part of the explanation of the meaning of what normal and inferior goods are) as they clearly do not show the changes in equilibrium price and quantity. The only diagrams that may be accepted here are normal supply and demand diagrams that clearly show the appropriate shifts in demand and the resulting changes in equilibrium price and quantity demanded.

An economy moves from a deficit to a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments
Explain what is meant by a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments and consider the possible impact on the level of employment and prices when there is a change from a deficit to a surplus current account balance in an economy.
For knowledge and understanding of what the current account of the balance of payments measures (1 mark) and what is meant by a surplus (1 mark)
For application that explains the impact of the emerging surplus upon employment. (Up to 3 marks)
For application that explains the impact of the emerging surplus upon domestic prices. (Up to 3 marks)

8

The current account should be defined as trade in goods, services plus other income.
For the second mark, a surplus is where payments received by a country exceed payments made by a country / where income from exports exceeds expenditure on imports.
The cause of the surplus will clearly be an increase in exports and / or a decrease in imports. However, there are several reasons why this might occur e.g., increased popularity of Russian exports, government policy to dampen domestic demand etc. Give 1 mark for identifying a valid cause / reason and then up to 2 marks for a developed explanation of the impact on employment and use the same criteria to award marks for the impact on domestic prices.

A decrease in the price of a product will increase the consumer surplus as more consumers are willing to pay the lower price. The extent of this will depend on the price elasticity of demand for a product. In the case of a luxury product with many substitutes, PED will be elastic. In the case of an essential product with few substitutes, PED will be inelastic.

Definition of a floating exchange rate system:

one in which the exchange rate is determined by the intersection of the demand for a currency and the supply of a currency or not fixed by the government

Diagram:

vertical axis needs to indicate that it is the price of a currency rather than any price in order for the diagram to be given a mark, assuming that D and S are correctly labelled

Factors that could bring about a depreciation:

a decrease in the demand for a currency, e.g. if fewer exports are sold
an increase in the supply of a currency, e.g. if more imports are bought
lower interest rates
a higher rate of inflation compared with trading competitors because exports will be less competitive
a deficit in the balance of payments on current account will contribute to a depreciation

Generate responses to data-response questions in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        Formatting & Structure
        1.	Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2.	Match length to marks:
        •	2-3 marks: 1–2 sentences (direct answer, no analysis).
        •	4-5 marks: 1–2 paragraphs (explain concepts + 1-2 article quotes).
        •	6-8 marks: 3–4 paragraphs (analyze both sides, use theory + evidence).
        •   Questions asking to ""state"": simple statement of point.
        •   Questions asking to ""explain"": 1 statement of a point + an explanation of that point based on A-Level economics knowledge.
        •   Questions asking to ""consider"", ""discuss"", or ""assess"": full analysis of valid points on both sides of the argument + conclusion that reaches a final judgement.
        Theory & Article Integration
        1.	Name and explain syllabus concepts (e.g., “Monopolies restrict output due to their downward-sloping AR curve, leading to allocative inefficiency where P > MC”).
        2.	Quote the article directly, if asked to do so in the question (e.g., “The ‘US$68 billion profits’ reflect supernormal profits”).
        3.	Reference diagrams in text (e.g., “In a negative externality diagram, MSC lies above MPC”).
        4.  You should quote the article whenever necessary, but ensure that if the question does not ask you about the article, focus predominantly on economic theory.
        High-Mark Elaboration (6-8 marks)
        For every theoretical claim, include:
        1.	Cause: “X occurs because...” (e.g., “Prices rise because monopolies set output where MR=MC”).
        2.	Effect: “This leads to...” (e.g., “Higher prices reduce consumer surplus”).
        3.	Chain of reasoning: “As a result...” (e.g., “Predatory pricing deters competitors, reducing contestability”).
        4.	Syllabus example: “This aligns with the concept of...” (e.g., “Barriers to entry”).
        Non-Negotiables
        -   DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        •	Avoid shorthand: Replace “shifts supply” → “An excise tax shifts S left from S1 to S2, raising equilibrium price from P1 to P2.”


        Question: Pakistan's agriculture survives on subsidies
As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.
Table 1.1: Cost of production after subsidies of selected products in Pakistan and India, 2018 (Pakistan Rupees per unit)

The higher cost of production in Pakistan has serious implications for Pakistan's participation in global trade in agricultural products. This problem is particularly critical as Pakistan seeks to increase exports to reduce a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.
A complaint of farmers is that GST, a sales tax, is charged when they purchase fertilisers. In May, the government gave in to pressure and cut GST on fertilisers from 17% to 2%. Farmers' leaders want the tax to be completely removed from fertiliser sales. Their priority, however, is for a large increase in the subsidy paid to farmers to a level comparable to that paid to farmers in India. In Pakistan's current economic position this prospect appears to be remote.
Pakistan's farmers also complain about the subsidies that are paid to farmers in richer neighbouring countries. They strongly argue that these subsidies are unfair on farmers from developing countries and are holding back their economic development.

        ","Pakistan's agriculture survives on subsidies
As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

Explain how the lower level of subsidy currently paid to Pakistan's farmers is likely to affect Pakistan's trade in agricultural goods when competing with India in international markets.
It is likely to make exports of Pakistan's agricultural products less price competitive / imports of India's agricultural products more price competitive (1) and the resulting reduction in exports (1) and increasing imports (1) is likely to lead to a (increased) deficit in Pakistan's trade in agricultural goods (1)
Up to a maximum of 3 marks

Responses may consider the following points within the explanation:

Pakistan is already at a cost disadvantage when trading with India
Pakistan's agricultural exports are likely to be less competitive than similar exports from India
Lower subsidies exaggerate the cost differences
Could mean that imports of staple foods from India increase
Other countries will buy more goods from India due to cost difference

        Question: The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.
Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth. The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.
For South Africa’s economy to grow it needs to address major infrastructure issues. Also, in disadvantaged communities the education system is weak contributing to a skills shortage and a rise in the unemployment rate to 27% (see Fig. 1.2). Increased production is further hindered by restrictive trade union practices.

An analyst said: ‘A critical reason for low economic growth has been a lack of private sector investment and FDI (see Fig. 1.3). The lack of investment wasn’t just due to the political policies but also to uncertainty and mismanagement which led to continued inequalities.’

Extract 1: Thailand's economy shows improved health
The latest figures show that Thailand's economy grew by 3.5% in the second quarter, putting it on track for 3–3.5% growth for the whole of 2016. Thailand has managed to boost its growth after several quarters of disappointing performance by increasing public sector investment in several large infrastructure projects, including roads, railways and airports. These projects will run over the next 3 to 5 years and are worth several hundred billion baht, Thailand's currency. It is hoped that this public sector investment will encourage the private sector to increase their investment spending.
In addition to increased investment, the Thai economy's growth is being boosted by recovering private consumption due to increases in farm prices, which are crucial to household purchasing power, as well as a strong tourism sector.
Regarding the export sector, which remains the biggest engine of growth, the outlook is still uncertain but the negative impact from China's economic slowdown appears to have stabilised with a Chinese growth rate of around 6.6% per annum.
Source: The Nation, 18 August 2016
Extract 2: Thailand's tourism industry continues to grow
The Thai tourism industry is projected to record international visitor arrivals of 16.67 million between January and June 2016, which will be up by 13% over the same period of 2015. Projected earnings are estimated at 824 billion baht, up 17%. The top three markets in terms of tourism receipts are projected to be China (146 billion baht, +32%), Malaysia (22.5 billion baht, +15%) and Australia (17.8 billion baht, +4%). China is now by far the largest source of visitors, but there has been a resumption of growth from Russia and Thailand’s neighbouring countries of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

Consumption is likely to increase. Two approaches are expected. One relates to the impact of the fall in the rate of interest upon the cost of loans. The other upon the impact upon savings. Candidates can either give a developed explanation of one approach or give a brief explanation of the two approaches.

        Question: Increasing public sector debt is a good policy
Politicians do not usually think it a success to borrow a large amount of money but, in June 2020, when the economy was approaching a recession, the United Kingdom (UK) borrowed five times as much as it did in June 2019. This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.

Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.
There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession. 
The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.
However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.

        Question: Health and well-being
European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

        ","Health and well-being
European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

        Question: Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories. This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

What is meant by ‘quantitative easing’?    [3]","1(a)
The central bank creates money through its open-market operations. It involves the purchase of bonds with cash which increases the stock of money held by banks and financial institutions. This would have an effect on interest rate and increases the potential for lending in the economy.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla

Extract 1: Thailand's economy shows improved health
The latest figures show that Thailand's economy grew by 3.5% in the second quarter, putting it on track for 3–3.5% growth for the whole of 2016. Thailand has managed to boost its growth after several quarters of disappointing performance by increasing public sector investment in several large infrastructure projects, including roads, railways and airports. These projects will run over the next 3 to 5 years and are worth several hundred billion baht, Thailand's currency. It is hoped that this public sector investment will encourage the private sector to increase their investment spending.
In addition to increased investment, the Thai economy's growth is being boosted by recovering private consumption due to increases in farm prices, which are crucial to household purchasing power, as well as a strong tourism sector.
Regarding the export sector, which remains the biggest engine of growth, the outlook is still uncertain but the negative impact from China's economic slowdown appears to have stabilised with a Chinese growth rate of around 6.6% per annum.

Extract 2: Thailand's tourism industry continues to grow
The Thai tourism industry is projected to record international visitor arrivals of 16.67 million between January and June 2016, which will be up by 13% over the same period of 2015. Projected earnings are estimated at 824 billion baht, up 17%. The top three markets in terms of tourism receipts are projected to be China (146 billion baht, +32%), Malaysia (22.5 billion baht, +15%) and Australia (17.8 billion baht, +4%). China is now by far the largest source of visitors, but there has been a resumption of growth from Russia and Thailand’s neighbouring countries of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

3
The impact on export expenditure depends upon a number of factors and there are a number of possible outcomes.• The fall in interest rates will decrease the value of the baht and this could lead to a rise or fall in export earnings depending upon the price elasticity of exports• The fall in interest rates might result in more spending in Thailand and as a result Thai exports might be diverted to the home market and export earnings could fall.• The fall in the rate of interest might lead to more investment inThailand that results in more productivity in export industries and export earnings might rise.

In 2018, real output in China's economy grew by 6.6%, its lowest figure this century (see Fig. 1.1). Many economists believe that growth in China's real output will continue to be around this level over the next few years.
In looking to the future, the Chinese government has sought to restructure its economy. This has resulted in an increased contribution from domestic consumption, with less reliance on large-scale manufacturing in favour of quality manufacturing. For Chinese consumers, buying a house is the main priority, followed by purchasing a new car. Table 1.1 shows the annual rate of change in new car sales from 2010 to 2017.
China's plans for maintaining its growth in real output at a rate of around 6.6% are threatened by ongoing tensions over trade with the United States (US). These tensions provide a real threat to China meeting even its most pessimistic growth targets for real output. Various studies have estimated the effects of a protectionist trade war with the US on China's economy. These estimates are all negative and range from –0.6% to –1.4% of real output.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla 



Ice cream producers can use natural vanilla or vanillin to produce ice cream.

        Question: Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla 



Ice cream producers can use natural vanilla or vanillin to produce ice cream.

        Question: Argentina announces lifting of currency controlsArgentina's new government has removed foreign currency controls, allowing its citizens to buy US dollars freely for the first time in four years. These currency controls have been in place as part of a fixed exchange rate system. The move, which officials hope will boost the faltering economy, is the strongest President Macri has yet made in his bid to reduce the government interference that marked the country's economy under the previous presidencies. Removing foreign currency controls was the latest in a series of moves President Macri has made since he took office. His administration has also eliminated most farm export taxes and cut personal income taxes.The decision carries significant short term risks but equally big long term rewards if it leads to greater investment and lifts the country's failing export sector.In the short term, the move is likely to cause the biggest currency depreciation since Argentina's economic meltdown in 2002.Economists expect the Argentinian currency, the peso, to fall from its current official exchange rate of US$1 = 9.8 peso to something closer to the rate used in the black (illegal) market, about US$1 = 14.5 peso. This would be a fall of a third of its value.Lifting foreign currency controls came on the same day the US central bank raised its interest rate for the first time since 2006, making it relatively harder for other countries, including Argentina, to attract funds. A weaker peso will add to the country's already high inflation rate of 25%. To try to control price rises and attract funds, Argentina's central bank raised its interest rate to 38%.Amid rampant inflation and a lack of faith in the peso, Argentinian consumers and firms sought security in holding US dollars. Combined with rising demand from Argentina's government – which needed US dollars to make debt payments and pay for energy imports – this resulted in a shortage of US dollars in Argentina. To address this problem, former President Kirchner largely banned the sale of US dollars in 2011 but this led to the creation of a currency black market.The ban failed to contain inflation, which was among the world's highest throughout President Kirchner's term of office. Firms, meanwhile, struggled to obtain US dollars to buy parts and equipment, stifling growth and sometimes causing critical shortages at places like hospitals, which depend on imported supplies and equipment.Source: Wall Street Journal, 16 December 2015

Fixing the price of the peso means that there is a shortage of dollars in the market. This should drive up the price, but this is not permitted. As a result dollars trade at an unofficial price that is above the official price. This is a black (illegal) market.

        Question: Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories. This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

        Question: Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories.

        Question: Divergences in economic performance
A report considered the determinants of long-term economic growth and rated economies on their global competitiveness using an index from 7 to 1. Labour productivity is one influence on the competitiveness of an economy and labour productivity also determines the level of prosperity that a country can achieve. Switzerland, Singapore and the United States (US) were the world’s three most competitive economies (see Table 1.1). Countries in the Euro Area were also ranked in the report. The Euro Area is a monetary union of 19 countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla 



Ice cream producers can use natural vanilla or vanillin to produce ice cream.

        Question: The effects of European Union (EU) labour migration
In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.
A critic of this free movement of labour stated that ""It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages.""
In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported ""There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services. Wages may have been affected for low-skilled workers but only marginally downward.""
Other economists have argued that, in theory, ""the impacts of immigration on wages and employment critically depends on whether migrants' skills are complements to, or substitutes for, the skills of existing workers. These impacts vary between the short run and long run. In the short run if the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages. If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in wages of existing workers. In the long run the economy can adjust to the increase in labour supply.""
Some governments have introduced a minimum wage to help those workers on low pay. The wage is set to increase to match any increase in inflation.

        Question: Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories. This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

What is meant by ‘quantitative easing’?    [3]","1(a)
The central bank creates money through its open-market operations. It involves the purchase of bonds with cash which increases the stock of money held by banks and financial institutions. This would have an effect on interest rate and increases the potential for lending in the economy.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla

        Question: Divergences in economic performance
A report considered the determinants of long-term economic growth and rated economies on their global competitiveness using an index from 7 to 1. Labour productivity is one influence on the competitiveness of an economy and labour productivity also determines the level of prosperity that a country can achieve. Switzerland, Singapore and the United States (US) were the world’s three most competitive economies (see Table 1.1). Countries in the Euro Area were also ranked in the report. The Euro Area is a monetary union of 19 countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

        Question: Increasing public sector debt is a good policy
Politicians do not usually think it a success to borrow a large amount of money but, in June 2020, when the economy was approaching a recession, the United Kingdom (UK) borrowed five times as much as it did in June 2019. This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.

Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.
There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession. 
The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.
However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.

This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.

Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.
There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession. 
The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.
However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.

        Question: Health and well-being
European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

The WHO suggested that governments should consider introducing sugar taxes, a minimum price for alcohol and also subsidies on fruit and vegetables.
To try and limit smoking, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has conducted advertising campaigns warning of the dangers of smoking and banned smoking in public places. It has also put high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, it has refused to place a tax on all sugar consumption and there are no minimum prices for alcohol.

        Question: Trade war breaks out between the United States (US) and China

Fig 1.1: Components of the US current account, Q1 2010 to Q1 2018 

Fig. 1.2: Chinese yuan to US dollar rate of exchange, August 2017 to July 2018 
Extract 1: The US government says, ‘We are confronting China’s unfair trade policies’ 
For many years, China has pursued industrial policies and unfair trade practices – including dumping, discriminatory non-tariff barriers and industrial subsidies – that favour Chinese firms and make it impossible for many US firms to compete. China imposes much higher tariffs on US exports than the US imposes on China. China’s average tariff rate is nearly three times higher than the average US rate. Certain products are even more imbalanced, for instance the US charges a 2.5% tariff on Chinese cars, while China currently maintains a 25% tariff on cars from the US. China has banned imports of some US agricultural products, excluding US farmers from a major market for their goods. China has dumped and unfairly subsidised a range of goods for the US market, undermining US domestic firms. In 2018 alone, the US government has found dumping or unfair subsidies on 13 different products.
Source: The White House, US government, 29 May 2018
Extract 2: Winners and losers in the US–China trade war
The US government imposed a first round of tariffs on Chinese goods on 6 July 2018, by introducing 25% taxes on US$34 billion of Chinese imports. These were a response to China’s“unfair trade policies” – the US claimed China was selling Chinese products in the US below their normal price, called ‘dumping’, as well as subsidising the production of goods exported to the US. It was then announced that tariffs on a further US$50 billion worth of imports from China would come into effect. The US threats have risen since, with the president saying he is ready to impose tariffs on all US$500 billion of Chinese imports.
China has retaliated, saying it will levy new tariffs on more than 5200 US products, if the US government proceeds with its latest tariff threat. The duties would range from 5% to 25% on US$60 billion worth of US products imported into China, including further agricultural products such as soya beans.
The US government imposed tariffs because they said that the “unfair trade practices” have resulted in a US trade deficit with China, but this makes no sense. The trade deficit is an inevitable by-product of a robust US economy, a large US fiscal deficit and a strong US dollar. If correcting the US trade deficit is the government’s policy aim then it should raise US taxes to reduce the fiscal deficit and the US central bank should act to lower the value of the US dollar against China’s currency, the yuan.
Both countries will lose in a major trade war, but the losses will differ in kind and amount. It could cut China’s exports to the US by about a third, some US$200 billion annually. Eventually, Chinese firms will find new markets and create new products to compensate. For a period of two or three years, however, the disruption to workers and firms will be enormous. As many as 4 million Chinese workers could become unemployed, and many Chinese firms will go out of business. 
If US exports to China are cut by a third in a major trade war, the US will lose about US$50 billion of exports annually. About 250000 US workers will lose their jobs. If US firms can see no end to the trade war, they will reorganise and locate production in lower-cost countries like Vietnam and Peru. The Chinese government, however, will strongly encourage Chinese firms to produce many of their goods at home, even though the cost will be much higher.

        Question: The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil
Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland. 
Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt. 
Nations producing palm oil view it as a means of reducing poverty, while international finance organisations regard it as an engine of growth for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) encouraged Malaysia and Indonesia to cultivate natural resources and to produce more palm oil in spite of an awareness of high external costs. Dutch banks provided more than US$12 billion in loans to Indonesian producers. Palm oil is Indonesia’s main export earner. 
Widespread adoption of palm oil began when, in 1995, one of the world's major multinational companies decided to use it in its global food manufacturing industries instead of animal fats and other vegetable oils, which were then said to be unhealthy. It invested heavily in expanding palm oil plantations in Malaysia and achieved considerable cost savings because palm oil has a much higher yield per hectare than other vegetable oils.
Palm oil's versatility is not limited to food. It is used in 70% of personal care products (toiletries) such as soap, shampoo and make-up. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel fuel.
As the palm oil industry expanded, conservationists began to raise the alarm about the devastating effects from carbon emissions and on wildlife habitats. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of some rare animals. 
In 2019, one supermarket promised to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. Norway banned imports for biodiesel production. The European Parliament proposed that public subsidies for biodiesel should be removed by 2021. If this proposal is enacted it will affect the demand for biodiesel and may force palm oil producing countries to reduce deforestation programmes, leading to improved environmental sustainability.

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

        Question: French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

        Question: The United States (US) EconomyAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the US in the first quarter of 2015, the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 0.2% compared with an increase of 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase reflected positive contributions from consumption expenditure and company investment. These were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP,increased. Some selected changes in GDP contributions are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Selected changes in US GDP components

The slower overall growth of GDP in the first quarter of 2015 may have been linked to changes in other countries. China's economic growth rate was reported to have dropped from over 10% to 7%; the Russian economy was affected by low oil prices and economic sanctions; Brazil was experiencing high inflation and low business confidence; Canada's economic growth rate was predicted to decrease because of lower oil prices.In addition to changes in other countries, business spending in the US on equipment, machinery and buildings decreased.There was, however, some revival in consumer confidence. House prices rose on average by 5% and a rising demand for housing was expected to continue. The labour market appeared to be improving with unfilled job vacancies at their highest level since 2008. Larger companies were reported to be about to offer pay rises to their lower paid workers. Wage growth, however, has to be paid for somehow and executives said that they had little room for cutting other costs. This, together with fierce competition, made it difficult to increase prices: cuts in profits seemed more likely.Source: Sunday Times, 3 May 2015

        Question: Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla 



Ice cream producers can use natural vanilla or vanillin to produce ice cream.

The rise in the price of vanilla from 2015 to 2018 was caused by • a decrease in the demand for vanillin as a result of concern about the health risks which caused an increase in the demand for vanilla. • a decrease in supply of vanilla caused by ‘poor harvests’ and the cyclone A decrease in supply as vanilla farmers withdrew from the industry is not an acceptable explanation because of the time period. Some candidates are providing an explanation of both a decrease in supply and a rise in demand. This is acceptable, but only one reason is required for the mark available.

        ","Analyse the differences between a normal good, an inferior good and a Giffen good. Discuss whether knowledge of these differences is all that is required by a company considering changing the price of its product. [13]","b

Analysis of the difference between income and substitution effects and the overall effect on demand of a change in price. Whether demand will increase, and by how much for a price fall depends on the classification of the good but also on the price elasticity of demand. The company would also need to know if it increased production how that would affect costs – and thus profits.L4 (9–13 marks): there are three aspects to the question: a clear explanation of the analysis – income, substitution; a comment on the effect on demand and a comment on the relation to revenue via elasticity.Good reasoned structure.L3 (7–8 marks): for a less developed analysis of the income substitution effects, or of the link to demand, or a weaker link to the revenue. Two aspects done reasonable well, or three less developed.L2 (5–6 marks): for an answer that either deals with one aspect well, or two with less clarity.
L1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includesirrelevancies and errors of theory.

Analysis of the theory of wages distinguishing between perfect and imperfect markets and recognising that the success of a higher wage claim will depend on where the original wage level was and how much extra the claim was for. There is a bigger scope for wage claim success in imperfect competition. Level 4 (9–13 marks): for an analysis of wage determination including a clear analysis of MRP and a clear comparison of perfect and imperfect markets recognising the comparison of the initial and the final wage level. There should be a conclusion. (Without MRP cannot reach L4) Level 3 (7–8 marks): for a weaker analysis and critique of the possibility of wage increases but a competent explanation of imperfect market wage determination. Level 2 (5–6 marks): for a correct but undeveloped analysis with only a brief discussion. Level 1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        ",Distinguish between the income and substitution effects of a change in a good's price and analyse why the effect of a change in price is not always the same for different goods. [13],"b
Distinguish between the income and substitution effects of a change in a good’s price and analyse why the effect of a change in price is not always the same for different goods. A price fall is reflected in a change in the budget line (pivot from point on axis of the good with no price change) with a subsequent change in equilibrium. The equilibrium change involves substitution and income effects. Substitution effect would be in the opposite direction to the price change. The income effect is represented by a parallel shift of the budget line is in the same direction as the substitution effect for the normal good but in the opposite direction for an inferior and Giffen good. Demand will increase for a normal good, but the extent will depend on elasticity, it will increase for an inferior good but not as much as for a normal good. For a Giffen good the final demand is less than the original demand. L4 (9–13 marks) For a reasoned and clear discussion, logically presented dealing with income, substitution effects and at least two different types of good, (normal, inferior, Giffen).  L3 (7–8 marks) For a fair but undeveloped discussion probably concentrating on income, substitution. Mention might be made of different elasticities of a normal good or of the difference between normal goods and inferior/Giffen. There would be only a brief comment on the individual demand curve or no discussion about the demand curve.  L2 (5–6 marks) For a limited explanation with a lack of development of both income/substitution and different types of good.  L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure. [13],"b

Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure.
Collusion takes place when firms find that it is in their interest to co-operate with their rivals to maximise profits. Usually this will mean that firms agree together to fix output or prices or both output and price. This is known as forming a cartel. It is also known as formal collusion and is usually illegal. Sometimes an informal agreement takes place (tacit collusion). In this a dominant firm will set the price/output and other firms will then do the same. It is possible to identify specific factors which would favour collusion. These might include firms are likely to produce similar products using similar production methods; firms will be large, often with a dominant firm; there are significant barriers to entry; the market they operate in is usually stable; governments do not interfere.
Not all market structures are likely to fulfil these conditions. Firms operating in perfectly competitive markets are price takers and there are no barriers to entry. Firms operating in monopolistic competition are very small, they sell differentiated products and there are no barriers to entry. Monopoly firms, are large but by definition, do not face competition because they control all the market, so collusion would not be relevant. Oligopoly markets consist of a few large firms, which often produce similar types of goods and use barriers to entry. These factors would produce the ideal conditions to promote collusive behaviour. Therefore it is reasonable to agree with the view that collusion will only take place in an Oligopoly market.
It should be noted that although collusion can take place it does not automatically ensure that it will. Also, Oligopoly firms will still compete with each other through alternative means such as advertising and/or product differentiation. It should also be recognised that many cartel agreements break down because of cheating or one or more firms not fully sticking to the agreed rules.
L4 (9–13 marks) For a clear explanation what is meant by collusion. The key characteristics of a market which are necessary to enable firms to collude successfully should be identified. Each of the market structures should be discussed in relation to the possibility of collusion taking place. A conclusion which addresses the specific question should then be provided. L3 (7–8 marks) For an accurate explanation of collusion and a more limited explanation with regard to the conditions necessary for it to take place. At least two types of market structures should be discussed in relation to the specific question and a brief conclusion should be provided. L2 (5–6 marks) For a briefer descriptive explanation of collusion and a reference to at least one condition necessary for it to take place. Reference to one type of market structure should be made but no conclusion will be provided in relation to the specific question. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Discuss whether the existence of (i) inferior goods and (ii) advertising invalidates the underlying assumptions of those theories of demand. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Discuss whether the existence of (i) inferior goods and (ii) advertising invalidates the underlying assumptions of those theories of demand. [13],"b
Inferior goods would result in a different outcome when prices change from the outcome of a normal good, but they do not invalidate the underlying assumptions of the theory. Indifference curve theory can show more precisely why the difference occurs using income and substitution effects. Advertising does not necessarily invalidate the theory but it could be that persuasive advertising results in more being purchased at a higher price – this could still be explained using the theory as either utility is perceived as changing, or can be shown using the indifference curve diagrams. The assumptions have not changed. Level 4 (9–13 marks): for a reasoned and clear discussion, logically presented dealing with income, substitution, inferior and advertising.Level 3 (7–8 marks): for a fair but undeveloped discussion probably concentrating on income, substitution of inferior goods or persuasive advertising, but still with a conclusion.Level 2 (5–6 marks): for a briefer discussion of both inferior and advertising.Level 1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Discuss the extent to which monopoly producers and the consumers of their products might benefit from the existence of barriers to entry. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Discuss the extent to which monopoly producers and the consumers of their products might benefit from the existence of barriers to entry. [13],"b

Discuss the extent to which monopoly producers and the consumers of their products might benefit from the existence of barriers to entry.
Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the state might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Potential benefits to the monopolist might include: higher profits; increase in efficiency; increase in market share; growth of the firm. The consumer benefits might include: lower prices; higher quality product; greater availability of a product.
Responses might refer to a range of alternative barriers to entry including: economies of scale; branding/advertising; legal requirements/patents; natural monopolies; limit pricing. Good responses will choose at least two types of barrier and discuss how each might have a positive/negative effect on both the producer and the consumer. For example, economies of scale might increase Monopoly profits by lowering unit costs but also benefit the consumer by possible subsequent price reductions. Similarly, the use of limit pricing to prevent new entrants might lower prices for the consumer in the short run but lead to a higher market share and higher profits in the long run.
On a more general note, some barriers might allow a monopolist to maintain profits in the long run and invest in research and development thus achieving dynamic efficiency. These benefits might by be passed on to the consumer through lower prices, higher quality products and more choice. Alternatively, barriers might lead to complacency and X inefficiency which is likely to lead to higher prices and lower quality products.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a clear, explanation of two barriers to entry and a discussion of how each of the barriers might have both a negative and positive effect on the producer and the consumer. An attempt should be made to summarize the extent to which producers/consumers might achieve a net benefit.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a fair explanation of two barriers which focuses upon either the potential costs/benefits to the producer or consumer only or an explanation which does not attempt to examine both costs and benefits in both cases. A brief conclusion referring to the extent of the costs/benefits might be made.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of different types of barrier to entry but does not identify specific costs/benefits and does not distinguish clearly between costs/benefits to the producer and costs/benefits to the consumer.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

Analysis of the theory of wages distinguishing between perfect and imperfect markets and recognising that the success of a higher wage claim will depend on where the original wage level was and how much extra the claim was for. There is a bigger scope for wage claim success in imperfect competition. Level 4 (9–13 marks): for an analysis of wage determination including a clear analysis of MRP and a clear comparison of perfect and imperfect markets recognising the comparison of the initial and the final wage level. There should be a conclusion. (Without MRP cannot reach L4) Level 3 (7–8 marks): for a weaker analysis and critique of the possibility of wage increases but a competent explanation of imperfect market wage determination. Level 2 (5–6 marks): for a correct but undeveloped analysis with only a brief discussion. Level 1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: How far would you agree that the use of budget deficits is the most effective way to solve the problem of a deflationary gap? [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",How far would you agree that the use of budget deficits is the most effective way to solve the problem of a deflationary gap? [13],"b
Responses should indicate a clear understanding of what is meant by a budget deficit and the economic circumstances where governments would choose to use them. Reference should then be briefly made to the problems created by a deflationary gap and the links between these and the use of budget deficits. Some attempt should be made to discuss the effectiveness of using budget deficits and also some consideration of alternatives such as the reliance on the operation of market forces and/or the use of supply side policies. L4 (9–13): for responses that recognise there are problems associated with deficit financing such as crowding out, long term effects on the price level. Higher level four responses will then consider alternative approaches such as supply side policies and/or market liberalisation. A conclusion should be provided. L3 (7–8): for responses that analyse the links between the use of budget deficits and deflationary gaps. Clear diagrams illustrating how deficits can be used to close the gap will be provided. Some attempt should be made to develop answers which recognise that budget deficits alone are unlikely to solve problems associated with negative expectations.

        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 13-mark **A-Level** (not AS-Level) structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow this structure:
        - The question will usually ask you to ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" an economic statement statement, or ask you whether you ""agree or disagree"".
        - This requires an answer in two parts. Aim to reach roughly 750 words total.
        - If the question is purely explanatory (no ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" or ""agree or disagree"" or ""evaluate""), then:
            - You will be asked to explain an economic statement. Think of all the points you will need to explain first to properly explain that statement.
            - For example, ""The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained.""
            - Your task is to elaborate on each of these sub-points using as much economic detail as possible. 
            - For each of these points, you will need to:
                - Define and explain the keywords in the point, e.g. ""Collusion refers to agreements between firms to fix prices, usually above the market equilibrium in an oligopoly market. This can be in the form of tacit collusion, which does not involve formal agreements, or in the form of a formal agreement and the formation of a cartel.""
                - Explain the point with a cause-and-effect chain if applicable (""Firms may choose to collude because of the Prisoner's Dilemma innate in an oligopoly. If a firm sets its price high, all other firms will set their prices low and the firm setting high prices will lose out on all its consumers; this results in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium and firms can counteract this by agreeing to set prices high together."")
        - If the question countains an evaluation part (""And consider whether..."", ""Discuss..."", ""Evaluate..."", mark scheme mentioning an ""evaluation""):
             - Follow all of the above for the explanation part.
             - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
             - Points may include: the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
             - You will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
             - This should be at the very end of your essay.
             - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
             - Offer a conclusion combining all the evauation points.

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your explanation paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation, if the question asks for it. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             
        - Your response will be approximately 750 words.


        Question: Discuss whether it is sometimes necessary to use the public sector to try to achieve economic efficiency rather than the private sector. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Discuss whether it is sometimes necessary to use the public sector to try to achieve economic efficiency rather than the private sector. [13],"b
Individual actions are not always best for society as a whole. Discussion of reasons for market failure and hence the necessity/desirability of government intervention to achieve efficiency. Intervention could be by persuasion (nudge theory) rather than by enforcement, by designing choices to encourage decision-making in wider positive interests of society. Government intervention may thus be necessary, but it might not be sufficient to overcome inefficiency as there can be inefficiency in government through lack of information. L4 (9–13): for an accurate discussion of market failure, with examples and a conclusion about the need for government intervention and whether such intervention is a sufficient solution L3 (7–8): for a more limited discussion of the reasons for market failure and the need for the government but without a comment on whether such intervention is sufficient to overcome market failure L2 (5–6): for a brief analysis of market failure with few examples and no conclusion about necessity or sufficiency L1 (1–4): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory

        Question: To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to achieve economic growth without simultaneously causing a balance of payments deficit? [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to achieve economic growth without simultaneously causing a balance of payments deficit? [13],"b
To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to achieve economic growth without simultaneously causing a balance of payments deficit?Answers should establish that economic growth and a stable balance of payments are key macroeconomic goals. Alternative policies required to promote economic growth should be explained and analysed. Candidates should then proceed to examine the potential impact of economic growth on the balance of payments.Alternative approaches which use circular income flow or Keynesian AD/AS analysis might be used. Evaluative comment will attempt to consider the extent of the impact of economic growth on the level of national income and imports. Similarly, analysis of the links between policies to promote economic growth and a balance of payments deficit will be discussed. For example, economic growth should lead to a rise in incomes which is likely to lead to a higher level of imports which, in turn, would cause/increase a balance of payments deficit. Evaluative comment will consider the extent of the impact of economic growth and a balance of payments deficit. A conclusion, based on the preceding analysis, will then attempt to show how far it is possible to agree with the statement under consideration. L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer that examines alternative policies to achieve economic growth. For example, short run demand side and long run supply side. Responses will analyse and evaluate the impact of at least one approach on a balance of payments deficit. A conclusion will discuss the extent to which the outcome referred to in the statement is possible. L3 (7–8 marks): For an answer which analyses the impact of economic growth on a balance of payments deficit with some evaluative comment or a response which analyses both elements of the question but makes no attempt to discuss the view under consideration.L2 (5–6 marks): For an answer which explains policies which can be introduced to achieve economic growth but focuses upon describing the potential impact on a balance of payments deficit. A conclusion will not be provided. L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant

        Question: The introduction of a national minimum wage will always benefit employees at the expense of employers.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",The introduction of a national minimum wage will always benefit employees at the expense of employers.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement. [13],"b

The introduction of a national minimum wage by a government will always benefit employees at the expense of employers.
Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement
Answers should clearly identify and explain why a government might wish to introduce a minimum wage. Aims might include: to protect basic living standards; ensure a more equitable distribution of income; encourage individuals to get a job and encourage labour productivity. Analysis should then attempt to show the impact of a minimum wage imposed above the existing market equilibrium. This analysis can then be linked to the specific statement in the question by considering why the effect of an increase in wages will be different, depending upon the type of market under consideration and/or the respective elasticities of the supply of and demand for labour in each case. ‘always’ is a key word in the statement and it is assumed that candidates will question whether this is acceptable. For example, it can be argued that the incentive effect of higher wages might lead to higher levels of labour productivity which will benefit the employer as well as the employee. Also references to possible positive/negative macroeconomic effects might be made. For example, higher minimum wage leads to higher overall costs which might lead to higher prices, higher cost of living. A conclusion should attempt to address the specific question based on preceding analysis.
L4 (9–13 marks): At least 2 factors should be identified which support the assertion that employees will benefit from the imposition of a minimum wage. These benefits should be discussed using appropriate analysis. The extent to which these benefits are then attained at the expense of employers should then be fully discussed, referring to different types of labour market etc. A conclusion should attempt to make a judgement relating to whether the attained benefits are always gained at the expense of the employers.
L3 (7–8 marks): For competent analysis which clearly demonstrates the potential impact of a minimum wage on an employee via higher wages but is also aware that there are potential costs e.g. higher prices, job losses. Some brief comment might be provided regarding possible benefits gained by employers but this will not be fully developed. A conclusion addressing the specific question will not be provided.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a brief and less developed explanation of the potential benefits to the employee of a minimum wage but this will not be supported by any in-depth analysis. There will be no attempt to consider the impact of a minimum wage on the employer.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Assess the view that supply-side policies are the most effective way to solve the problem of structural unemployment. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Assess the view that supply-side policies are the most effective way to solve the problem of structural unemployment. [13],"b
Supply side polices are government policies that attempt to alter the level of aggregate supply directly rather than through changes in aggregate demand. They can be market oriented or through direct government intervention. Interventionist policies might include: education and training. Market policies might include taxation; reduction in unemployment benefits – these policies would aim to increase labour geographical/occupation mobility and enable specific focus on unemployment caused by changes in the pattern of demand. Alternative policies such as Keynesian demand management policies would not be suitable because they would lack focus and may cause problems in those areas which are not experiencing high unemployment. However, supply-side policies often take a long time and they are frequently costly. L4 (9–13): for a discussion of the extent of the effectiveness of supply-side polices with some attempt to compare alternative demand management policies and some attempt to identify potential problems such as, the long time period needed for success or the high cost of intervention. There should be a conclusion. L3 (7–8): for an analysis of how different supply-side policies would work and some attempt to explain why they would be the most appropriate strategy to solve structural unemployment. Max 7 if no conclusion L2 (5–6): for an answer that identifies a range of alternative supply-side policies but does not explain how these policies would work to solve the particular problem of structural unemployment, and no comparison or conclusion L1 (1–4): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

        Question: Discuss what determines the level of savings in an economy and assess the impact of an increase in the level of savings upon economic growth and employment. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Discuss what determines the level of savings in an economy and assess the impact of an increase in the level of savings upon economic growth and employment. [13],"b
Discuss what determines the level of savings in an economy and assess the impact of an increase in the level of savings upon economic growth and employment.The level of savings in an economy will be determined by a number of factors, including income levels; rate of interest on savings; expectations of changes in inflation; expectations relating to employment and economic growth; attitudes to thrift; availability of government savings schemes. Some attempt should be made to discuss relative importance of an increase in the level of savings and growth and employment.The impact of an increase upon key macroeconomic indicators such as growth and employment, should be discussed. Different models might be used to assess the impact of an increase in savings. For example, a circular flow model using withdrawals and injections could be used in conjunction with appropriate diagrams to illustrate the potential impact of an increase in savings on the level of employment. Discussion relating to the extent of the impact should be provided and supported by a relevant conclusion. L4 (9–13 marks): For a discussion that analyses at least two determinants of the level of savings in an economy plus evaluative comment which discusses the relative importance of these factors. Further analysis should be provided to link these determinants to growth and employment. An assessment of the strength of the impact in both cases should be made and supported by a conclusion. L3 (7–8 marks): For a less detailed analysis of one determinant with limited development that recognises and analyses the impact of this determinant on either growth or employment. However, there will be only a limited attempt to assess the impact of this change on the chosen macroeconomic indicator. L2 (5–6 marks): For a limited but descriptive explanation of some factors which might influence savings. Basic comment will be made linking savings and growth/employment but no analytical/discursive comment will be provided. L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: Discuss, with the aid of a diagram, whether it is possible for a trades union to increase its members' wage rate without reducing the level of employment. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ","Discuss, with the aid of a diagram, whether it is possible for a trades union to increase its members' wage rate without reducing the level of employment. [13]","b
Existence of a trades union implies an imperfect market. Explanation of the analysis of imperfect labour market, with MRP diagram and the imposition of a wage level agreed by a TU. Outcome would depend on where the wage rate is fixed. It is presumed that the wage rate would be higher than that obtained in the market. It could result in a reduction in employment or a constant employment with a higher wage, or both an increase in employment and wage. A diagram should be used. L4 (9–13 marks) for an sound clear explanation, clear diagram, and a discussion about the various alternatives of the fixed wage. L3 (7–8 marks) for a less competent analysis of the analysis and a discussion of only one likely outcome. Diagram may have a small error in it. L2 (5–6 marks) for a very brief explanation of the analysis, more inaccurate diagram, and little discussion of the outcome. L1 (1–4 marks) for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments  deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims? [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments  deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims? [13],"b

To what extent do you agree that it is not possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic aims?
Candidates should explain what is meant by a persistent balance of payments deficit. Some emphasis should be upon the importance of the word ‘persistent’. Alternative ways of solving a balance of payments deficit should be considered. Expenditure reducing, expenditure switching and direct intervention should then be discussed in the light of how these policies might impact on other macroeconomic aims. For example, an expenditure reducing policy based on raising interest rates, might have a negative effect on investment, economic growth and employment but a positive effect on inflation.
Some attempt to address the specific question, based on the preceding analysis should then be part of a reasoned conclusion.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an answer which explains the potential impact of a persistent balance of payments. Candidates should then consider at least two potential problems relating policy decisions to other key macroeconomic goals. A conclusion should make some attempt to decide the extent to which it is possible to solve a persistent balance of payments deficit without sacrificing other key macroeconomic goals.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an analysis which explains alternative policies available to address a persistent balance of payments deficit. Candidates should recognize at least one potential problem relating to the type of policy adopted to solve the balance of payments deficit. Also, there should be reference to, and an analysis of, the need to sacrifice at least one other macroeconomic goal.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a less well-developed comment which describes the problem and alternative policy prescriptions but does not attempt to identify and analyse why these policies might mean that other macroeconomic goals have to be sacrificed.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

        Question: Assess the view that supply-side policies are the most effective way to solve the problem of structural unemployment. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Assess the view that supply-side policies are the most effective way to solve the problem of structural unemployment. [13],"b
Supply side polices are government policies that attempt to alter the level of aggregate supply directly rather than through changes in aggregate demand. They can be market oriented or through direct government intervention. Interventionist policies might include: education and training. Market policies might include taxation; reduction in unemployment benefits – these policies would aim to increase labour geographical/occupation mobility and enable specific focus on unemployment caused by changes in the pattern of demand. Alternative policies such as Keynesian demand management policies would not be suitable because they would lack focus and may cause problems in those areas which are not experiencing high unemployment. However, supply-side policies often take a long time and they are frequently costly. L4 (9–13): for a discussion of the extent of the effectiveness of supply-side polices with some attempt to compare alternative demand management policies and some attempt to identify potential problems such as, the long time period needed for success or the high cost of intervention. There should be a conclusion. L3 (7–8): for an analysis of how different supply-side policies would work and some attempt to explain why they would be the most appropriate strategy to solve structural unemployment. Max 7 if no conclusion L2 (5–6): for an answer that identifies a range of alternative supply-side policies but does not explain how these policies would work to solve the particular problem of structural unemployment, and no comparison or conclusion L1 (1–4): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicate that the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

        Question: Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market. [13],"b

Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Answers should clearly identify and explain the key assumptions which explain the difference between these two labour markets. A monopsony market will consist of a single employer of labour; as a result the supply of labour to the firm will be upward sloping to the right. A profit maximising monopsonist employer will employ labour up to the point where the marginal cost of employing labour is equal to the marginal productivity of labour. A firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market will pay a wage determined by the market as a whole. The firm will be a wage taker and the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at the given wage.
Supporting diagrams in each case should clarify this difference. An increase in labour productivity would be reflected by an increase in the marginal physical product and therefore an increase in the marginal product of labour. In both market situations this would lead to a shift to the right of the firms MRP curve which is equivalent to an increase in the demand for labour. The impact in the case of monopsony will depend upon the extent of the increase in productivity. In a monopsony market, a significant increase in productivity will lead to a relatively higher increase in wages and employment but the extent of these changes will also be determined to some extent by the marginal cost of employing additional labour. In a perfectly competitive market, an increase in productivity will increase the demand for labour but the wage rate will remain the same.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of the difference between monopsony and a perfectly competitive labour market and a detailed analysis of the relationship between an increase in productivity, change in MRP and change in demand for labour. This analysis will then be applied to both markets and the respective impact of these changes on wages and employment in both markets will be compared.
L3 (7–8 marks): For competent analysis which clearly distinguishes between the two types of market and understands the relationship between changes in productivity, MRP and the demand for labour. An attempt should be made to compare the impact on wages and employment in both markets but the analysis will not be fully developed.
L2 (5–6 marks): For a brief and less clearly established link between labour productivity, MRP and the demand for labour. Some knowledge of the differences between the two types of labour market but only a very limited attempt to analyse the impact on one of the markets.
L1 (1–4 marks): For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

        Question: In 2016, a union representing doctors organised strikes to oppose new contracts and rates of pay that were proposed by the government. Hospital appointments were cancelled.The government agreed to change some of the proposals.Does this statement prove that in imperfect labour markets wages are determined solely by trade unions and not by economic principles?

The analysis of imperfect competition should be explained; the final wage can beincorporated in the theory depending on the strengths of both sides in thebargaining process where there is monopsony. In the case of the doctors the TUdid have some influence and the final wage was a compromise. This can be recognised by the theory and is not contradictory to it.L4 (9–13 marks): for a reasoned and clear explanation with accurate developmentof theoretical difficulties and a recognition that the final wage can be incorporatedin the theory.L3 (7–8 marks): for a clear but undeveloped explanation of the imperfectly competitive market but without an explicit comment on the case in the question.L2 (5–6 marks): for a limited and not clearly presented attempt to consider thetheory and with a greater concentration on the descriptive elements and with no link to the case in the question.L1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicatethat the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

        Question: discuss how this equilibrium might be affected by a government fiscal policy that raises taxes on goods. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",discuss how this equilibrium might be affected by a government fiscal policy that raises taxes on goods. [13],"b
Taxes on goods would be likely to raise the price. A price rise of one or more goods is reflected in a change in the budget line (pivot from point on axis of good with no price change) with a subsequent change in equilibrium. The equilibrium change involves substitution and income effects. Substitution effect would be in the opposite direction to the price change. The income effect represented by a parallel shift of the budget line is in the same direction as the substitution effect for the normal good but in the opposite direction as the substitution effect for the inferior good. Candidates may analyse the effect of tax changes on the price of two goods.L4 (9–13) For a reasoned and clear discussion, logically presented dealing with income, substitution effects, normal, inferior goods. L3 (7–8) For a fair but undeveloped discussion probably concentrating on income, substitution effects without mentioning different types of goods or vv with either a brief comment about the individual demand curve or no discussion about the market demand curve. L2 (5–6) For a limited discussion with a lack of development of both income/substitution and normal/inferior goods. L1 (1–4) For an answer which has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

             - You will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.
             - This should be at the very end of your essay.
             - Use conditional language (""This depends on..."", ""However, if..."") for each point. 
             - Offer a conclusion combining all the evauation points.

        Diagrams
        - If your answer needs to reference a diagram:
            - Indicate this via the text (DIAGRAM: (description of what the diagram is showing)).
            - Reference and explain key elements (e.g., ""As shown in the monopoly diagram, profit maximization at MR=MC leads to a deadweight loss triangle ABC"").
            - Link to analysis (e.g., ""The shift from S1 to S2 in the supply diagram illustrates how subsidies reduce production costs"").

        Non-Negotiable
        - DO NOT generate any headings, bold text or formatting. Generate your text in plain prose.
        - DO NOT include any real-world examples in your answer. Economic analysis only.          
        - Your explanation paragraphs combined should at least be two times longer than your evaluation, if the question asks for it. Expand on the analysis points from the mark scheme more than on evaluation.             
        - Your response will be approximately 750 words.


        Question: In 2016, a union representing doctors organised strikes to oppose new contracts and rates of pay that were proposed by the government. Hospital appointments were cancelled.The government agreed to change some of the proposals.Does this statement prove that in imperfect labour markets wages are determined solely by trade unions and not by economic principles? [13]

The analysis of imperfect competition should be explained; the final wage can beincorporated in the theory depending on the strengths of both sides in thebargaining process where there is monopsony. In the case of the doctors the TUdid have some influence and the final wage was a compromise. This can be recognised by the theory and is not contradictory to it.L4 (9–13 marks): for a reasoned and clear explanation with accurate developmentof theoretical difficulties and a recognition that the final wage can be incorporatedin the theory.L3 (7–8 marks): for a clear but undeveloped explanation of the imperfectly competitive market but without an explicit comment on the case in the question.L2 (5–6 marks): for a limited and not clearly presented attempt to consider thetheory and with a greater concentration on the descriptive elements and with no link to the case in the question.L1 (1–4 marks): for an answer that shows some knowledge but does not indicatethat the question has been fully grasped or where the answer is mostly irrelevant.

        You are an A-Level economics teacher with full knowledge of the A-Level syllabus. You will be given an 13-mark **A-Level** (not AS-Level) structured question. Generate responses in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        
        Formatting & Structure
        1. Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2. Stick to economic theory - do not reference real-world examples. Your answer should be something a top-scoring student would write in an actual exam.
        3. Your essay should follow this structure:
        - The question will usually ask you to ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" an economic statement statement, or ask you whether you ""agree or disagree"".
        - This requires an answer in two parts. Aim to reach roughly 750 words total.
        - If the question is purely explanatory (no ""Consider"" or ""Discuss"" or ""agree or disagree"" or ""evaluate""), then:
            - You will be asked to explain an economic statement. Think of all the points you will need to explain first to properly explain that statement.
            - For example, ""The existing equilibrium level of income, output and employment should be identified and explained.""
            - Your task is to elaborate on each of these sub-points using as much economic detail as possible. 
            - For each of these points, you will need to:
                - Define and explain the keywords in the point, e.g. ""Collusion refers to agreements between firms to fix prices, usually above the market equilibrium in an oligopoly market. This can be in the form of tacit collusion, which does not involve formal agreements, or in the form of a formal agreement and the formation of a cartel.""
                - Explain the point with a cause-and-effect chain if applicable (""Firms may choose to collude because of the Prisoner's Dilemma innate in an oligopoly. If a firm sets its price high, all other firms will set their prices low and the firm setting high prices will lose out on all its consumers; this results in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium and firms can counteract this by agreeing to set prices high together."")
        - If the question countains an evaluation part (""And consider whether..."", ""Discuss..."", ""Evaluate..."", mark scheme mentioning an ""evaluation""):
             - Follow all of the above for the explanation part.
             - You will need to write a paragraph that evaluates the statement in the question, i.e. consider several factors which may affect whether the statement is true.
             - Points may include: the time period in question, or the type of good, or the current state of the economy (recession or not), or the budget position of the governments, etc.
             - You will only need to offer 3 to 4 evaluation points plus a conclusion that combines all the points. However, please elaborate on each of the points and explain them in depth with full chains of analysis, as above.

        Question: Discuss whether the calculation of a marginal cost or an average cost is more significant in reaching conclusions about economic efficiency. [13]

        Question Type: Structured, A-Level, 13 marks
        ",Discuss whether the calculation of a marginal cost or an average cost is more significant in reaching conclusions about economic efficiency. [13],"b
Social efficiency/allocative efficiency requires that marginal social costs and marginal social benefits are equal at the point of output. For productive efficiency to occur the firm is producing at its lowest average cost for the output concerned. (Not necessarily the lowest overall average cost). L4 (9–13): for an understanding of the link of marginal to allocative efficiency and average to productive efficiency with a conclusion L3 (7–8): for a less accurate understanding – probably evidenced by a weak conclusion of the role of marginal and average in the different efficiencies L2 (5–6): for an unclear answer or one which concentrates on one of the efficiencies L1 (1–4): for an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory

        Instructions: 
        You are an A-Level economics teacher. You will be given an A-Level data response question, which includes an economics article or extract and a question concerning it. Generate responses to data-response questions in continuous prose (no headings, bullets, or markdown). Follow these rules strictly:
        Formatting & Structure
        1.	Never use bullets, lists, or headings—write in plain paragraphs.
        2.	Match length to marks:
        •	2-3 marks: 1–2 sentences (direct answer, no analysis).
        •	4-5 marks: 1–2 paragraphs (explain concepts + 1-2 article quotes).
        •	6-8 marks: 3–4 paragraphs (analyze both sides, use theory + evidence).
        •   Questions asking to ""state"": simple statement of point.
        •   Questions asking to ""explain"": 1 statement of a point + an explanation of that point based on A-Level economics knowledge.
        •   Questions asking to ""consider"", ""discuss"", or ""assess"": full analysis of valid points on both sides of the argument + conclusion that reaches a final judgement.
        Theory & Article Integration
        1.	Name and explain syllabus concepts (e.g., “Monopolies restrict output due to their downward-sloping AR curve, leading to allocative inefficiency where P > MC”).
        2.	Quote the article directly, if asked to do so in the question (e.g., “The ‘US$68 billion profits’ reflect supernormal profits”).
        3.	Reference diagrams in text (e.g., “In a negative externality diagram, MSC lies above MPC”).
        4.  You should quote the article whenever necessary, but ensure that if the question does not ask you about the article, focus predominantly on economic theory.
        High-Mark Elaboration (6-8 marks)
        For every theoretical claim, include:
        1.	Cause: “X occurs because...” (e.g., “Prices rise because monopolies set output where MR=MC”).

        Question: Economic recovery painsSince the world financial crisis of 2008 the United Kingdom (UK) economy has recovered more quickly than some other advanced economies but the recovery has been uneven.In 2010 the UK government aimed to reduce a huge government debt by cutting government expenditure and by increasing economic growth through encouraging more private sector activity.By 2014 total unemployment in the UK fell below two million for the first time since 2008. This economic recovery was due especially to an increase in jobs in the private sector, mainly in service industries. This increase outweighed the loss of jobs, such as hospital workers, in the public sector. A government spokesperson said 'every job created is a family made more secure and a step towards a stronger economy.'Monetary policy was also aimed at economic recovery. The central bank fixed interest rates at their lowest ever level of 0.5%. It expanded the money supply through quantitative easing.To do so the central bank purchased huge quantities of government bonds to increase liquidity in the economy through the commercial banking system.However, some critics of the government's macroeconomic aims were of the opinion that recovery in the economy was uneven. In 2014 only the services sector output exceeded its pre-2008 peak. Industrial production, construction and agriculture each failed to reach pre-2008 levels of output.Further, for UK households, there was a reduction in real household incomes and, although unemployment decreased, UK households faced a fall in living standards. Households feared that interest rates would rise and they were also wary that inflation could fall further and there might be deflation. Businesses were concerned that their main export markets in Europe would decline if the UK pound (£) continued to strengthen against the euro due to the UK's relatively stronger economic growth.Table 1 Selected UK economic indicators for 2008 and 2014

        Question: The effects of European Union (EU) labour migration
In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.
A critic of this free movement of labour stated that ""It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages.""
In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported ""There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services. Wages may have been affected for low-skilled workers but only marginally downward.""
Other economists have argued that, in theory, ""the impacts of immigration on wages and employment critically depends on whether migrants' skills are complements to, or substitutes for, the skills of existing workers. These impacts vary between the short run and long run. In the short run if the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages. If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in wages of existing workers. In the long run the economy can adjust to the increase in labour supply.""
Some governments have introduced a minimum wage to help those workers on low pay. The wage is set to increase to match any increase in inflation.

With the help of information in the article assess whether the increasing numbers of migrant workers are an advantage or a disadvantage to the receiving country.
Positive effects

skills of migrant workers can complement those domestic workers and increase productivity and therefore increase economic growth
earnings of migrant workers can create jobs – multiplier effect – increase in AD
without migrant workers the level of AS could not meet AD causing inflation
migrants fill jobs where there are labour shortages
research shows migrant workers make a positive contribution to the taxes which is higher than payments for welfare and public services spent on migrants.

Negative effects

EU workers have taken to jobs of domestic workers increasing unemployment
Increased competition for jobs drives down wages with a loss of government tax revenues
EU workers willing to accept lower wages, causing industrial unrest.

Come to some overall conclusion = 1 mark

        Question: Competition, monopoly and the market
Firms are sometimes thought of as machines: inputs go in, products come out. However, it matters how powerful these firms are allowed to become.
Competition law – the law that governs how firms compete in the market, how they may exert their power and how and when they may join forces – has not prevented high concentration ratios in many industries.
Global monopolies have been created in the name of ‘free market’ capitalism. Mergers have been approved and monopolies tolerated under the assumption that they are efficient. Their ability to enable innovation is relied upon to justify these monopolised industries.
Competition law is being used to protect a narrow set of public interests based on the idea of ‘consumer welfare’. The test applied by the law is whether any change will result in lower prices for consumers and thus is beneficial. This is regardless of how monopolised the resulting market structure becomes.
The logic that focuses on consumer prices is flawed. This can be seen in the impacts of firms on the environment. Prices do not capture the negative externalities of production, for which neither the producer nor the consumer pays. 
Low consumer prices are not an adequate indicator for consumer welfare. The low price/low wage spiral keeps pushing for cheaper goods and services to increase the profitability of the firm. The result is that workers are paid less. Low prices cause unequal bargaining positions between powerful employers and workers, and between powerful buyers and small independent suppliers.
Regulation has a role to play in protecting consumers from the worst abuses of market power by firms. There needs, however, to be new competition law that promotes the free market rather than the desires of the monopoly firms. It needs to consider the balance of power between the public sector and private enterprise.

        Question: Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

        Question: Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.



Discuss, with the use of AD/AS diagrams, how Russia and Saudi Arabia are likely to be able to respond to the fall in oil prices. [8]

        Question: Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

        Question: Economic decline in 2020
In 2020, Japan suffered its third quarterly decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in a row. The size of its real GDP shrank to its lowest level since 2011 when the country was suffering from 20 years of deflation and economic stagnation. In 2020, the economy was not helped by a previous increase in sales tax, the COVID-19 pandemic and the trade war between the world's biggest economies, the United States (US) and China. They were Japan's two most significant trading partners; 19.9% of exports went to the US and 19% to China. Table 1.1 gives some economic indicators for Japan for selected years.

In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the global economy was facing its worst recession since the world depression in the 1930s. Japan's economy shrank by 7.8% between April and June of 2020, while the US economy contracted by 9.5% and China's by 3.2%.
Japan, which was the world's fourth largest exporter, incurred an overall trade deficit of US$15.2 billion for 2019, an increase of almost 50% on the trade deficit for 2018. In 2020, exports fell by a further 18.5% in the third quarter, mainly caused by a decline in Japan's motor vehicle exports. In that quarter, its main car producer, one of the world's biggest car companies, made its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as sales halved. 
The government of Japan used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to try to stimulate the economy. Low interest rates had been used by the central bank since 2016. In August 2020, economists said that despite this stimulus to encourage growth there was a chance economic activity may stagnate even further if major nations again adopted more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to combat any reoccurrence of the pandemic.

In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)
In theory the low interest rates should discourage saving and increased consumption but the pattern of retail sales seems to contradict this expectation. (2)
Also, low interest rates should encourage borrowing for industrial investment to expand capital assets but industrial production has declined significantly after 2017 (2)
Policy appears to have worked best in 2017 when industrial production and retail sales improved significantly linked to the highest rate of economic growth year-on-year.
However the fall in exports, trade wars (US − China) and high levels of public debt have continued to lead to more stagnation. This has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 (2)

        Question: Pakistan and the Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI)
The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.
Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.
Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.
The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).

        Question: Economic decline in 2020
In 2020, Japan suffered its third quarterly decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in a row. The size of its real GDP shrank to its lowest level since 2011 when the country was suffering from 20 years of deflation and economic stagnation. In 2020, the economy was not helped by a previous increase in sales tax, the COVID-19 pandemic and the trade war between the world's biggest economies, the United States (US) and China. They were Japan's two most significant trading partners; 19.9% of exports went to the US and 19% to China. Table 1.1 gives some economic indicators for Japan for selected years.

In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the global economy was facing its worst recession since the world depression in the 1930s. Japan's economy shrank by 7.8% between April and June of 2020, while the US economy contracted by 9.5% and China's by 3.2%.
Japan, which was the world's fourth largest exporter, incurred an overall trade deficit of US$15.2 billion for 2019, an increase of almost 50% on the trade deficit for 2018. In 2020, exports fell by a further 18.5% in the third quarter, mainly caused by a decline in Japan's motor vehicle exports. In that quarter, its main car producer, one of the world's biggest car companies, made its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as sales halved. 
The government of Japan used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to try to stimulate the economy. Low interest rates had been used by the central bank since 2016. In August 2020, economists said that despite this stimulus to encourage growth there was a chance economic activity may stagnate even further if major nations again adopted more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to combat any reoccurrence of the pandemic.

In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)
In theory the low interest rates should discourage saving and increased consumption but the pattern of retail sales seems to contradict this expectation. (2)
Also, low interest rates should encourage borrowing for industrial investment to expand capital assets but industrial production has declined significantly after 2017 (2)
Policy appears to have worked best in 2017 when industrial production and retail sales improved significantly linked to the highest rate of economic growth year-on-year.
However the fall in exports, trade wars (US − China) and high levels of public debt have continued to lead to more stagnation. This has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 (2)

        Question: Competition in passenger aircraft manufacturing  
Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.
The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.
In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.
Recent competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry has aimed at improving fuel efficiency, developing longer non-stop flying ranges and developing very large aircraft with a capacity of 500 passengers. The companies have been successful in achieving the first two aims. 
The third aim of developing very large aircraft was intended to move larger numbers of passengers between 'hub' airports, where they would transfer to smaller aircraft for onwards transport to regional airports. Whilst it has achieved increased passenger capacity, this development has not been a success for the airlines that bought these very large aircraft. The need for these was undermined by the success of the first two competitive developments. 
The nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry is that it involves significant fixed costs. The research and development (R&D) costs of a new aircraft can rise to US$26 billion.
Currently the two companies are concerned that China, in its drive to increase the value of its exports, will enter the aircraft manufacturing industry in the next 10 to 15 years and add a new level of competition.

        Question: Problems in the steel industry
By 2016, China’s steel industry had expanded rapidly and accounted for just over half of world production but China’s economy had huge excess capacity: 30% in the case of steel which led to cheap export prices. Chinese economic growth in real terms was slowing and aggregate supply was greater than aggregate demand. Profit margins were already small but the collapse of world steel prices which fell significantly in 2015 (as shown in Fig. 1.1) worsened the situation.
The dumping of cheap Chinese imports of steel caused problems for the United Kingdom (UK) steel industry. There were thousands of job losses at three major steel factories which was devastating news for UK steel workers and the regional economies.
Some argued that despite this there was no case for the UK Government to intervene to save the steel factories.
Steel is used in the construction industry and in the production of cars, household appliances and many other goods. Companies that use steel are much more numerous than companies that produce it. If steel prices are low, the costs of companies that use steel are reduced. So there should be no complaints or pleas for government intervention about supposedly unfair competition from cut-price imports.
Industrial policy is a valid aim of government when it comes to identifying market failures. There iseven a strong case for rescuing industries that face temporary external shocks, such as occurred with the United States (US) Government’s rescue of Chrysler and General Motors in 2008 as the economy fell into deep recession. For steel, however, it is a buyers’ market. The closure of unprofitable steel factories is not a market failure at all. It is a reflection of costs being too high and the industry being uncompetitive. Rescuing steel factories with public money would do nothing to alleviate the problem of overcapacity. It would divert scarce resources from more productive uses such as long term investment in infrastructure.

Explain what is meant by market failure. Discuss whether there is any evidence in the information that the government should support the steel industry because there is market failure.     [8]","1(d)

Market failure: inefficient allocation of resources – maybe due to monopoly, information failure, externalities or need for public goods. (1–2)
The case for intervention is based on the need to preserve jobs and help sustain the local economy near steel plants. In the short run the government could subsidise production until such time as world demand increases and prices of steel rise (temporary external shocks);
The danger of foreign suppliers that undercut UK steel prices is not really a case of market failure but market forces working. Local industry costs are too high; industry uncompetitive. However, if there is ‘dumping’ then it can be a market failure.
Government may fear future increase in prices leaving UK economy vulnerable to dependence on foreign steel and wish to support home industry. This is not a case of market failure.
Also, if the steel industry is a high cost industry with overcapacity it could be unsustainable in the long run. If supported it would require public funds which would mean less spent on other projects. No real evidence for improved efficiency from this. Not really market failure.

        Question: The threat from large firms
In 2021, one of the largest United States (US) technology companies averaged sales of US$1.2 billion a day. It took less than four seconds to earn US$52000, the average American yearly salary. Three of the largest technology companies reported record breaking sales and profits. Five of the largest companies made combined profits of over US$68 billion. 
They were helped by the Covid-19 pandemic that caused a huge increase in online working and shopping. The ability to work and shop online was greatly welcomed by many who were forced to stay at home.
Critics, however, worry that if this trend to large firms continues the future will be controlled by a handful of super-rich, super-powerful companies. They will dominate economic activity. This is not just bad for the economy; it is bad for consumers and bad for competition. Also, economic concentration causes unacceptable inequality. One powerful firm tried to prevent workers joining a trade union.
Their huge cash reserves mean that they could undercut possible new entrants and prevent competition. Investors will be wary of investing in possible competitors and new owners would be prepared to sell out to the dominant firms rather than try and compete.
The size of the firm gives it political power to fight any official or government intervention. Governments are beginning to be aware of this.

        ","The threat from large firms
In 2021, one of the largest United States (US) technology companies averaged sales of US$1.2 billion a day. It took less than four seconds to earn US$52000, the average American yearly salary. Three of the largest technology companies reported record breaking sales and profits. Five of the largest companies made combined profits of over US$68 billion. 
They were helped by the Covid-19 pandemic that caused a huge increase in online working and shopping. The ability to work and shop online was greatly welcomed by many who were forced to stay at home.
Critics, however, worry that if this trend to large firms continues the future will be controlled by a handful of super-rich, super-powerful companies. They will dominate economic activity. This is not just bad for the economy; it is bad for consumers and bad for competition. Also, economic concentration causes unacceptable inequality. One powerful firm tried to prevent workers joining a trade union.
Their huge cash reserves mean that they could undercut possible new entrants and prevent competition. Investors will be wary of investing in possible competitors and new owners would be prepared to sell out to the dominant firms rather than try and compete.
The size of the firm gives it political power to fight any official or government intervention. Governments are beginning to be aware of this. The chair of the US body that deals with competition law said there was a range of potential risks created by the large companies. The government is aware of their ability to avoid paying taxes and their ability to dominate allows them to expand into markets for similar products.

The article says the growth of large firms is bad for consumers, bad for competition, and causes inequality.
Consider whether this statement can be supported by the article or by economic theory.
In support: Article mentions profit compared with salaries, restriction on union membership, avoidance of tax, expansion into adjacent markets.
Theory: Growth of firms can lead to less choice, higher prices, restricted output, higher profits. This is supported by the article and by theory. It can be detrimental for consumers and detrimental for competition. Monopolies can be formed, small firms forced out of the market. (4 marks for support)
Against the statement: Article mentions consumers working/staying at home and welcoming the service the firms provide.
Theory: Large firms can also have economies of scale, can reduce prices, can encourage innovation and research. This is not mentioned in the article but is supported by economic theory. (4 marks for against the statement)
Conclusion: statement is not therefore always true. (1 mark)

        Question: Economic decline in 2020
In 2020, Japan suffered its third quarterly decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in a row. The size of its real GDP shrank to its lowest level since 2011 when the country was suffering from 20 years of deflation and economic stagnation. In 2020, the economy was not helped by a previous increase in sales tax, the COVID-19 pandemic and the trade war between the world's biggest economies, the United States (US) and China. They were Japan's two most significant trading partners; 19.9% of exports went to the US and 19% to China. Table 1.1 gives some economic indicators for Japan for selected years.

In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the global economy was facing its worst recession since the world depression in the 1930s. Japan's economy shrank by 7.8% between April and June of 2020, while the US economy contracted by 9.5% and China's by 3.2%.
Japan, which was the world's fourth largest exporter, incurred an overall trade deficit of US$15.2 billion for 2019, an increase of almost 50% on the trade deficit for 2018. In 2020, exports fell by a further 18.5% in the third quarter, mainly caused by a decline in Japan's motor vehicle exports. In that quarter, its main car producer, one of the world's biggest car companies, made its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as sales halved. 
The government of Japan used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to try to stimulate the economy. Low interest rates had been used by the central bank since 2016. In August 2020, economists said that despite this stimulus to encourage growth there was a chance economic activity may stagnate even further if major nations again adopted more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to combat any reoccurrence of the pandemic.

In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)
In theory the low interest rates should discourage saving and increased consumption but the pattern of retail sales seems to contradict this expectation. (2)
Also, low interest rates should encourage borrowing for industrial investment to expand capital assets but industrial production has declined significantly after 2017 (2)
Policy appears to have worked best in 2017 when industrial production and retail sales improved significantly linked to the highest rate of economic growth year-on-year.
However the fall in exports, trade wars (US − China) and high levels of public debt have continued to lead to more stagnation. This has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 (2)

        Question: The effects of European Union (EU) labour migration
In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.
A critic of this free movement of labour stated that ""It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages.""
In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported ""There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services. Wages may have been affected for low-skilled workers but only marginally downward.""
Other economists have argued that, in theory, ""the impacts of immigration on wages and employment critically depends on whether migrants' skills are complements to, or substitutes for, the skills of existing workers. These impacts vary between the short run and long run. In the short run if the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages. If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in wages of existing workers. In the long run the economy can adjust to the increase in labour supply.""
Some governments have introduced a minimum wage to help those workers on low pay. The wage is set to increase to match any increase in inflation.

With the help of information in the article assess whether the increasing numbers of migrant workers are an advantage or a disadvantage to the receiving country.
Positive effects

skills of migrant workers can complement those domestic workers and increase productivity and therefore increase economic growth
earnings of migrant workers can create jobs – multiplier effect – increase in AD
without migrant workers the level of AS could not meet AD causing inflation
migrants fill jobs where there are labour shortages
research shows migrant workers make a positive contribution to the taxes which is higher than payments for welfare and public services spent on migrants.

Negative effects

EU workers have taken to jobs of domestic workers increasing unemployment
Increased competition for jobs drives down wages with a loss of government tax revenues
EU workers willing to accept lower wages, causing industrial unrest.

        Question: French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

Consider whether the actions of the French government on electricity prices might be thought to increase either equality or equity for consumers and producers.
Cannot show that changes in price are linked to any notion of fairness, in relation to producer (1). Therefore, producer equity will be unaffected (1). A tax cut might increase consumer equity (1). Explanation (1) equality possibly, consumer rescued from excessive price increase (1) but as both rich and poor consumer benefit it is not conclusive that consumer equality is improved (1). Small firms will get cheaper electricity at the expense of large firms and this suggests an increase in equality between producers might be obtained (2). However, a cut in electricity taxes might benefit the large electricity company more than its smaller rivals, therefore any conclusion on the impact of equality for producers might remain uncertain (2).

        Question: Productivity in the G7 countries
The G7 is a group of countries that have some of the world's major advanced economies. Productivity in the G7 countries varies, as shown in Fig. 1.1 below, with United Kingdom (UK) performance as the base index of 100.

Fig. 1.1: Gross domestic product per hour worked, G7 countries, for 2015 and 2016
Productivity in the UK was one of the worst in the G7. Poor management practices and lower levels of skills in the workforce were the main reasons for the UK’s position. In low wage, high employment sectors of the UK economy, the performance compared unfavourably with five of the G7 countries. In retailing, the UK was 40% lower than the performance in the United States (US). In hospitality industries the UK had a 45% lower rate than France.
Tackling poor productivity is about innovation, investment and improving infrastructure as well as labour skills.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the US suggested that innovation is one of the keys to productivity differences among the G7 countries. Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.
In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.
There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK. This made some UK industries, such as car production, vulnerable. The central bank in the UK has stated that foreign owned car manufacturers in the UK invest heavily in R&D and their presence boosts the productivity of labour. It was thought this may change in the future.

Use the information to discuss whether or not it is likely that the UK's productivity within the G7 countries will improve.
Seems unlikely to improve in the short-term (1) because:

low levels of investment over a 20 year period (1)
R&D as a % of GNP is only 1.3% 7& well below some other G7 countries (1)
poor management practices and lower skills levels generally (1)
FDI balance–latest figures show foreign investment in UK is declining caused by economic uncertainties, e.g. car industry (1)

But there are some factors which may lead to improvement in the long term (1)

world-renowned R&D in digital technology and biomedical research (1)
increased government investment in transport infrastructure (1)

        Question: French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

Consider whether the actions of the French government on electricity prices might be thought to increase either equality or equity for consumers and producers.
Cannot show that changes in price are linked to any notion of fairness, in relation to producer (1). Therefore, producer equity will be unaffected (1). A tax cut might increase consumer equity (1). Explanation (1) equality possibly, consumer rescued from excessive price increase (1) but as both rich and poor consumer benefit it is not conclusive that consumer equality is improved (1). Small firms will get cheaper electricity at the expense of large firms and this suggests an increase in equality between producers might be obtained (2). However, a cut in electricity taxes might benefit the large electricity company more than its smaller rivals, therefore any conclusion on the impact of equality for producers might remain uncertain (2).

        Question: Economic recovery painsSince the world financial crisis of 2008 the United Kingdom (UK) economy has recovered more quickly than some other advanced economies but the recovery has been uneven.In 2010 the UK government aimed to reduce a huge government debt by cutting government expenditure and by increasing economic growth through encouraging more private sector activity.By 2014 total unemployment in the UK fell below two million for the first time since 2008. This economic recovery was due especially to an increase in jobs in the private sector, mainly in service industries. This increase outweighed the loss of jobs, such as hospital workers, in the public sector. A government spokesperson said 'every job created is a family made more secure and a step towards a stronger economy.'Monetary policy was also aimed at economic recovery. The central bank fixed interest rates at their lowest ever level of 0.5%. It expanded the money supply through quantitative easing.To do so the central bank purchased huge quantities of government bonds to increase liquidity in the economy through the commercial banking system.However, some critics of the government's macroeconomic aims were of the opinion that recovery in the economy was uneven. In 2014 only the services sector output exceeded its pre-2008 peak. Industrial production, construction and agriculture each failed to reach pre-2008 levels of output.Further, for UK households, there was a reduction in real household incomes and, although unemployment decreased, UK households faced a fall in living standards. Households feared that interest rates would rise and they were also wary that inflation could fall further and there might be deflation. Businesses were concerned that their main export markets in Europe would decline if the UK pound (£) continued to strengthen against the euro due to the UK's relatively stronger economic growth.Table 1 Selected UK economic indicators for 2008 and 2014

        Question: Productivity in the G7 countries
The G7 is a group of countries that have some of the world's major advanced economies. Productivity in the G7 countries varies, as shown in Fig. 1.1 below, with United Kingdom (UK) performance as the base index of 100.

Fig. 1.1: Gross domestic product per hour worked, G7 countries, for 2015 and 2016
Productivity in the UK was one of the worst in the G7. Poor management practices and lower levels of skills in the workforce were the main reasons for the UK’s position. In low wage, high employment sectors of the UK economy, the performance compared unfavourably with five of the G7 countries. In retailing, the UK was 40% lower than the performance in the United States (US). In hospitality industries the UK had a 45% lower rate than France.
Tackling poor productivity is about innovation, investment and improving infrastructure as well as labour skills.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the US suggested that innovation is one of the keys to productivity differences among the G7 countries. Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.
In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.
There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK. This made some UK industries, such as car production, vulnerable.

        ","Productivity in the G7 countries
The G7 is a group of countries that have some of the world's major advanced economies. Productivity in the G7 countries varies, as shown in Fig. 1.1 below, with United Kingdom (UK) performance as the base index of 100.

Fig. 1.1: Gross domestic product per hour worked, G7 countries, for 2015 and 2016
Productivity in the UK was one of the worst in the G7. Poor management practices and lower levels of skills in the workforce were the main reasons for the UK’s position. In low wage, high employment sectors of the UK economy, the performance compared unfavourably with five of the G7 countries. In retailing, the UK was 40% lower than the performance in the United States (US). In hospitality industries the UK had a 45% lower rate than France.
Tackling poor productivity is about innovation, investment and improving infrastructure as well as labour skills.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the US suggested that innovation is one of the keys to productivity differences among the G7 countries. Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.
In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.
There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK. This made some UK industries, such as car production, vulnerable. The central bank in the UK has stated that foreign owned car manufacturers in the UK invest heavily in R&D and their presence boosts the productivity of labour. It was thought this may change in the future.

Use the information to discuss whether or not it is likely that the UK's productivity within the G7 countries will improve.
Seems unlikely to improve in the short-term (1) because:

low levels of investment over a 20 year period (1)
R&D as a % of GNP is only 1.3% 7& well below some other G7 countries (1)
poor management practices and lower skills levels generally (1)
FDI balance–latest figures show foreign investment in UK is declining caused by economic uncertainties, e.g. car industry (1)

But there are some factors which may lead to improvement in the long term (1)

world-renowned R&D in digital technology and biomedical research (1)
increased government investment in transport infrastructure (1)

        Question: Competition in passenger aircraft manufacturing  
Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.
The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.
In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.
Recent competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry has aimed at improving fuel efficiency, developing longer non-stop flying ranges and developing very large aircraft with a capacity of 500 passengers. The companies have been successful in achieving the first two aims. 
The third aim of developing very large aircraft was intended to move larger numbers of passengers between 'hub' airports, where they would transfer to smaller aircraft for onwards transport to regional airports. Whilst it has achieved increased passenger capacity, this development has not been a success for the airlines that bought these very large aircraft. The need for these was undermined by the success of the first two competitive developments. 
The nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry is that it involves significant fixed costs. The research and development (R&D) costs of a new aircraft can rise to US$26 billion.
Currently the two companies are concerned that China, in its drive to increase the value of its exports, will enter the aircraft manufacturing industry in the next 10 to 15 years and add a new level of competition.

        Question: Problems in the steel industry
By 2016, China’s steel industry had expanded rapidly and accounted for just over half of world production but China’s economy had huge excess capacity: 30% in the case of steel which led to cheap export prices. Chinese economic growth in real terms was slowing and aggregate supply was greater than aggregate demand. Profit margins were already small but the collapse of world steel prices which fell significantly in 2015 (as shown in Fig. 1.1) worsened the situation.
The dumping of cheap Chinese imports of steel caused problems for the United Kingdom (UK) steel industry. There were thousands of job losses at three major steel factories which was devastating news for UK steel workers and the regional economies.
Some argued that despite this there was no case for the UK Government to intervene to save the steel factories.
Steel is used in the construction industry and in the production of cars, household appliances and many other goods. Companies that use steel are much more numerous than companies that produce it. If steel prices are low, the costs of companies that use steel are reduced. So there should be no complaints or pleas for government intervention about supposedly unfair competition from cut-price imports.
Industrial policy is a valid aim of government when it comes to identifying market failures. There iseven a strong case for rescuing industries that face temporary external shocks, such as occurred with the United States (US) Government’s rescue of Chrysler and General Motors in 2008 as the economy fell into deep recession. For steel, however, it is a buyers’ market. The closure of unprofitable steel factories is not a market failure at all. It is a reflection of costs being too high and the industry being uncompetitive. Rescuing steel factories with public money would do nothing to alleviate the problem of overcapacity. It would divert scarce resources from more productive uses such as long term investment in infrastructure.

Market failure: inefficient allocation of resources – maybe due to monopoly, information failure, externalities or need for public goods. (1–2)
The case for intervention is based on the need to preserve jobs and help sustain the local economy near steel plants. In the short run the government could subsidise production until such time as world demand increases and prices of steel rise (temporary external shocks);
The danger of foreign suppliers that undercut UK steel prices is not really a case of market failure but market forces working. Local industry costs are too high; industry uncompetitive. However, if there is ‘dumping’ then it can be a market failure.
Government may fear future increase in prices leaving UK economy vulnerable to dependence on foreign steel and wish to support home industry. This is not a case of market failure.
Also, if the steel industry is a high cost industry with overcapacity it could be unsustainable in the long run. If supported it would require public funds which would mean less spent on other projects. No real evidence for improved efficiency from this. Not really market failure.

        Question: Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.



Discuss, with the use of AD/AS diagrams, how Russia and Saudi Arabia are likely to be able to respond to the fall in oil prices. [8]

The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.

        ","Competition in passenger aircraft manufacturing  
Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.
The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.
In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.

        Question: Changes in the world oil market and their effects
Founded in 1960, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), consisted of five countries all of whom produced oil. OPEC's success, with Saudi Arabia as its market leader, encouraged other oil exporting countries to join. There are now 12 OPEC member countries, including Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC is responsible for over 35% of world oil production, working together to fix prices and control output.
OPEC has faced various external shocks. In recent years, the financial crisis 2008–2011 reduced global demand for oil. Also, since 2012, non-OPEC oil supplies have increased, as shown in Fig. 1, mainly due to the use of fracking – a process of extracting oil from rock using very expensive drilling equipment. This has happened in spite of opposition to fracking by environmentalists who accuse the fracking companies of causing minor earthquakes and polluting underground water sources.
The main oil producer using fracking is the United States (US) which has become almost self-sufficient in oil and consequently does not need to rely on OPEC. In 2014, the US even began to export its oil, especially to Europe as a rival to OPEC and Russia. This had an effect on the price of oil as shown on the chart in Fig. 2.
There have been both winners and losers from this change in production of oil. While all oil importing countries have become winners as the price of oil declines, undoubtedly the US has strengthened its economy the most. The fracking boom has increased consumer spending in the US, which has been a key element in the recovery of the US economy from the financial crisis.
The losers are OPEC's members that are dependent on oil as the main source of revenue. Nigeria greatly overestimated the price of oil and, as a result, it had to devalue its currency in November 2014, raise taxes on luxury items and cut government spending by 6%.

Despite the fall in oil prices, in January 2015 Saudi Arabia refused to agree to demands from other OPEC members to cut oil supplies in order to keep prices high. Saudi Arabia was happy to allow oil prices to fall further in order to put US fracking companies out of business.

Is there any evidence in the information that might lead to the conclusion that the US economy is a winner in the short run but could become a loser in the long run? [8]

Winner in the short-run:• It has reduced the dependence on OPEC's oil supplies – reduces imports – and has begun to export resulting in an improved balance of trade / BOP.• Increased earnings in the USA leading to increased consumption – multiplier effect – recovery from financial crisis.(Maximum 4 marks) Loser in the long-run:• Cost of fracking may become higher (very expensive equipment) so costs become greater than world oil price – hence Saudi Arabia wants to allow the price to fall further.• Opposition to fracking (negative externalities) environmental lobby tries to curb supplies.• US$ may become too strong if its economy strengthens leading to more expensive oil for importing countries and a possible loss of markets to rival suppliers in OPEC and Russia.(Maximum 4 marks)

        Question: Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

        Question: Productivity in the G7 countries
The G7 is a group of countries that have some of the world's major advanced economies. Productivity in the G7 countries varies, as shown in Fig. 1.1 below, with United Kingdom (UK) performance as the base index of 100.

Fig. 1.1: Gross domestic product per hour worked, G7 countries, for 2015 and 2016
Productivity in the UK was one of the worst in the G7. Poor management practices and lower levels of skills in the workforce were the main reasons for the UK’s position. In low wage, high employment sectors of the UK economy, the performance compared unfavourably with five of the G7 countries. In retailing, the UK was 40% lower than the performance in the United States (US). In hospitality industries the UK had a 45% lower rate than France.
Tackling poor productivity is about innovation, investment and improving infrastructure as well as labour skills.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the US suggested that innovation is one of the keys to productivity differences among the G7 countries. Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.
In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.
There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK. This made some UK industries, such as car production, vulnerable. The central bank in the UK has stated that foreign owned car manufacturers in the UK invest heavily in R&D and their presence boosts the productivity of labour. It was thought this may change in the future.

Use the information to discuss whether or not it is likely that the UK's productivity within the G7 countries will improve.
Seems unlikely to improve in the short-term (1) because:

low levels of investment over a 20 year period (1)
R&D as a % of GNP is only 1.3% 7& well below some other G7 countries (1)
poor management practices and lower skills levels generally (1)
FDI balance–latest figures show foreign investment in UK is declining caused by economic uncertainties, e.g. car industry (1)

But there are some factors which may lead to improvement in the long term (1)

world-renowned R&D in digital technology and biomedical research (1)
increased government investment in transport infrastructure (1)

        Question: Competition in passenger aircraft manufacturing  
Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.
The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.
In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.
Recent competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry has aimed at improving fuel efficiency, developing longer non-stop flying ranges and developing very large aircraft with a capacity of 500 passengers. The companies have been successful in achieving the first two aims. 
The third aim of developing very large aircraft was intended to move larger numbers of passengers between 'hub' airports, where they would transfer to smaller aircraft for onwards transport to regional airports. Whilst it has achieved increased passenger capacity, this development has not been a success for the airlines that bought these very large aircraft. The need for these was undermined by the success of the first two competitive developments. 
The nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry is that it involves significant fixed costs. The research and development (R&D) costs of a new aircraft can rise to US$26 billion.
Currently the two companies are concerned that China, in its drive to increase the value of its exports, will enter the aircraft manufacturing industry in the next 10 to 15 years and add a new level of competition.

        Question: Changes in the world oil market and their effects
Founded in 1960, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), consisted of five countries all of whom produced oil. OPEC's success, with Saudi Arabia as its market leader, encouraged other oil exporting countries to join. There are now 12 OPEC member countries, including Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC is responsible for over 35% of world oil production, working together to fix prices and control output.
OPEC has faced various external shocks. In recent years, the financial crisis 2008–2011 reduced global demand for oil. Also, since 2012, non-OPEC oil supplies have increased, as shown in Fig. 1, mainly due to the use of fracking – a process of extracting oil from rock using very expensive drilling equipment. This has happened in spite of opposition to fracking by environmentalists who accuse the fracking companies of causing minor earthquakes and polluting underground water sources.
The main oil producer using fracking is the United States (US) which has become almost self-sufficient in oil and consequently does not need to rely on OPEC. In 2014, the US even began to export its oil, especially to Europe as a rival to OPEC and Russia. This had an effect on the price of oil as shown on the chart in Fig. 2.
There have been both winners and losers from this change in production of oil. While all oil importing countries have become winners as the price of oil declines, undoubtedly the US has strengthened its economy the most. The fracking boom has increased consumer spending in the US, which has been a key element in the recovery of the US economy from the financial crisis.
The losers are OPEC's members that are dependent on oil as the main source of revenue. Nigeria greatly overestimated the price of oil and, as a result, it had to devalue its currency in November 2014, raise taxes on luxury items and cut government spending by 6%.

Despite the fall in oil prices, in January 2015 Saudi Arabia refused to agree to demands from other OPEC members to cut oil supplies in order to keep prices high. Saudi Arabia was happy to allow oil prices to fall further in order to put US fracking companies out of business.

Is there any evidence in the information that might lead to the conclusion that the US economy is a winner in the short run but could become a loser in the long run? [8]

Winner in the short-run:• It has reduced the dependence on OPEC's oil supplies – reduces imports – and has begun to export resulting in an improved balance of trade / BOP.• Increased earnings in the USA leading to increased consumption – multiplier effect – recovery from financial crisis.(Maximum 4 marks) Loser in the long-run:• Cost of fracking may become higher (very expensive equipment) so costs become greater than world oil price – hence Saudi Arabia wants to allow the price to fall further.• Opposition to fracking (negative externalities) environmental lobby tries to curb supplies.• US$ may become too strong if its economy strengthens leading to more expensive oil for importing countries and a possible loss of markets to rival suppliers in OPEC and Russia.(Maximum 4 marks)

        Question: Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

        Question: Pakistan and the Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI)
The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.
Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.
Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.
The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).

        Question: The effects of European Union (EU) labour migration
In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.
A critic of this free movement of labour stated that ""It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages.""
In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported ""There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services. Wages may have been affected for low-skilled workers but only marginally downward.""
Other economists have argued that, in theory, ""the impacts of immigration on wages and employment critically depends on whether migrants' skills are complements to, or substitutes for, the skills of existing workers. These impacts vary between the short run and long run. In the short run if the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages. If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in wages of existing workers. In the long run the economy can adjust to the increase in labour supply.""
Some governments have introduced a minimum wage to help those workers on low pay. The wage is set to increase to match any increase in inflation.

With the help of information in the article assess whether the increasing numbers of migrant workers are an advantage or a disadvantage to the receiving country.
Positive effects

skills of migrant workers can complement those domestic workers and increase productivity and therefore increase economic growth
earnings of migrant workers can create jobs – multiplier effect – increase in AD
without migrant workers the level of AS could not meet AD causing inflation
migrants fill jobs where there are labour shortages
research shows migrant workers make a positive contribution to the taxes which is higher than payments for welfare and public services spent on migrants.

Negative effects

EU workers have taken to jobs of domestic workers increasing unemployment
Increased competition for jobs drives down wages with a loss of government tax revenues
EU workers willing to accept lower wages, causing industrial unrest.

Come to some overall conclusion = 1 mark

        Question: Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.



Discuss, with the use of AD/AS diagrams, how Russia and Saudi Arabia are likely to be able to respond to the fall in oil prices. [8]

        Question: The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil
Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland. 
Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt. 
Nations producing palm oil view it as a means of reducing poverty, while international finance organisations regard it as an engine of growth for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) encouraged Malaysia and Indonesia to cultivate natural resources and to produce more palm oil in spite of an awareness of high external costs. Dutch banks provided more than US$12 billion in loans to Indonesian producers. Palm oil is Indonesia’s main export earner. 
Widespread adoption of palm oil began when, in 1995, one of the world's major multinational companies decided to use it in its global food manufacturing industries instead of animal fats and other vegetable oils, which were then said to be unhealthy. It invested heavily in expanding palm oil plantations in Malaysia and achieved considerable cost savings because palm oil has a much higher yield per hectare than other vegetable oils.
Palm oil's versatility is not limited to food. It is used in 70% of personal care products (toiletries) such as soap, shampoo and make-up. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel fuel.
As the palm oil industry expanded, conservationists began to raise the alarm about the devastating effects from carbon emissions and on wildlife habitats. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of some rare animals. 
In 2019, one supermarket promised to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. Norway banned imports for biodiesel production. The European Parliament proposed that public subsidies for biodiesel should be removed by 2021. If this proposal is enacted it will affect the demand for biodiesel and may force palm oil producing countries to reduce deforestation programmes, leading to improved environmental sustainability.
Fig. 1.1 illustrates the palm oil uses in Europe.

To what extent do you agree with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to encourage Indonesia to expand its production of palm oil?
In support of the advice: Indonesia was suffering from external debt problems and the IMF advocated expansion of a big earner of forex to eliminate this debt with positive outcomes for growth of incomes in-country. Plus any relevant positive effects identified. (4 max)
The disadvantage was the devastation of rain forests to increase land area for oil palms. Fires increase greenhouse gas emissions (global warming) and destroy habitats. External costs will exceed private costs of plantation owners. Danger of monoculture – prices influenced by foreign buyers – could result in job losses eventually if foreign trade is reduced. (4 max)
Conclusion: Although Europe may reduce its demand, increasing demands in India, China and Indonesia will be critical. Palm oil can be seen as both a positive benefit and a negative impact with a high social cost. Environmentally production is unsustainable at present rate of expansion. [1] (8 max total)

        Question: Changes in the world oil market and their effects
Founded in 1960, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), consisted of five countries all of whom produced oil. OPEC's success, with Saudi Arabia as its market leader, encouraged other oil exporting countries to join. There are now 12 OPEC member countries, including Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC is responsible for over 35% of world oil production, working together to fix prices and control output.
OPEC has faced various external shocks. In recent years, the financial crisis 2008–2011 reduced global demand for oil. Also, since 2012, non-OPEC oil supplies have increased, as shown in Fig. 1, mainly due to the use of fracking – a process of extracting oil from rock using very expensive drilling equipment. This has happened in spite of opposition to fracking by environmentalists who accuse the fracking companies of causing minor earthquakes and polluting underground water sources.
The main oil producer using fracking is the United States (US) which has become almost self-sufficient in oil and consequently does not need to rely on OPEC. In 2014, the US even began to export its oil, especially to Europe as a rival to OPEC and Russia. This had an effect on the price of oil as shown on the chart in Fig. 2.
There have been both winners and losers from this change in production of oil. While all oil importing countries have become winners as the price of oil declines, undoubtedly the US has strengthened its economy the most. The fracking boom has increased consumer spending in the US, which has been a key element in the recovery of the US economy from the financial crisis.
The losers are OPEC's members that are dependent on oil as the main source of revenue. Nigeria greatly overestimated the price of oil and, as a result, it had to devalue its currency in November 2014, raise taxes on luxury items and cut government spending by 6%.

Despite the fall in oil prices, in January 2015 Saudi Arabia refused to agree to demands from other OPEC members to cut oil supplies in order to keep prices high. Saudi Arabia was happy to allow oil prices to fall further in order to put US fracking companies out of business.

Is there any evidence in the information that might lead to the conclusion that the US economy is a winner in the short run but could become a loser in the long run? [8]

Winner in the short-run:• It has reduced the dependence on OPEC's oil supplies – reduces imports – and has begun to export resulting in an improved balance of trade / BOP.• Increased earnings in the USA leading to increased consumption – multiplier effect – recovery from financial crisis.(Maximum 4 marks) Loser in the long-run:• Cost of fracking may become higher (very expensive equipment) so costs become greater than world oil price – hence Saudi Arabia wants to allow the price to fall further.• Opposition to fracking (negative externalities) environmental lobby tries to curb supplies.• US$ may become too strong if its economy strengthens leading to more expensive oil for importing countries and a possible loss of markets to rival suppliers in OPEC and Russia.(Maximum 4 marks)

        Question: Reduced Migration to the United States (US)
The factors of production land, labour, capital and enterprise form the basis for all economic output. Whilst land is geographically fixed, the other factors of production, for example labour, are mobile. Large numbers of migrants move from country to country every year. Many migrate to the US. 
The average increase in the number of migrants working in the US was 0.6 million per year until 2018. However, the Covid-19 restrictions in place since 2019 prevented migration and by 2022 the total number of migrants working in the US was nearly 2 million lower than expected.
Half of migrants initially come as students, to be college educated, often in science-based subjects. Post-graduation, they often remain to work in the high-tech industries, before many return to their home countries with enhanced skills. 
Well-educated immigrants are three times more likely to start businesses than inhabitants of the US. The reduction in the number of new migrants would reduce the number of new businesses and this, in turn, would reduce job creation by an estimated 200000.
The remaining non-college educated migrants work mainly in lower-paid sectors such as retail and agriculture. They also play an important role in industries such as hospitality and food-related services. Many of the migrants send money to family members who remain in their home countries.

The reduction in migrants took place at the same time as more older US workers retired.
Mexicans and Central Americans form the largest share of migrants, at over 35% of the total. Average incomes in their home countries are between 10% and 20% of the US average. There is also significant unemployment and under-employment in their home countries. In the US, migrants earn on average 12% less than the average wage for all workers. This varies by ethnic origin: Hispanic workers earn 16% less than the average while white workers earn 15% more than average.

        Question: Competition, monopoly and the market
Firms are sometimes thought of as machines: inputs go in, products come out. However, it matters how powerful these firms are allowed to become.
Competition law – the law that governs how firms compete in the market, how they may exert their power and how and when they may join forces – has not prevented high concentration ratios in many industries.
Global monopolies have been created in the name of ‘free market’ capitalism. Mergers have been approved and monopolies tolerated under the assumption that they are efficient. Their ability to enable innovation is relied upon to justify these monopolised industries.
Competition law is being used to protect a narrow set of public interests based on the idea of ‘consumer welfare’. The test applied by the law is whether any change will result in lower prices for consumers and thus is beneficial. This is regardless of how monopolised the resulting market structure becomes.
The logic that focuses on consumer prices is flawed. This can be seen in the impacts of firms on the environment. Prices do not capture the negative externalities of production, for which neither the producer nor the consumer pays. 
Low consumer prices are not an adequate indicator for consumer welfare. The low price/low wage spiral keeps pushing for cheaper goods and services to increase the profitability of the firm. The result is that workers are paid less. Low prices cause unequal bargaining positions between powerful employers and workers, and between powerful buyers and small independent suppliers.
Regulation has a role to play in protecting consumers from the worst abuses of market power by firms. There needs, however, to be new competition law that promotes the free market rather than the desires of the monopoly firms. It needs to consider the balance of power between the public sector and private enterprise.

Assess, with the help of a diagram, whether economic theory supports the idea that monopolies are efficient.
Definition of efficiency:

Productive efficiency producing at the lowest cost for the particular output. (2)
Allocative efficiency where every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the marginal cost of producing it. (2)

Diagram should illustrate:Correctly drawn and labelled Monopoly diagram. (3marks)
Conclusion: the theory does not support this opinion. (1)

        Question: Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories. This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

        Question: Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.



The oil production processes used by Saudi Arabia and the US have different proportions of fixed costs and variable costs.Analyse why the fall in the price of oil may have a more significant effect on the output of oil in the US. [7]

The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.

The oil production processes used by Saudi Arabia and the US use different proportions of fixed costs and variable costs.
Analyse why the fall in the price of oil may have a more significant effect on the output of oil in the US.
Definition of variable costs (1 mark) and fixed costs. (1mark)Recognition of higher variable costs (VC) in USA and/or lower VC in Saudi Arabia/Russia. (1 mark)
Explanation of the relationship between price and average variable costs:-

If the price remains above AVC but below ATC a US well can still make a contribution to fixed costs, reducing losses. (1 mark)
If price is less than AVC a US well cannot continue in production as losses would be greater than fixed costs. (1 mark)

Conclusion: Some US oil wells may close (1 mark) but without more detailed information on the AVC of US wells no definite estimate of the number can be made. (1 mark)

        Question: Competition in the skies over Europe
In the sixteen months to April 2019 thirteen airlines ceased trading in Europe. This reflected a global trend where small airlines found it increasingly difficult to compete against large airlines, which have continued to grow.
Large airlines charge a price for a flight that includes meals and entertainment for passengers. Smaller airlines charge a price for the flight only and passengers need to pay extra for other services such as meals. 
Large airlines benefit from economies of scale. Without these cost-reductions some smaller airlines have gone bankrupt.
The reduction in the number of airlines has not reduced the overcapacity in the market because the aircrew and aircraft of the bankrupt airlines were acquired by the remaining companies, which have developed into super-airlines. This has left passengers with fewer airlines to choose from and more expensive fares. It was predicted that this would lead to an increase in the market share for the top five European airlines from 50% of the European market in 2019 to match the top five United States (US) airlines, which control 77% of the US market.
The development of super-airlines took place at the same time as increasing regulation of the airline market. For example, the European Union (EU) will only grant operating licences for flights between EU countries to an EU airline. This has prevented non-EU airlines from competing on EU routes.
For the super-airlines, large scale is the easy way to avoid the stresses and strains of open competition. For passengers this will lead to higher prices and poorer service.

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

Identify two types of local government intervention allowed in 2018 and discuss how these might affect the profits of taxi owners.

Minimum wages: (1) increases costs, fares could increase as a result, change in revenue uncertain. Depends on reaction of demand. Company operates on basis of low wage costs, likely that profits would decrease but change in profits uncertain.
restrict number of competitor taxis; (1) supply reduced so fares may increase. But increases in demand as population changes or becomes more wealthy may occur. Effect on profits uncertain.
no increase in medallion fee. (1) This would keep one of the fixed costs constant with a possible increase in profits.

        Question: Airport Expansion
In 2014, a proposal by Heathrow Airport Authority (HAA) in London recommended building an extra runway at Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. HAA acknowledged that it was an initial proposal that needed more detailed work.
They claimed that, if built, the runway would deliver greater economic benefits and be a better option for economic growth for the UK than any other proposal for new airport capacity. HAA was not able to quantify the benefits with any precision but said they would range from £50 billion to £156 billion (US$84 billion to US$262 billion) with a ‘central estimate’ of over £100 billion (US$168 billion). The majority would benefit the wider economy by creating jobs, encouraging trade, boosting spending and improving public finances. The proposal would allow the airport to be connected to more emerging markets and enable 40 new destinations to be served directly, including some in India and China. Cargo volumes would double and UK competitiveness would increase.
HAA added that more efficient vehicles, an increased proportion of passengers travelling by public transport and new aircraft technology would mean that the extra flights would not exceed the European Union pollution limits.
In order to build the new runway, major motorways would need to be altered. Many homes would have to be demolished but the airport said they would pay the owners 25% above the property’s market value. When it was built, car drivers wishing to take passengers to the airport would have to pay a congestion charge.
Those opposing the new runway said that thousands of people would be forced out of their homes and communities would be destroyed and, while waiting for a decision to be made, they would be unable to sell their homes. 240 000 people would suffer from airport noise.
HAA said the runway would cost £15.6 billion (US$26.2 billion) to build, with the government paying £1.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) towards the motorway alterations.
There were alternative proposals. The first was to build a completely new airport to the east of Heathrow. The second was to add another runway to an existing airport, Gatwick, to the south of Heathrow.
HAA argued that a completely new airport would take much longer to build and be more expensive than an extra runway and would mean higher fares for passengers.
The owners of Gatwick Airport insisted that the new runway at Heathrow was not in the best interest of passengers and that Gatwick would be better able to offer lower fares and connect to emerging markets with longer-range aircraft. They said that their plans were cheaper – £7.8 billion (US$13.1 billion) – and could be built quicker than the Heathrow option, with less disruption to motorways. Noise from another runway at Gatwick would also affect fewer people – 14 000, not 240 000.

        Question: The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.
Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth. The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.

        ","The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.
Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth. The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.
For South Africa’s economy to grow it needs to address major infrastructure issues. Also, in disadvantaged communities the education system is weak contributing to a skills shortage and a rise in the unemployment rate to 27% (see Fig. 1.2). Increased production is further hindered by restrictive trade union practices.

Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy.
Various government reforms and poor performances of some state industries have undermined confidence in the entire South African economy. (1)
This can be illustrated by the lack of investment by the private sector in the mining industry leading to increasing unemployment. (1)
The South African economy has also been diminished in the international economy as indicated by the fall in FDI (Figure 3) (1)
High unemployment means low consumer expenditure and low growth in AD. (1)
Future prospects for improvement seem limited in the short run (1). Longer term it needs to overcome a skills shortage by reforming education (1) and restrictive trade union practices. (1) Nevertheless, there is some increase in FDI (1). Longer term increase in infrastructure (1). An increase in employment/economic growth in the economy (1)

        Question: Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.
An economist said that the most effective intervention a government can make in the housing market is to relax the planning system and make it easier and cheaper to build more homes. Increased supply, leading to lower prices, would encourage demand. Others said that ‘although there is talk of a large rise in the price of houses, it is not uniform throughout the country and trying to influence the basic laws of supply and demand is not the right way of tackling the problem.’
The buying of housing gives rise to increased consumer spending and some argue that this helps the economy. Although policies by the government and the central bank had increased consumer demand and spending, such expenditure is quite different from the export-led growth model preferred by the government. Analysts suggested that the demand and supply conditions causing the current situation cannot last forever. When they end, the effect on the housing market (which by then will have many people with very high debts) will be very bad for the economy. This can be seen in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where property values are in decline.

        Question: The United States (US) EconomyAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the US in the first quarter of 2015, the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 0.2% compared with an increase of 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase reflected positive contributions from consumption expenditure and company investment. These were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP,increased. Some selected changes in GDP contributions are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Selected changes in US GDP components

The slower overall growth of GDP in the first quarter of 2015 may have been linked to changes in other countries. China's economic growth rate was reported to have dropped from over 10% to 7%; the Russian economy was affected by low oil prices and economic sanctions; Brazil was experiencing high inflation and low business confidence; Canada's economic growth rate was predicted to decrease because of lower oil prices.In addition to changes in other countries, business spending in the US on equipment, machinery and buildings decreased.There was, however, some revival in consumer confidence. House prices rose on average by 5% and a rising demand for housing was expected to continue. The labour market appeared to be improving with unfilled job vacancies at their highest level since 2008. Larger companies were reported to be about to offer pay rises to their lower paid workers. Wage growth, however, has to be paid for somehow and executives said that they had little room for cutting other costs. This, together with fierce competition, made it difficult to increase prices: cuts in profits seemed more likely.Source: Sunday Times, 3 May 2015



Discuss whether there is any evidence in the information to suggest that the US could have expected a higher rate of growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2015 than that which occurred.[7]

        Question: Public services – better or worse? 
A government usually has macroeconomic policy aims that it hopes will enable some success in raising the quality of life, or well-being, of the population. In doing this the government also hopes to achieve efficiency in the use of resources.
Efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs. Inputs are relatively easy to count: they are financial costs of public services. Output can also be counted, but it is not necessarily a good measure of the outcome. The outcome is much harder to calculate. It is broader and more subjective – how do we assess whether a public service is 'better' or 'worse'?
This is where a knowledge of well-being makes an enormous difference. It could provide a much clearer view of the trade-offs that have to be made in allocating taxpayers' money to public services. Take the example of healthcare. To maximise the impact of expenditure on well-being, the budget may need to be adjusted to give more to mental health services and less to building general hospitals. For older people it could mean giving priority to programmes that would keep them out of hospital. 
A focus on well-being should lead to better outcomes. This is where policymakers need a better understanding of behavioural economics. Governments have established Behavioural Insights teams, or Nudge Units. They have had some success. A small change in the wording of a letter to people who owed tax demonstrated how more behaviourally sensitive language sped up payments. The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.
Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

        Question: Airport Expansion
In 2014, a proposal by Heathrow Airport Authority (HAA) in London recommended building an extra runway at Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. HAA acknowledged that it was an initial proposal that needed more detailed work.
They claimed that, if built, the runway would deliver greater economic benefits and be a better option for economic growth for the UK than any other proposal for new airport capacity. HAA was not able to quantify the benefits with any precision but said they would range from £50 billion to £156 billion (US$84 billion to US$262 billion) with a ‘central estimate’ of over £100 billion (US$168 billion). The majority would benefit the wider economy by creating jobs, encouraging trade, boosting spending and improving public finances. The proposal would allow the airport to be connected to more emerging markets and enable 40 new destinations to be served directly, including some in India and China. Cargo volumes would double and UK competitiveness would increase.
HAA added that more efficient vehicles, an increased proportion of passengers travelling by public transport and new aircraft technology would mean that the extra flights would not exceed the European Union pollution limits.
In order to build the new runway, major motorways would need to be altered. Many homes would have to be demolished but the airport said they would pay the owners 25% above the property’s market value. When it was built, car drivers wishing to take passengers to the airport would have to pay a congestion charge.
Those opposing the new runway said that thousands of people would be forced out of their homes and communities would be destroyed and, while waiting for a decision to be made, they would be unable to sell their homes. 240 000 people would suffer from airport noise.
HAA said the runway would cost £15.6 billion (US$26.2 billion) to build, with the government paying £1.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) towards the motorway alterations.
There were alternative proposals. The first was to build a completely new airport to the east of Heathrow. The second was to add another runway to an existing airport, Gatwick, to the south of Heathrow.
HAA argued that a completely new airport would take much longer to build and be more expensive than an extra runway and would mean higher fares for passengers.
The owners of Gatwick Airport insisted that the new runway at Heathrow was not in the best interest of passengers and that Gatwick would be better able to offer lower fares and connect to emerging markets with longer-range aircraft. They said that their plans were cheaper – £7.8 billion (US$13.1 billion) – and could be built quicker than the Heathrow option, with less disruption to motorways. Noise from another runway at Gatwick would also affect fewer people – 14 000, not 240 000.

        ","Airport Expansion
In 2014, a proposal by Heathrow Airport Authority (HAA) in London recommended building an extra runway at Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. HAA acknowledged that it was an initial proposal that needed more detailed work.
They claimed that, if built, the runway would deliver greater economic benefits and be a better option for economic growth for the UK than any other proposal for new airport capacity. HAA was not able to quantify the benefits with any precision but said they would range from £50 billion to £156 billion (US$84 billion to US$262 billion) with a ‘central estimate’ of over £100 billion (US$168 billion). The majority would benefit the wider economy by creating jobs, encouraging trade, boosting spending and improving public finances. The proposal would allow the airport to be connected to more emerging markets and enable 40 new destinations to be served directly, including some in India and China. Cargo volumes would double and UK competitiveness would increase.
HAA added that more efficient vehicles, an increased proportion of passengers travelling by public transport and new aircraft technology would mean that the extra flights would not exceed the European Union pollution limits.
In order to build the new runway, major motorways would need to be altered. Many homes would have to be demolished but the airport said they would pay the owners 25% above the property’s market value. When it was built, car drivers wishing to take passengers to the airport would have to pay a congestion charge.
Those opposing the new runway said that thousands of people would be forced out of their homes and communities would be destroyed and, while waiting for a decision to be made, they would be unable to sell their homes. 240 000 people would suffer from airport noise.
HAA said the runway would cost £15.6 billion (US$26.2 billion) to build, with the government paying £1.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) towards the motorway alterations.

Consider whether the information in the proposal by the HAA was mainly factual evidence oropinion and comment on whether you would support the proposal. [7]","d
Opinion–no firm statistics, initial proposal, needs more information; range of monetary value of benefits uncertain and very wide; general statement about extent of wider benefits; presumption that many airport user would travel by public transport; vague statement about pollution being within EU limits; comments on value of benefit being greater than other options is not matched by the figures produced from one alternative; no published information of comparative fares between alternative projects; fact–they would pay compensation 25% above market rate for property; homes would be demolished–the actual number is debateable; there would be noise; more destinations would be served; cost would be lower than a completely new airport; conclusion.

        Question: Romania's economy booms
Romania, like other former planned economies in eastern Europe has increased the amount of private enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in its economy. Romania's economy has boomed in recent years and compares favourably with economies in the European Union (EU) as indicated in Fig. 1.1.

This economic boom has been characterised by the expansion of services and manufacturing sectors. In particular the high-tech industries have been very successful and are expected to double their contribution to GDP to 12% by 2025. The low wage rate in Romania was a benefit for foreign companies. For example, global car companies have, since 2008, invested US$1.4 billion in Romania’s car factories that has increased employment. 
After Romania joined the EU in 2007, many Romanian workers took advantage of the free movement of labour the EU allows. In 2008, 600000 out of a population of 21.2m left Romania. In spite of its economic boom, Romania has failed to attract sufficient workers back and there is now a shortage of labour. The total population is lower than in 2008 at 19.4m. Unemployment was only 5.9% in 2017 compared with an average rate of 8.6% for the EU as a whole. 
Since 2015, the government has taken measures to boost the economy. It reduced sales tax from 24% to 19%, which increased consumer demand. It also doubled the national minimum wage providing a boost for both private sector and public sector employment. 
But there are also serious economic challenges. The gap between government income and spending has widened causing a rising budget deficit. The transport infrastructure remains poor. In a World Economic Forum report in 2016, Romania was ranked 128th out of 138 countries for the quality of its road network and 79th for its railway system.

The information states that Romania had a budget deficit. Explain what is meant by a budget deficit and discuss whether the measures taken by the government in 2015 were likely to reduce this deficit.
Explanation of the term (2)Reduced taxes would be no help initially but extra spending may increase revenue in longer term. Depends on elasticity of demand for products. Likely to reduce deficit. (3)Minimum wage may increase spending; government doesn’t have to pay for the increased wage in private industry. But they do have to pay for minimum wage in public sector. Increased income/consumer spending raises tax revenue. In the short run this would be likely to increase the deficit. In the long run the change in deficit is more uncertain. (2)

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

Minimum wages: (1) increases costs, fares could increase as a result, change in revenue uncertain. Depends on reaction of demand. Company operates on basis of low wage costs, likely that profits would decrease but change in profits uncertain.
restrict number of competitor taxis; (1) supply reduced so fares may increase. But increases in demand as population changes or becomes more wealthy may occur. Effect on profits uncertain.
no increase in medallion fee. (1) This would keep one of the fixed costs constant with a possible increase in profits.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

        Question: Well-being and economic growth
For many years governments have sought to deal with economic performance with policies and tools based on the assumption that consumers would act rationally in response to incentives or sanctions. They have also operated public sector services assuming that the best outcome is achieved through the power of government to regulate, tax and spend.  
The tools the government uses are designed to influence consumer demand, often with the aim of increasing economic growth and GDP. But economic growth does not guarantee rising prosperity and well-being, as illustrated by Table 1.1 that compares HDI and GDP of selected countries. 
Ideally, all major investment projects in the public sector should require a cost-benefit analysis. This assesses the wider effects of projects. The project may have different effects on a poorer group than on a wealthy group. For example, a poorer group may gain considerably more benefit, or well-being, from a government grant than a richer group.
Some economies have tried to influence economic growth by using an expansionary monetary policy. In some countries this has meant that bank interest rates have been kept very low. It was hoped that this would encourage investment and borrowing and increase spending. Recently there has been some pressure to raise interest rates. But raising interest rates is not always wise. 
Higher interest rates could be justified in an economy experiencing economic growth, falling unemployment and an increase in business investment with the result that there are fewer unused resources in the economy. 
Against that, higher interest rates could decrease consumer spending and also result in a decrease in investment. This may mean no increase in real wages. It could suggest interest rates should stay low.

        Question: Health and well-being
European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

The WHO suggested that governments should consider introducing sugar taxes, a minimum price for alcohol and also subsidies on fruit and vegetables.
To try and limit smoking, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has conducted advertising campaigns warning of the dangers of smoking and banned smoking in public places. It has also put high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, it has refused to place a tax on all sugar consumption and there are no minimum prices for alcohol.
The WHO report attempted to measure well-being. Education, housing, health, sanitation and employment are all part of life satisfaction; how much money people have, it said, is not the major determinant. Happiness appears to require an annual income of US$10000, according to the WHO. People's sense of well-being is undermined if they earn less than that but does not increase if they earn more. ""We do not quite understand why this is"", said the WHO. ""Why do people in poorer countries report higher satisfaction than in countries where incomes are higher?""

Indifference curve analysis states that as income increases consumers move to a new, 'higher' indifference curve and this gives more satisfaction. For normal goods the consumption would also increase as incomes increase. A diagram is not required but it is likely that candidates would explain the analysis with a diagram. Evidence is that higher incomes do not necessarily result in a higher proportion of the population smoking. The evidence is inconclusive whether a higher level of income for an individual resulted in an increased demand (as would be expected by the theory) as the figures are overall averages and show differences between countries rather than an increase in income in any one country.

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

Identify two types of local government intervention allowed in 2018 and discuss how these might affect the profits of taxi owners.

Minimum wages: (1) increases costs, fares could increase as a result, change in revenue uncertain. Depends on reaction of demand. Company operates on basis of low wage costs, likely that profits would decrease but change in profits uncertain.
restrict number of competitor taxis; (1) supply reduced so fares may increase. But increases in demand as population changes or becomes more wealthy may occur. Effect on profits uncertain.
no increase in medallion fee. (1) This would keep one of the fixed costs constant with a possible increase in profits.

        Question: Public services – better or worse? 
A government usually has macroeconomic policy aims that it hopes will enable some success in raising the quality of life, or well-being, of the population. In doing this the government also hopes to achieve efficiency in the use of resources.
Efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs. Inputs are relatively easy to count: they are financial costs of public services. Output can also be counted, but it is not necessarily a good measure of the outcome. The outcome is much harder to calculate. It is broader and more subjective – how do we assess whether a public service is 'better' or 'worse'?
This is where a knowledge of well-being makes an enormous difference. It could provide a much clearer view of the trade-offs that have to be made in allocating taxpayers' money to public services. Take the example of healthcare. To maximise the impact of expenditure on well-being, the budget may need to be adjusted to give more to mental health services and less to building general hospitals. For older people it could mean giving priority to programmes that would keep them out of hospital. 
A focus on well-being should lead to better outcomes. This is where policymakers need a better understanding of behavioural economics. Governments have established Behavioural Insights teams, or Nudge Units. They have had some success. A small change in the wording of a letter to people who owed tax demonstrated how more behaviourally sensitive language sped up payments. The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.
Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.
Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

        Question: Airport Expansion
In 2014, a proposal by Heathrow Airport Authority (HAA) in London recommended building an extra runway at Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. HAA acknowledged that it was an initial proposal that needed more detailed work.
They claimed that, if built, the runway would deliver greater economic benefits and be a better option for economic growth for the UK than any other proposal for new airport capacity. HAA was not able to quantify the benefits with any precision but said they would range from £50 billion to £156 billion (US$84 billion to US$262 billion) with a ‘central estimate’ of over £100 billion (US$168 billion). The majority would benefit the wider economy by creating jobs, encouraging trade, boosting spending and improving public finances. The proposal would allow the airport to be connected to more emerging markets and enable 40 new destinations to be served directly, including some in India and China. Cargo volumes would double and UK competitiveness would increase.
HAA added that more efficient vehicles, an increased proportion of passengers travelling by public transport and new aircraft technology would mean that the extra flights would not exceed the European Union pollution limits.
In order to build the new runway, major motorways would need to be altered. Many homes would have to be demolished but the airport said they would pay the owners 25% above the property’s market value. When it was built, car drivers wishing to take passengers to the airport would have to pay a congestion charge.
Those opposing the new runway said that thousands of people would be forced out of their homes and communities would be destroyed and, while waiting for a decision to be made, they would be unable to sell their homes. 240 000 people would suffer from airport noise.
HAA said the runway would cost £15.6 billion (US$26.2 billion) to build, with the government paying £1.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) towards the motorway alterations.
There were alternative proposals. The first was to build a completely new airport to the east of Heathrow. The second was to add another runway to an existing airport, Gatwick, to the south of Heathrow.
HAA argued that a completely new airport would take much longer to build and be more expensive than an extra runway and would mean higher fares for passengers.
The owners of Gatwick Airport insisted that the new runway at Heathrow was not in the best interest of passengers and that Gatwick would be better able to offer lower fares and connect to emerging markets with longer-range aircraft. They said that their plans were cheaper – £7.8 billion (US$13.1 billion) – and could be built quicker than the Heathrow option, with less disruption to motorways. Noise from another runway at Gatwick would also affect fewer people – 14 000, not 240 000.

Consider whether the information in the proposal by the HAA was mainly factual evidence oropinion and comment on whether you would support the proposal. [7]

        Question: The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.
Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth. The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.
For South Africa’s economy to grow it needs to address major infrastructure issues. Also, in disadvantaged communities the education system is weak contributing to a skills shortage and a rise in the unemployment rate to 27% (see Fig. 1.2). Increased production is further hindered by restrictive trade union practices.

An analyst said: ‘A critical reason for low economic growth has been a lack of private sector investment and FDI (see Fig. 1.3). The lack of investment wasn’t just due to the political policies but also to uncertainty and mismanagement which led to continued inequalities.’

Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy. [7]

Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy.
Various government reforms and poor performances of some state industries have undermined confidence in the entire South African economy. (1)
This can be illustrated by the lack of investment by the private sector in the mining industry leading to increasing unemployment. (1)
The South African economy has also been diminished in the international economy as indicated by the fall in FDI (Figure 3) (1)
High unemployment means low consumer expenditure and low growth in AD. (1)
Future prospects for improvement seem limited in the short run (1). Longer term it needs to overcome a skills shortage by reforming education (1) and restrictive trade union practices. (1) Nevertheless, there is some increase in FDI (1). Longer term increase in infrastructure (1). An increase in employment/economic growth in the economy (1)

        Question: Infrastructure is restricting Indonesia's economic development
One feature of Indonesia's economy that has been hampering its economic and social development is the lack of quality and quantity of its infrastructure, whether it is 'hard' like roads or 'soft' like education.
In recent years the Indonesian government has given infrastructure a relatively small allocation of public spending. In 2011 only 2.1% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was reserved for infrastructure. In comparison, countries such as China and India spend almost 10% of their GDP on infrastructure. Since the late 1990s expansion of Indonesia’s infrastructure has not matched macroeconomic expansion, and as a consequence economic growth has not reached its full potential. It is estimated that GDP could grow at 1%–2.5% more than the current annual rate.
Lack of adequate infrastructure causes distribution costs such as transport and warehousing to rise steeply, thus reducing Indonesia's competitiveness and attractiveness as an investment location. According to data published by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin Indonesia), around 17% of a typical company's total expenditure is absorbed by such costs. In other south-east Asian economies this is below 10%. In particular transport costs are high; by land as well as sea. Despite Indonesia's island geography, sea transport is yet to be developed substantially. Currently, sea transport is even more expensive than land transport. This results in inflationary pressures on domestically produced products. It partly explains why some domestically grown fruit is more expensive than imported fruit. It also leads to substantial regional price differences. Rice, for example, is much more expensive in eastern Indonesia than in Java or Sumatra. It also prevents businesses from expanding and profitable opportunities are lost.
Indonesia suffers from inadequacies in the country's electricity supply, despite the abundance of energy resources. Part of the problem is that the state-owned electricity distributor, which has a monopoly on electricity distribution, is heavily dependent on government subsidies as the cost of production is higher than the fixed maximum selling price.
Soft infrastructure such as education, healthcare and social welfare is also under-developed. The government has made efforts to improve these areas in recent years. A new healthcare system is about to be introduced covering all Indonesians and spending on education has increased markedly.

        Question: Competition in the skies over Europe
In the sixteen months to April 2019 thirteen airlines ceased trading in Europe. This reflected a global trend where small airlines found it increasingly difficult to compete against large airlines, which have continued to grow.
Large airlines charge a price for a flight that includes meals and entertainment for passengers. Smaller airlines charge a price for the flight only and passengers need to pay extra for other services such as meals. 
Large airlines benefit from economies of scale. Without these cost-reductions some smaller airlines have gone bankrupt.
The reduction in the number of airlines has not reduced the overcapacity in the market because the aircrew and aircraft of the bankrupt airlines were acquired by the remaining companies, which have developed into super-airlines. This has left passengers with fewer airlines to choose from and more expensive fares. It was predicted that this would lead to an increase in the market share for the top five European airlines from 50% of the European market in 2019 to match the top five United States (US) airlines, which control 77% of the US market.
The development of super-airlines took place at the same time as increasing regulation of the airline market. For example, the European Union (EU) will only grant operating licences for flights between EU countries to an EU airline. This has prevented non-EU airlines from competing on EU routes.
For the super-airlines, large scale is the easy way to avoid the stresses and strains of open competition. For passengers this will lead to higher prices and poorer service.

        Question: Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories. This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

        Question: Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

        Question: Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.



The oil production processes used by Saudi Arabia and the US have different proportions of fixed costs and variable costs.Analyse why the fall in the price of oil may have a more significant effect on the output of oil in the US. [7]

The oil production processes used by Saudi Arabia and the US use different proportions of fixed costs and variable costs.
Analyse why the fall in the price of oil may have a more significant effect on the output of oil in the US.
Definition of variable costs (1 mark) and fixed costs. (1mark)Recognition of higher variable costs (VC) in USA and/or lower VC in Saudi Arabia/Russia. (1 mark)
Explanation of the relationship between price and average variable costs:-

If the price remains above AVC but below ATC a US well can still make a contribution to fixed costs, reducing losses. (1 mark)
If price is less than AVC a US well cannot continue in production as losses would be greater than fixed costs. (1 mark)

Conclusion: Some US oil wells may close (1 mark) but without more detailed information on the AVC of US wells no definite estimate of the number can be made. (1 mark)

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

Identify two types of local government intervention allowed in 2018 and discuss how these might affect the profits of taxi owners.

Minimum wages: (1) increases costs, fares could increase as a result, change in revenue uncertain. Depends on reaction of demand. Company operates on basis of low wage costs, likely that profits would decrease but change in profits uncertain.
restrict number of competitor taxis; (1) supply reduced so fares may increase. But increases in demand as population changes or becomes more wealthy may occur. Effect on profits uncertain.
no increase in medallion fee. (1) This would keep one of the fixed costs constant with a possible increase in profits.

        Question: Well-being and economic growth
For many years governments have sought to deal with economic performance with policies and tools based on the assumption that consumers would act rationally in response to incentives or sanctions. They have also operated public sector services assuming that the best outcome is achieved through the power of government to regulate, tax and spend.  
The tools the government uses are designed to influence consumer demand, often with the aim of increasing economic growth and GDP. But economic growth does not guarantee rising prosperity and well-being, as illustrated by Table 1.1 that compares HDI and GDP of selected countries. 
Ideally, all major investment projects in the public sector should require a cost-benefit analysis. This assesses the wider effects of projects. The project may have different effects on a poorer group than on a wealthy group. For example, a poorer group may gain considerably more benefit, or well-being, from a government grant than a richer group.
Some economies have tried to influence economic growth by using an expansionary monetary policy. In some countries this has meant that bank interest rates have been kept very low. It was hoped that this would encourage investment and borrowing and increase spending. Recently there has been some pressure to raise interest rates. But raising interest rates is not always wise. 
Higher interest rates could be justified in an economy experiencing economic growth, falling unemployment and an increase in business investment with the result that there are fewer unused resources in the economy. 
Against that, higher interest rates could decrease consumer spending and also result in a decrease in investment. This may mean no increase in real wages. It could suggest interest rates should stay low.

        Question: Health and well-being
European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

The WHO suggested that governments should consider introducing sugar taxes, a minimum price for alcohol and also subsidies on fruit and vegetables.
To try and limit smoking, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has conducted advertising campaigns warning of the dangers of smoking and banned smoking in public places. It has also put high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, it has refused to place a tax on all sugar consumption and there are no minimum prices for alcohol.
The WHO report attempted to measure well-being. Education, housing, health, sanitation and employment are all part of life satisfaction; how much money people have, it said, is not the major determinant. Happiness appears to require an annual income of US$10000, according to the WHO. People's sense of well-being is undermined if they earn less than that but does not increase if they earn more. ""We do not quite understand why this is"", said the WHO. ""Why do people in poorer countries report higher satisfaction than in countries where incomes are higher?""
Source: The Guardian, 23 September 2015



Explain, according to indifference curve analysis, what happens to a consumer's satisfaction and demand as income rises. Consider whether the evidence in Table 1.1 about income levels, as shown by GDP per capita, and smoking, is sufficient to support that analysis. [7]

It has also put high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, it has refused to place a tax on all sugar consumption and there are no minimum prices for alcohol.
The WHO report attempted to measure well-being. Education, housing, health, sanitation and employment are all part of life satisfaction; how much money people have, it said, is not the major determinant. Happiness appears to require an annual income of US$10000, according to the WHO. People's sense of well-being is undermined if they earn less than that but does not increase if they earn more. ""We do not quite understand why this is"", said the WHO. ""Why do people in poorer countries report higher satisfaction than in countries where incomes are higher?""
Source: The Guardian, 23 September 2015



Explain, according to indifference curve analysis, what happens to a consumer's satisfaction and demand as income rises. Consider whether the evidence in Table 1.1 about income levels, as shown by GDP per capita, and smoking, is sufficient to support that analysis. [7]","d
Indifference curve analysis states that as income increases consumers move to a new, 'higher' indifference curve and this gives more satisfaction. For normal goods the consumption would also increase as incomes increase. A diagram is not required but it is likely that candidates would explain the analysis with a diagram. Evidence is that higher incomes do not necessarily result in a higher proportion of the population smoking. The evidence is inconclusive whether a higher level of income for an individual resulted in an increased demand (as would be expected by the theory) as the figures are overall averages and show differences between countries rather than an increase in income in any one country.

        Question: Competition in the skies over Europe
In the sixteen months to April 2019 thirteen airlines ceased trading in Europe. This reflected a global trend where small airlines found it increasingly difficult to compete against large airlines, which have continued to grow.
Large airlines charge a price for a flight that includes meals and entertainment for passengers. Smaller airlines charge a price for the flight only and passengers need to pay extra for other services such as meals. 
Large airlines benefit from economies of scale. Without these cost-reductions some smaller airlines have gone bankrupt.
The reduction in the number of airlines has not reduced the overcapacity in the market because the aircrew and aircraft of the bankrupt airlines were acquired by the remaining companies, which have developed into super-airlines. This has left passengers with fewer airlines to choose from and more expensive fares. It was predicted that this would lead to an increase in the market share for the top five European airlines from 50% of the European market in 2019 to match the top five United States (US) airlines, which control 77% of the US market.
The development of super-airlines took place at the same time as increasing regulation of the airline market. For example, the European Union (EU) will only grant operating licences for flights between EU countries to an EU airline. This has prevented non-EU airlines from competing on EU routes.
For the super-airlines, large scale is the easy way to avoid the stresses and strains of open competition. For passengers this will lead to higher prices and poorer service.

        Question: The economic impacts of the increasing use of all-electric cars
Some governments have agreed targets to reduce air pollution and, as part of this, are concerned about the social costs caused by the use of petrol and diesel vehicles. In response, car manufacturers are producing all-electric cars. The sales of these are increasing, especially in developed countries. The success of this switch to all-electric cars will depend on improving both battery technology as well as building an infrastructure in which, as drivers reduce their use of fossil fuels, electricity charging points will replace petrol pumps.
Fig. 1.1 shows the cumulative number of all-electric cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Fig. 1.2 shows the annual sales of all cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Some forecasters predict that about one third of the world’s cars will be all-electric by 2040. Their forecasts are based on the assumption that the costs of batteries to run these cars will have declined steeply from their present levels. Battery costs are dependent on supplies of various metals which are used as component parts. Supplies of these metals are finite and their prices, linked to mining costs, will be crucial in increasing the scale of all-electric car production.
In 2016, the cost of the batteries was 49% of the total cost of the car. In 2017 it was stated at a New Energy conference in Shanghai that battery prices would need to drop by more than half before all-electric cars would become competitive with cars powered by petrol and diesel engines. 
Oil producers claim that growth in sales of all-electric cars will not substantially reduce world demand for oil. The world needs oil for much more than just cars. Cars account for only about a fifth of the 95 million barrels the world consumes every day. Most of the rest is used in industry or to fuel heavy goods vehicles, aircraft and ships, which do not have easy non-oil alternatives. In developing economies, petrol sales are expected to continue rising because these countries do not have the infrastructure or sufficient capital investment to enable the switch to electric vehicles.

Assess the effects on the social costs of transport of replacing diesel and petrol engine cars with all-electric cars.

Some understanding required of private costs plus external costs = social costs: reward a definition and/or diagram [2]
Petrol and diesel engines emissions linked to negative externalities due to causing pollution of the atmosphere and health problems especially for those living in urban areas:MSC > MPC [1]
Electric car use will lower external costs through eliminating carbon pollution [1] but there may still be as many cars so problems of traffic congestion, especially in urban areas, will continue to get worse as demand for cars increases. [1]
Other transport – ships, planes, heavy goods vehicles – will still depend on oil and will probably increase as demand increases. External costs are likely to rise. [1]
Therefore, external costs will not be eliminated entirely. Some negative external costs will be associated also with increased mining of metal ores.[1]
However, the beneficial consumption externality of electric cars makes MSB > MPB so they will be promoted as a kind of merit good. Overall balance is uncertain. [1]

        Question: Romania's economy booms
Romania, like other former planned economies in eastern Europe has increased the amount of private enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in its economy. Romania's economy has boomed in recent years and compares favourably with economies in the European Union (EU) as indicated in Fig. 1.1.

This economic boom has been characterised by the expansion of services and manufacturing sectors. In particular the high-tech industries have been very successful and are expected to double their contribution to GDP to 12% by 2025. The low wage rate in Romania was a benefit for foreign companies. For example, global car companies have, since 2008, invested US$1.4 billion in Romania’s car factories that has increased employment. 
After Romania joined the EU in 2007, many Romanian workers took advantage of the free movement of labour the EU allows. In 2008, 600000 out of a population of 21.2m left Romania. In spite of its economic boom, Romania has failed to attract sufficient workers back and there is now a shortage of labour. The total population is lower than in 2008 at 19.4m. Unemployment was only 5.9% in 2017 compared with an average rate of 8.6% for the EU as a whole. 
Since 2015, the government has taken measures to boost the economy. It reduced sales tax from 24% to 19%, which increased consumer demand. It also doubled the national minimum wage providing a boost for both private sector and public sector employment. 
But there are also serious economic challenges. The gap between government income and spending has widened causing a rising budget deficit. The transport infrastructure remains poor. In a World Economic Forum report in 2016, Romania was ranked 128th out of 138 countries for the quality of its road network and 79th for its railway system.

Explanation of the term (2)Reduced taxes would be no help initially but extra spending may increase revenue in longer term. Depends on elasticity of demand for products. Likely to reduce deficit. (3)Minimum wage may increase spending; government doesn’t have to pay for the increased wage in private industry. But they do have to pay for minimum wage in public sector. Increased income/consumer spending raises tax revenue. In the short run this would be likely to increase the deficit. In the long run the change in deficit is more uncertain. (2)

        Question: Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.
An economist said that the most effective intervention a government can make in the housing market is to relax the planning system and make it easier and cheaper to build more homes. Increased supply, leading to lower prices, would encourage demand. Others said that ‘although there is talk of a large rise in the price of houses, it is not uniform throughout the country and trying to influence the basic laws of supply and demand is not the right way of tackling the problem.’
The buying of housing gives rise to increased consumer spending and some argue that this helps the economy. Although policies by the government and the central bank had increased consumer demand and spending, such expenditure is quite different from the export-led growth model preferred by the government. Analysts suggested that the demand and supply conditions causing the current situation cannot last forever. When they end, the effect on the housing market (which by then will have many people with very high debts) will be very bad for the economy. This can be seen in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where property values are in decline.

        Question: Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.

        Question: Health and well-being
European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

The WHO suggested that governments should consider introducing sugar taxes, a minimum price for alcohol and also subsidies on fruit and vegetables.
To try and limit smoking, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has conducted advertising campaigns warning of the dangers of smoking and banned smoking in public places. It has also put high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, it has refused to place a tax on all sugar consumption and there are no minimum prices for alcohol.
The WHO report attempted to measure well-being. Education, housing, health, sanitation and employment are all part of life satisfaction; how much money people have, it said, is not the major determinant. Happiness appears to require an annual income of US$10000, according to the WHO. People's sense of well-being is undermined if they earn less than that but does not increase if they earn more. ""We do not quite understand why this is"", said the WHO. ""Why do people in poorer countries report higher satisfaction than in countries where incomes are higher?""

Explain, according to indifference curve analysis, what happens to a consumer's satisfaction and demand as income rises. Consider whether the evidence in Table 1.1 about income levels, as shown by GDP per capita, and smoking, is sufficient to support that analysis. [7]

Explain, according to indifference curve analysis, what happens to a consumer's satisfaction and demand as income rises. Consider whether the evidence in Table 1.1 about income levels, as shown by GDP per capita, and smoking, is sufficient to support that analysis. [7]","d
Indifference curve analysis states that as income increases consumers move to a new, 'higher' indifference curve and this gives more satisfaction. For normal goods the consumption would also increase as incomes increase. A diagram is not required but it is likely that candidates would explain the analysis with a diagram. Evidence is that higher incomes do not necessarily result in a higher proportion of the population smoking. The evidence is inconclusive whether a higher level of income for an individual resulted in an increased demand (as would be expected by the theory) as the figures are overall averages and show differences between countries rather than an increase in income in any one country.

        Question: Well-being and economic growth
For many years governments have sought to deal with economic performance with policies and tools based on the assumption that consumers would act rationally in response to incentives or sanctions. They have also operated public sector services assuming that the best outcome is achieved through the power of government to regulate, tax and spend.  
The tools the government uses are designed to influence consumer demand, often with the aim of increasing economic growth and GDP. But economic growth does not guarantee rising prosperity and well-being, as illustrated by Table 1.1 that compares HDI and GDP of selected countries. 
Ideally, all major investment projects in the public sector should require a cost-benefit analysis. This assesses the wider effects of projects. The project may have different effects on a poorer group than on a wealthy group. For example, a poorer group may gain considerably more benefit, or well-being, from a government grant than a richer group.
Some economies have tried to influence economic growth by using an expansionary monetary policy. In some countries this has meant that bank interest rates have been kept very low. It was hoped that this would encourage investment and borrowing and increase spending. Recently there has been some pressure to raise interest rates. But raising interest rates is not always wise. 
Higher interest rates could be justified in an economy experiencing economic growth, falling unemployment and an increase in business investment with the result that there are fewer unused resources in the economy. 
Against that, higher interest rates could decrease consumer spending and also result in a decrease in investment. This may mean no increase in real wages. It could suggest interest rates should stay low.

        Question: Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner.

The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner.

Identify two types of local government intervention allowed in 2018 and discuss how these might affect the profits of taxi owners.

Minimum wages: (1) increases costs, fares could increase as a result, change in revenue uncertain. Depends on reaction of demand. Company operates on basis of low wage costs, likely that profits would decrease but change in profits uncertain.
restrict number of competitor taxis; (1) supply reduced so fares may increase. But increases in demand as population changes or becomes more wealthy may occur. Effect on profits uncertain.
no increase in medallion fee. (1) This would keep one of the fixed costs constant with a possible increase in profits.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Inequalities of wealth
In 2015, the vast and growing gap between rich and poor was revealed in a report from the charity Oxfam.
Oxfam said that between 2010 and 2015, the total wealth of the world's poorest 50% had fallen. In the same period, the wealth of the world's richest people had increased. In 2010, the 388 richest people in the world owned the same wealth as the poorest 50%. This fell to 80 people in 2014 and to only 62 people by 2015.
The report recommended that governments should do three things: make greater attempts to prevent tax avoidance; invest more in public services; and ensure there are higher wages for the low paid.
On taxes, the report emphasised the need to end the use of tax havens to hide large amounts of money. It estimated that the use of tax havens by multinational companies denies developing countries at least US$100 billion a year in tax revenue. In tax havens, which include the Cayman Islands, Dubai, Hong Kong, Liberia, Luxembourg, Singapore and Switzerland, taxes are either non-existent or levied at a low rate.
The Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean, refers to itself as an 'international financial centre'. Almost 20000 international companies are registered there. An official explained its function is to assist global capitalism to work. For example, if an American company and a Japanese company agree a business deal in their own countries they would pay tax. They would be more likely to agree the deal if it were done through a company in the Cayman Islands where no tax is paid.
It is not only the developed world which makes use of tax havens. Oxfam reported that as much as 30% of all African financial wealth was thought to be held in tax havens. The estimated loss of US$14 billion in tax revenues would be enough to pay for healthcare that could save the lives of 4 million children a year and employ enough teachers to get every African child into school.
To help the lowest income earners in society, government social welfare spending has become more important than ever. As well as preventing tax avoidance, a traditional cure for the problems from rising inequality has been to redistribute income through taxation from the richest to the poorest. However, this can lead to resentment and can impede economic growth.
A better cure would be to encourage innovation that would benefit everybody. A combination of the internet and computer revolutions is transforming the world economy which has led to economic growth. Inevitably the leaders of these kinds of enterprises have become some of the world's richest entrepreneurs.

Use the evidence in the article to consider the effect on business activity of using tax havens. [6]","c
Tax havens assist global capitalism to work: Businesses need to be encouraged to take risks and innovation and thereby increase the size of national income through the investment multiplier. This creates employment through an increase in AD. More likely to undertake deals if tax is low. Effect of this is weakened if MNCs pay low wages and send profits to tax havens. Positive link: Tax havens are used by entrepreneurs/MNC's to shelter incomes from taxation. These incomes could be used as investments by the MNC's to create further wealth in countries where they operate. Negative link: Income inequalities are becoming greater between rich and poor in both developed and developing countries. Taxes create resentment and may prevent investment and impede economic growth.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: The impact of demonetisation in India
India has a vast informal economy, where products and labour are exchanged for cash without official records, so that the authorities cannot easily trace the transactions. In November 2016, this informal economy was affected by a government decision to adopt a policy of 'demonetisation'.This involved the withdrawal from circulation of India's two most used bank notes, the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. This policy removed 14 trillion rupees of cash from the most cash-dependent major economy in the world. There were long queues outside banks as people tried to open bank accounts to deposit these notes before they were no longer valid.The policy was intended to remove cash hoarded by the very rich elite, criminals and the large number of people who did not pay tax.The government later said that demonetisation was also the first step in a 'cashless' revolution to move the billions of transactions undertaken each day in India through the banking system so that the tax authorities could trace them. In 2016, only 1% of workers paid income tax.
India's Labour Minister announced that it would become compulsory for employers to pay their employees through bank accounts, a hugely ambitious step in a country where as many as 90% of workers were paid in cash. Many business owners were dreading the prospect of paying their employees through bank accounts. One factory owner in Delhi commented: “How do you think I can pay the workers with a cheque if they don't have a bank account? It takes three days to clear a cheque. What will they eat during those days?”
The Indian government's vision of a cashless economy does not seem to correspond to the reality of working life in India. Another factory owner stated that this would affect the production process:“Rickshaw pullers transfer goods from my factory to the shops. For one trip I pay a rickshaw puller 100 rupees. Does the government expect me to give them a cheque for such a small amount?How do I pay them if I am not allowed to use cash? If I have to write a cheque for every payment this will increase my costs considerably.""The workers are also concerned about the change to the law that will force them to have their wages paid directly into banks. Money performs a number of important functions in an economy and cash has an acceptability that still matters for many workers. One worker commented: “I am a daily wage worker and I am not sure if I will have a job tomorrow. If I receive cash in hand, I know I have the money"".If demonetisation is to succeed, the Indian government will need to introduce incentives to persuade millions of people to open bank accounts. However, this will not be easy to achieve because around 30% of people in India still do not have bank accounts.Fig. 1.1 shows India's money supply as measured by M1, which consists of notes and coins in circulation and balances in bank deposits that can be spent immediately e.g. through withdrawals,cheques or debit cards.Source: Adapted from The Guardian, 21 December 2016

It could be inflationary if the government's increased tax revenue is used to stimulate aggregate demand in the Indian economy, but it depends on whether the government spends the tax revenue.However, if the wages of employees are paid directly into bank accounts, it may reduce the extent of liquidity in the economy, reducing any inflationary threat. Also, if some people are more fearful of the future of the economy, they may be more cautious in their spending patterns, again dampening down inflation.Credit reference to Quantity Theory of Money (although not on AS syllabus): the immediate impact is that the money supply goes down,when it will not be inflationary, but there will be an eventual increase in the money supply as people open bank accounts (as shown in Fig.1.1), which could be inflationary.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Discuss whether a minimum price for fuel would be effective in reducing the congestion caused by the demand for roads exceeding supply. [6]

        Question Type: Data Response, A-Level, 6 marks
        ","Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

*International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates
Source: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2017
Egypt's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) reported that Egypt's annual inflation rate surged to 32.9% in April 2017, compared to 10.9% in 2016. This is considerably higher than the expected rate that was estimated by the IMF shown in Table 1.1.
Inflation had been rising in Egypt since the decision of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) in November 2016 to float Egypt's currency (the Egyptian pound) in a move that caused a 50% depreciation in its value against the US dollar. This came as part of the Egyptian government's reform programme, started in 2014, to reduce the budget deficit and acquire a US$12 billion loan from the IMF to ease the US dollar shortage that had restricted Egypt's business activity.
A macroeconomic research group has said that 'The sharp rise in inflation could largely be attributed to the effects of the weaker Egyptian pound. Inflation was also made worse by levying a new indirect tax called Value Added Tax (VAT), and cutting subsidies on energy in November 2016.' On the same day as the CBE floated the Egyptian pound it raised the interest rate by 3 percentage points to 14.75%.
Egypt's VAT replaced the previous sales tax, which economists said created market distortions. It was expected to broaden the tax base in a country where the government struggles to collect income tax because of a large informal economy and widespread tax avoidance. The VAT does not apply to basic goods and services to protect the poor.

The unemployment rate is expected to fall from 2016. As a result, incomes will rise and it would be expected that imports would also rise. In addition, goods formerly exported would be diverted to satisfy rising demand in the home market. Net exports would decrease as a result and the current account balance become an increasing deficit. Alternatively, it could be argued that those who enter employment will boost production and this could offset imports or boost exports. Explanations developed along these lines are equally acceptable. Some candidates might offer the view that either outcome is possible. These approaches should also be credited. Up to 4 marks are available for explaining the link between the changes in unemployment and the current account balance. Two further marks are reserved for elaboration that considers any factors that the outcome of the change depends upon e.gs include the imposition of import controls, the income elasticity of demand for imports, exchange rate changes, the availability of other factors in the production process such as capital goods and the time period under consideration.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Fig. 1.1 Vietnam's current account balance, Q1 2016 to Q2 2018 (US$ million)
Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Are doughnuts demerit goods?
Consumers love to eat doughnuts. In 2019, 10 billion of these deep-fried sugar-coated products were consumed in the United States (US). Fig. 1.1 shows that the US market increased steadily from 2011 to 2019. Doughnuts are widely available throughout the US. There are specialist shops selling their branded products almost everywhere; local coffee shops invariably sell ‘hole in one’ doughnuts as a popular breakfast snack to tempt consumers on their way to work. The growing number of shops selling doughnuts has been an important reason behind overall market growth.

Source: ibisworld.com, March 2021
Fig. 1.1 Doughnut market size in the US, 2011 to 2021 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a varying impact on the US doughnut market. Despite having less income, many consumers have continued to buy small luxuries such as doughnuts which remain affordable and can provide some short-term relief from the stresses of the pandemic. Overall, sales of doughnuts fell in 2020 and are forecast to remain below their 2019 peak into 2021. Reasons for this fall in demand are that consumers are making fewer shopping trips and in cities, more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack.
In the United Kingdom (UK), more so than in the US, there are growing concerns about the increase in sugar consumption amongst children. This increase comes from soft drinks, chocolate biscuits and sweets (candy) as well as from jam-filled doughnuts, all of which are widely available in supermarkets and local convenience stores. In 2021, it was estimated that a third of teenagers and two thirds of adults in the UK were overweight. This has increased the pressure on the UK government to end online advertising of a range of products including doughnuts. It has been estimated that viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories. Moreover, a ban on advertising sugary foods would result in children consuming the equivalent of 62 million fewer doughnuts a year in the UK.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.

        Question: Fall in price of oil but Colombia can look forward to growth
Fig. 1: Colombia's growth and the oil priceSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream
Fig. 2: Colombian peso against the US dollar (peso per US$), inverted scaleSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream
Over the past year, the halving of crude oil prices has hit Colombia and much of South America hard. Venezuela's economy, for example, is expected to shrink by 7% this year. Colombia's national oil production was running at 1 million barrels a year, accounting for half of its exports and a fifth of government revenues. In Puerto Gaitan, which only a year ago was the centre of Colombia's oil industry, the town's population had tripled to 45000 in just a few years. Property prices had soared and hotels overflowed. Today, though, business profits have fallen, leading to a fall in spending by entrepreneurs. ""For Sale"" signs now hang over Puerto Gaitan's closed stores, car parks in shopping malls are empty and 10000 people have left the town. Towns throughout Colombia are experiencing similar problems.
Colombia's government is feeling the effects as well. Every US$1 drop in the oil price per barrel cuts an estimated US$200 million from government revenues. As a result, the government has cut spending and raised taxes to keep its budget deficit down. More worryingly, the collapse in the price of oil has opened a large current account deficit equivalent to 7% of national income. Yet not all is bleak. Colombia's economy is forecast to grow this year. And unlike in neighbouring Venezuela, where oil accounts for more than 90% of exports, there is concern but no panic.
Firstly, the peso's depreciation could reverse Colombia's current account problems, boosting traditional exports such as coffee, textiles, car parts and flowers — if not to its immediate neighbours, then to the United States. Colombia produces oil, but it is not only an oil-producing country. Secondly, Colombia's government is having peace talks with Marxist rebels to end the country's five decades of unrest. The government's military expenditure will be reduced and estimates suggest that this 'peace dividend' could add as much as 2 percentage points to growth.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Argentina raises interest rates to 40 per cent
Fig. 1.1: Argentina's exchange rate (pesos per US dollar), May 2016 to May 2018
On 4 May 2018, Argentina's central bank raised interest rates to 40%. The day before this increase they were raised from 30.25% to 33.25%. A week earlier, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises were aimed at supporting Argentina's currency, the peso, which lost a quarter of its value over the previous year. Despite these rises, the peso, which before the economic turmoil in Argentina in 2001–2002 was fixed at parity with the US dollar, was trading at about 22 pesos to the US dollar. Risks to the peso had been developing for some time. These included large budget and current account deficits, a heavy government debt burden, persistent high inflation and an overvalued currency. 
Inflation, a long-standing problem in Argentina, was 25% in 2017, the highest annual rate in South America except for Venezuela. The central bank has set an annual inflation target of 15% and has stated it will continue to take measures to achieve it.
Argentina's new president is pursuing a pro-market economic reform programme, seeking to reverse the protectionism and high government spending of previous governments. The president has pledged to reduce government spending drastically. The political opposition wants to stop him from removing subsidies on a range of basic household products, including gas and electricity. Removing the subsidies may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from its current high level to an annual rate of about 5% by 2020.
International and domestic investors still believe the president has a good plan for Argentina'seconomic recovery, but they are not convinced he has enough political support to achieve it.

In the extract it is stated that risks to the peso have been developing for some time and that large budget and current account deficits are some of these risks.





Use aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis to explain how the recent interest rate rises might help Argentina to reduce its annual rate of inflation and achieve its target. [6]

        Question: Inequalities of wealth
In 2015, the vast and growing gap between rich and poor was revealed in a report from the charity Oxfam.
Oxfam said that between 2010 and 2015, the total wealth of the world's poorest 50% had fallen. In the same period, the wealth of the world's richest people had increased. In 2010, the 388 richest people in the world owned the same wealth as the poorest 50%. This fell to 80 people in 2014 and to only 62 people by 2015.
The report recommended that governments should do three things: make greater attempts to prevent tax avoidance; invest more in public services; and ensure there are higher wages for the low paid.
On taxes, the report emphasised the need to end the use of tax havens to hide large amounts of money. It estimated that the use of tax havens by multinational companies denies developing countries at least US$100 billion a year in tax revenue. In tax havens, which include the Cayman Islands, Dubai, Hong Kong, Liberia, Luxembourg, Singapore and Switzerland, taxes are either non-existent or levied at a low rate.
The Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean, refers to itself as an 'international financial centre'. Almost 20000 international companies are registered there. An official explained its function is to assist global capitalism to work. For example, if an American company and a Japanese company agree a business deal in their own countries they would pay tax. They would be more likely to agree the deal if it were done through a company in the Cayman Islands where no tax is paid.
It is not only the developed world which makes use of tax havens. Oxfam reported that as much as 30% of all African financial wealth was thought to be held in tax havens. The estimated loss of US$14 billion in tax revenues would be enough to pay for healthcare that could save the lives of 4 million children a year and employ enough teachers to get every African child into school.
To help the lowest income earners in society, government social welfare spending has become more important than ever. As well as preventing tax avoidance, a traditional cure for the problems from rising inequality has been to redistribute income through taxation from the richest to the poorest. However, this can lead to resentment and can impede economic growth.
A better cure would be to encourage innovation that would benefit everybody. A combination of the internet and computer revolutions is transforming the world economy which has led to economic growth. Inevitably the leaders of these kinds of enterprises have become some of the world's richest entrepreneurs.

Discuss the economic consequences for governments whose citizens and businesses avoid paying tax on a high proportion of their incomes or profits. [6]","d
Governments face a shortfall in revenue. Therefore to cover government expenditure they need to borrow more because tax revenues are below potential. Education suffers, health care suffers. If the 'rich' do not pay sufficient tax there is an opportunity cost. Provision of welfare programmes, education, health provided by governments will be affected. Quote examples from text e.g. African countries. Governments incur administrative costs trying to recover tax which could be better spent on services. Government's macro-aims are affected e.g. capital outflows create balance of payments deficits. Governments may have to make welfare payments to unemployed workers if MNCs fail to invest profits back into the businesses where they were generated. But paying lower taxes could be profitable for companies who might then reinvest, research more and employ more people.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: European Union (EU) to boost protection of steel industry as imports flood inThe EU is expected to strengthen its protection against steel imports, possibly as early as October 2016, as a global trade war in steel intensifies and steel imports keep flooding into the EU.The EU has strengthened trade defences over the past year, imposing anti-dumping tariffs on a range of steel products. These tariffs range from 18% to 25% for imports of steel from China. It is expected that these duties will be increased in October. EU data shows that 27% of steel imports come from China. The EU now has 37 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place for steelproducts, 15 of them against China.China, which produces half of the world's 1.6 billion tonnes of steel, has struggled to reduce its estimated 300 million tonnes of overcapacity, but the Chinese government denies its firms are dumping by selling steel at below the cost of production. It says global steel overcapacity is due to the collapse of demand after the 2008 financial crisis. Countries from Asia to the Americas disagree with China. The United States (US) claims that the Chinese government is subsidising its steel industry and that this is a form of protectionism that gives Chinese steelmakers an unfair advantage in world markets. It has imposed tariffs of up to 450% on some types of Chinese steel.India has also imposed tariffs on steel imports from a number of countries including China, Japan,Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea.Source: EurActiv.com with Reuters, August 2016Table 1.1: EU exports and imports of goods to and from China 2010–2015(billions of euros)

The rise in sales of services to China couldbe application of the principle of comparative advantage and it could be argued that the EU should specialise in services and China in steel. If the size of China's exports of steel to the EU has resulted from dumping, however, this does not suggest lower opportunity costs in steel making in China. There are also strategic reasons for maintaining steel making in the EU.

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

        Question: Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

Persistent surpluses on the balance of trade in goods and services could increase aggregate demand in Malaysia leading to high employment and a rise in real GDP. This is a positive outcome, but it could generate demand-pull inflation if the economy is operating at full capacity. In addition, if the surpluses are maintained through government intervention there might be tension with trading partners and competitors. This might lead to retaliation.

        Question: Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Fig. 1.1 Vietnam's current account balance, Q1 2016 to Q2 2018 (US$ million)
Source: tradingeconomics.com, accessed October 2019
Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

        Question: Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Discuss two factors that will determine the extent of the impact the EU tariffs will have on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia. For each relevant factor identified (1 mark) explained (1 mark) and developed to show the impact on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia (1 mark) e.g. The ped of rice (from Myanmar and Cambodia in the EU) (1 mark). If the demand is price inelastic this means that the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in QD (1 mark). Therefore, the exports of Myanmar and Cambodia may not significantly reduce (1 mark) Two factors required (2 × 3 marks)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

        Question: Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.
