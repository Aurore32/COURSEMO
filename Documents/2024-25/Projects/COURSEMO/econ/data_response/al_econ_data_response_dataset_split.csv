0,"The threat from large firms
In 2021, one of the largest United States (US) technology companies averaged sales of US$1.2 billion a day. It took less than four seconds to earn US$52000, the average American yearly salary. Three of the largest technology companies reported record breaking sales and profits. Five of the largest companies made combined profits of over US$68 billion. 
They were helped by the Covid-19 pandemic that caused a huge increase in online working and shopping. The ability to work and shop online was greatly welcomed by many who were forced to stay at home.
Critics, however, worry that if this trend to large firms continues the future will be controlled by a handful of super-rich, super-powerful companies. They will dominate economic activity. This is not just bad for the economy; it is bad for consumers and bad for competition. Also, economic concentration causes unacceptable inequality. One powerful firm tried to prevent workers joining a trade union.
Their huge cash reserves mean that they could undercut possible new entrants and prevent competition. Investors will be wary of investing in possible competitors and new owners would be prepared to sell out to the dominant firms rather than try and compete.
The size of the firm gives it political power to fight any official or government intervention. Governments are beginning to be aware of this. The chair of the US body that deals with competition law said there was a range of potential risks created by the large companies. The government is aware of their ability to avoid paying taxes and their ability to dominate allows them to expand into markets for similar products.
Ten years ago, a co-founder of one of the large firms said ‘Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who used the term creative destruction would be proud’. But now that co-founder is not so sure. ‘We went from being pirates to being the navy. People may love pirates when they are young and small, but nobody likes a navy that acts like a pirate. Today’s technology giants are just like that’.

",Distinguish between limit pricing and predatory pricing. [4],"a.i

Distinguish between limit pricing and predatory pricing.
Limit Pricing is a strategy used by the existing supplier to restrict the entry of new entrants into the market. The existing firm sets a price low enough to prevent new entrants considering it a worthwhile market in which to try and compete. They set a price possibly close to average cost so that just normal profit is made. (2)
Predatory pricing by contrast is a strategy which is used by one supplier to force another supplier already in the market to leave the market. They set a price below unit cost in the short run to drive out competition. Then later raise prices to recover those losses. It is considered anti-competitive and is illegal under their anti-trust laws. (2)

The article says the growth of large firms is bad for consumers, bad for competition, and causes inequality.
Consider whether this statement can be supported by the article or by economic theory.
In support: Article mentions profit compared with salaries, restriction on union membership, avoidance of tax, expansion into adjacent markets.
Theory: Growth of firms can lead to less choice, higher prices, restricted output, higher profits. This is supported by the article and by theory. It can be detrimental for consumers and detrimental for competition. Monopolies can be formed, small firms forced out of the market. (4 marks for support)
Against the statement: Article mentions consumers working/staying at home and welcoming the service the firms provide.
Theory: Large firms can also have economies of scale, can reduce prices, can encourage innovation and research. This is not mentioned in the article but is supported by economic theory. (4 marks for against the statement)
Conclusion: statement is not therefore always true. (1 mark)

4,"Reduced Migration to the United States (US)
The factors of production land, labour, capital and enterprise form the basis for all economic output. Whilst land is geographically fixed, the other factors of production, for example labour, are mobile. Large numbers of migrants move from country to country every year. Many migrate to the US. 
The average increase in the number of migrants working in the US was 0.6 million per year until 2018. However, the Covid-19 restrictions in place since 2019 prevented migration and by 2022 the total number of migrants working in the US was nearly 2 million lower than expected.
Half of migrants initially come as students, to be college educated, often in science-based subjects. Post-graduation, they often remain to work in the high-tech industries, before many return to their home countries with enhanced skills. 
Well-educated immigrants are three times more likely to start businesses than inhabitants of the US. The reduction in the number of new migrants would reduce the number of new businesses and this, in turn, would reduce job creation by an estimated 200000.
The remaining non-college educated migrants work mainly in lower-paid sectors such as retail and agriculture. They also play an important role in industries such as hospitality and food-related services. Many of the migrants send money to family members who remain in their home countries.

Mexicans and Central Americans form the largest share of migrants, at over 35% of the total. Average incomes in their home countries are between 10% and 20% of the US average. There is also significant unemployment and under-employment in their home countries. In the US, migrants earn on average 12% less than the average wage for all workers. This varies by ethnic origin: Hispanic workers earn 16% less than the average while white workers earn 15% more than average.

As the rate of unfilled jobs increases the foreign-born share of employment increases. (1) They are directly proportional. (1)
This suggests that the US uses immigrants to fill labour shortages. (1)Immigrants will be drawn to those occupations where there are most vacancies. (1)
Some jobs with the high foreign-born share rate and high unfilled job rate may be regarded as ‘starter’ jobs (1) which are taken initially whilst looking for something better. (1)

Using the information and labour market theory, analyse why the wages received by migrant workers in the high-tech industries are likely to be higher than the wages received by migrant workers in the hospitality industry.
Demand:Theory suggests that the MPP of the educated will be higher than unskilled/less educated. (1)The value of the output of the educated will be greater than the less educated (1) anddemand will be higher resulting in higher wages (1).
Some college educated become entrepreneurs in high-tech industries and gain the benefits of profits which can be very high. (1)There may be prejudice against less educated workers which is reflected in their pay. (1)
Supply:The increase in immigrants has fallen and this may cause the wage gap for the low paid to narrow (1) and for the educated to widen. (1)

Evaluate the likely impact of a return to the migration levels prior to 2019 on the macroeconomic performance of the US economy.
Increase supply of labour and therefore aggregate supply will increase. This may stabilise prices. (1 + 1)
There will also be a rise in aggregate demand as migrants spend their income. Migrants likely to have a high MPC, therefore strong Multiplier Effect. (1 + 1)
Payment of remittances will decrease X-M and worsen the B of P. (1 +1)
US domestic employment will increase because immigrants set up new businesses. (1 +1)
Crowding out argument: immigrant labour takes jobs of domestic workers - needs a rational argument to support this. (2)

8,"Will an increase in exports lead Sri Lanka back into economic growth?
In May 2022, Sri Lanka had to admit that it was unable to pay its debts to other countries for the first time in its history. As a result, in February 2023 it was forced to obtain a loan of US$3bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The question is now, can Sri Lanka trade its way out of trouble?
The main problem faced by Sri Lanka for many years has been a lack of international competitiveness. Despite a growth in exports between 2000 and 2018, over the same period, they fell as a share of the economy from 39% to 23% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As a result, the country has found itself unable to earn enough foreign currency to pay for essential imports of food and fuel.

For many years, Sri Lanka has enjoyed a comparative advantage in growing and exporting tea. However, the ban on imports of fertilisers in 2021 which cut yields by a fifth and an overreliance on outdated methods of production have had a disastrous impact. Another major export is textiles, but these rely heavily on imported raw materials that have rapidly increased in price following the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. So, what alternatives exist for Sri Lanka?
Unlike in other Asian nations, Sri Lanka does not appear to have a plan to develop any new comparative advantage. Probably the most likely option would appear to be to take full use of its position at the centre of Indian Ocean shipping lanes by developing its ports. Sri Lanka could become a major shipping hub which would extend opportunities for exports. For example, approximately a third of the world’s oil is transported across the Indian Ocean. 
Other options include allowing the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate to boost exports because it is felt that the currency is overvalued. There are also suggestions that all import tariffs should be removed. Sri Lanka is currently one of the most protected economies in the World and removing tariffs may help attract much needed foreign investment and encourage local industries to become more efficient.
The question now is, could the introduction of these options lead Sri Lanka back into economic growth?

As a result, in February 2023 it was forced to obtain a loan of US$3bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The question is now, can Sri Lanka trade its way out of trouble?
The main problem faced by Sri Lanka for many years has been a lack of international competitiveness. Despite a growth in exports between 2000 and 2018, over the same period, they fell as a share of the economy from 39% to 23% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As a result, the country has found itself unable to earn enough foreign currency to pay for essential imports of food and fuel.

For many years, Sri Lanka has enjoyed a comparative advantage in growing and exporting tea. However, the ban on imports of fertilisers in 2021 which cut yields by a fifth and an overreliance on outdated methods of production have had a disastrous impact. Another major export is textiles, but these rely heavily on imported raw materials that have rapidly increased in price following the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. So, what alternatives exist for Sri Lanka?
Unlike in other Asian nations, Sri Lanka does not appear to have a plan to develop any new comparative advantage. Probably the most likely option would appear to be to take full use of its position at the centre of Indian Ocean shipping lanes by developing its ports. Sri Lanka could become a major shipping hub which would extend opportunities for exports. For example, approximately a third of the world’s oil is transported across the Indian Ocean. 
Other options include allowing the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate to boost exports because it is felt that the currency is overvalued. There are also suggestions that all import tariffs should be removed. Sri Lanka is currently one of the most protected economies in the World and removing tariffs may help attract much needed foreign investment and encourage local industries to become more efficient.
The question now is, could the introduction of these options lead Sri Lanka back into economic growth?

14,"French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

Is there any evidence in the article that the French government’s decisions will increase competition or efficiency in the energy market?
Competitors got cheaper electricity, so this maybe increases competition (1). Alternative renewable energy projects were stopped, so possibly leading to less efficiency (1). Five reactors were forced to close due to poor maintenance and becoming less efficient (1). The reactors enabled selfsufficiency so this is now less likely. Conclusion: some evidence of increasing competition, no evidence of increasing efficiency (1). Accept fall in monopoly profits might lead to a fall in dynamic efficiency (1).

Consider whether the actions of the French government on electricity prices might be thought to increase either equality or equity for consumers and producers.
Cannot show that changes in price are linked to any notion of fairness, in relation to producer (1). Therefore, producer equity will be unaffected (1). A tax cut might increase consumer equity (1). Explanation (1) equality possibly, consumer rescued from excessive price increase (1) but as both rich and poor consumer benefit it is not conclusive that consumer equality is improved (1). Small firms will get cheaper electricity at the expense of large firms and this suggests an increase in equality between producers might be obtained (2). However, a cut in electricity taxes might benefit the large electricity company more than its smaller rivals, therefore any conclusion on the impact of equality for producers might remain uncertain (2).

18,"Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a form of technological progress. It involves computers or computercontrolled robots engaging in tasks usually performed by humans. Many businesses invest in AI to reduce their costs, to increase their efficiency by reducing human errors and to raise business revenues and profits.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process – from increased use of contactless card payment systems to large-scale investment in driverless taxis. In China, a leading internet search company plans to follow some of its rivals in the United States (US) by starting a driverless taxi service in 100 cities by 2030.
Nevertheless, the pace of growth in AI has raised concerns that this will result in increased unemployment. One study suggests that up to 38% of US jobs are at risk from automation by the mid-2030s. To date, Japan has between 200 and 300 AI companies. It is also the leading supplier of industrial robots and third, behind China and the US, in spending on research and development into AI.
Just a few years ago, the growth of the internet created similar fears. Despite these concerns, the technology created millions of jobs and contributed as much as 10.5% towards US GDP in 2020. As a result, some economists suggest that the movement towards AI will fundamentally change the world and the way we work and live but will not lead to large rises in unemployment. AI technology may create more jobs than it destroys.
Nonetheless, the danger remains that automation will lead to a society of winners and losers. These newly created jobs will require new skills and significant investment in training young people and retraining adults. Therefore, governments may need to implement targeted policies to ensure that any changes to structural unemployment are only short-lived. However, rising national debt alongside projections of low economic growth, as shown in Table 1.1, may reduce the ability of governments to deliver such policies.

23,"The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.

The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.
For South Africa’s economy to grow it needs to address major infrastructure issues. Also, in disadvantaged communities the education system is weak contributing to a skills shortage and a rise in the unemployment rate to 27% (see Fig. 1.2). Increased production is further hindered by restrictive trade union practices.

An analyst said: ‘A critical reason for low economic growth has been a lack of private sector investment and FDI (see Fig. 1.3). The lack of investment wasn’t just due to the political policies but also to uncertainty and mismanagement which led to continued inequalities.’

Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy.
Various government reforms and poor performances of some state industries have undermined confidence in the entire South African economy. (1)
This can be illustrated by the lack of investment by the private sector in the mining industry leading to increasing unemployment. (1)
The South African economy has also been diminished in the international economy as indicated by the fall in FDI (Figure 3) (1)
High unemployment means low consumer expenditure and low growth in AD. (1)
Future prospects for improvement seem limited in the short run (1). Longer term it needs to overcome a skills shortage by reforming education (1) and restrictive trade union practices. (1) Nevertheless, there is some increase in FDI (1). Longer term increase in infrastructure (1). An increase in employment/economic growth in the economy (1)

In 2020, Japan suffered its third quarterly decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in a row. The size of its real GDP shrank to its lowest level since 2011 when the country was suffering from 20 years of deflation and economic stagnation. In 2020, the economy was not helped by a previous increase in sales tax, the COVID-19 pandemic and the trade war between the world's biggest economies, the United States (US) and China. They were Japan's two most significant trading partners; 19.9% of exports went to the US and 19% to China. Table 1.1 gives some economic indicators for Japan for selected years.

In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the global economy was facing its worst recession since the world depression in the 1930s. Japan's economy shrank by 7.8% between April and June of 2020, while the US economy contracted by 9.5% and China's by 3.2%.
Japan, which was the world's fourth largest exporter, incurred an overall trade deficit of US$15.2 billion for 2019, an increase of almost 50% on the trade deficit for 2018. In 2020, exports fell by a further 18.5% in the third quarter, mainly caused by a decline in Japan's motor vehicle exports. In that quarter, its main car producer, one of the world's biggest car companies, made its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as sales halved. 
The government of Japan used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to try to stimulate the economy. Low interest rates had been used by the central bank since 2016. In August 2020, economists said that despite this stimulus to encourage growth there was a chance economic activity may stagnate even further if major nations again adopted more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to combat any reoccurrence of the pandemic.

In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)
In theory the low interest rates should discourage saving and increased consumption but the pattern of retail sales seems to contradict this expectation. (2)
Also, low interest rates should encourage borrowing for industrial investment to expand capital assets but industrial production has declined significantly after 2017 (2)
Policy appears to have worked best in 2017 when industrial production and retail sales improved significantly linked to the highest rate of economic growth year-on-year.
However the fall in exports, trade wars (US − China) and high levels of public debt have continued to lead to more stagnation. This has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 (2)

It has also been the first economy to recover from recession, a period of two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The Chinese government was quick to enforce lockdowns to limit the pandemic and there was rapidly increasing demand for exports of PPE (personal protection equipment) and other Chinese-made products. 
The case of neighbouring South Korea was different. Like China, the impact of the pandemic was more effectively contained than in other economies and growth in South Korea’s economy was less affected. There was, however, little evidence in the data that by the end of 2020, South Korea’s economy would recover to its pre-2019 position of strong economic growth. 
The economies of the US and the UK had negative quarterly economic growth throughout 2020. Economists in these countries have disagreed about how best to increase the rate of economic growth after the pandemic. The governments of both countries introduced very high government spending programmes to encourage the return to economic growth in 2021. However, monetary policies have been widely promoted by many economists as an alternative to more traditional fiscal measures.

34,"Varied responses to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic had a very significant impact on the global economy in 2020. Negative economic growth rates were recorded for all major economies. The speed, unexpected and unprecedented nature of the downturns has been devastating for businesses, governments and populations. Individual economies reacted to the pandemic differently. Fig. 1.1 shows quarterly economic growth rates in 2020 for four selected countries compared to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) average.

Fig. 1.1 Annual change to quarterly gross domestic product (GDP)in selected countries in 2020 compared to the OECD average.
China's economic performance in 2020 was the exception. China was the first country to experience the pandemic. It has also been the first economy to recover from recession, a period of two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The Chinese government was quick to enforce lockdowns to limit the pandemic and there was rapidly increasing demand for exports of PPE (personal protection equipment) and other Chinese-made products. 
The case of neighbouring South Korea was different. Like China, the impact of the pandemic was more effectively contained than in other economies and growth in South Korea’s economy was less affected. There was, however, little evidence in the data that by the end of 2020, South Korea’s economy would recover to its pre-2019 position of strong economic growth. 
The economies of the US and the UK had negative quarterly economic growth throughout 2020. Economists in these countries have disagreed about how best to increase the rate of economic growth after the pandemic. The governments of both countries introduced very high government spending programmes to encourage the return to economic growth in 2021. However, monetary policies have been widely promoted by many economists as an alternative to more traditional fiscal measures.

36,"Electric cars create challenges for oil producers
Oil companies are facing uncertainty in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic causes a collapse in demand for their product, but car producers are predicting the pandemic will help accelerate the use of electric cars. Looking ahead, cuts in investment by oil companies as their revenues fall could reduce supply enough to cause a rise in oil prices. This makes electric cars more attractive just as car producers increase production.

However, the rise of electric car sales could slow within the next few years due to a worldwide shortage of the supply of lithium needed for car batteries. Demand for lithium could triple by 2025 to one million tonnes per year and then double again to two million tonnes per year by 2030. A typical lithium mine produces 30000 tonnes per year which means the market needs approximately four new mines per year to meet demand. However, it usually takes about six years to discover, develop and put a lithium mine into production.
Rising global sales of electric cars are impacting on world oil producers. The boom years for the oil industry are over as economies start to deal with climate change. This will have significant implications for petrostates (countries whose economies are almost totally reliant on oil and gas). 
Volatile oil prices, as illustrated in Table 1.1, have already left many petrostate governments struggling. The governments of most Middle Eastern oil producing countries cannot maintain a balanced budget at the 2020 average oil price of around US$40. Years of unstable oil revenues have left these countries with significant levels of national debt.
Venezuela offers a cautionary tale. Serious mismanagement has caused its oil output in 2020 to drop to about 10% of its 2000 level. Gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen by more than 75% in the past 5 years and more than 5 million people have left the country.
The solution is diversification. Wealthy Middle East states, such as Oman and Saudi Arabia, are investing in renewable energy and international tourism. Attempts at change by less wealthy petrostates such as Venezuela are hampered by a lack of capital at home and because they are often unable to attract international investors. As a result, they tend to focus on short-term rather than long-term economic growth.
Ultimately, many petrostates are likely to need outside support to diversify their economies. In addition to financial aid, it is suggested that wealthy countries should also offer technical assistance such as retraining workers, help designing new tax systems and support with the adoption of renewable energy.

With the help of a diagram, explain why the supply problem referred to may lead to increases in the price of electric cars in the future and consider one policy that may be used to overcome this supply problem.
The shortage of lithium may be caused by a fall in its supply or an increase in its demand (not matched by an increase in its supply). For an accurate supply and demand diagram showing the effect on the price of lithium and/or the price of electric cars due to either of these changes (1) explaining that this will add to the cost of production of electric cars (1) and therefore increase the price of electric cars (1).
IF an accurate supply and demand diagram is drawn to illustrate the increase in the price of electric cars without any reference to the price of lithium and its importance as a cost of production then 1 mark MAX.
Clearly there are several potential valid policies, but these must clearly address the problems identified in the data i.e., a worldwide shortage in the supply of lithium needed for car batteries in electric vehicles. Evaluation must therefore focus on increasing the supply of lithium and not electric cars and methods may include:

R and D into alternative raw materials other than lithium or improve its extraction
Tax and subsidy incentives to increase R and D
Tax and subsidy incentives to increase the number of lithium mines.

Identify and explain valid policy and briefly explain how that this might overcome the problem of a lack of lithium (1)

and reaches a justified conclusion as to which country's economic growth is most likely to be impacted.

GuidanceClearly, according to the extract, the common problem for both economies is the forecast fall in oil demand led by the need to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change. However, as the data also makes clear, the impact of this will be different for countries such as Saudi Arabia and countries such as Venezuela, and the analysis and evaluation must refer to these differences for full marks. Points to consider from the extract may include:

The relative wealth and access to both internal and external capital
The relative focus on short- and long-term growth
The relative ease of diversifying e.g., Saudi Arabia has already begun investing in renewable energy and tourism, whereas Venezuela is suffering high rates of emigration and lacks the funds to do so.

41,"Economic growth in Taiwan
In 2021, Taiwan's economy is forecast to grow at its fastest rate in seven years, encouraged by increasing global demand for its technology products. Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise by 4.6% in 2021.
Exports from Taiwan's electronics industry include gaming devices, laptops, devices that aid cloud computing and semiconductors for car production. Taiwan is able to take advantage of a global shortage of semiconductors and it is estimated that exports will grow by 9.6% in 2021, the strongest export growth since 2017. A Taiwanese company is the world's largest producer of semiconductors, and it plans to increase its capital investment by as much as US$28 billion in 2021 to help meet the shortage of semiconductors.
Consumption expenditure in Taiwan is also expected to grow by 3.7% in 2021 which would be the fastest rate of growth in 17 years.

43,"Economic growth in Taiwan
In 2021, Taiwan's economy is forecast to grow at its fastest rate in seven years, encouraged by increasing global demand for its technology products. Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise by 4.6% in 2021.
Exports from Taiwan's electronics industry include gaming devices, laptops, devices that aid cloud computing and semiconductors for car production. Taiwan is able to take advantage of a global shortage of semiconductors and it is estimated that exports will grow by 9.6% in 2021, the strongest export growth since 2017. A Taiwanese company is the world's largest producer of semiconductors, and it plans to increase its capital investment by as much as US$28 billion in 2021 to help meet the shortage of semiconductors.
Consumption expenditure in Taiwan is also expected to grow by 3.7% in 2021 which would be the fastest rate of growth in 17 years. 
It is significant that the expected growth in GDP in 2021 is higher than the expected rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI), as is shown in Table 1.1.

46,"Pakistan and the Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI)
The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.
Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.
Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.
The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).

Firms are sometimes thought of as machines: inputs go in, products come out. However, it matters how powerful these firms are allowed to become.
Competition law – the law that governs how firms compete in the market, how they may exert their power and how and when they may join forces – has not prevented high concentration ratios in many industries.
Global monopolies have been created in the name of ‘free market’ capitalism. Mergers have been approved and monopolies tolerated under the assumption that they are efficient. Their ability to enable innovation is relied upon to justify these monopolised industries.
Competition law is being used to protect a narrow set of public interests based on the idea of ‘consumer welfare’. The test applied by the law is whether any change will result in lower prices for consumers and thus is beneficial. This is regardless of how monopolised the resulting market structure becomes.
The logic that focuses on consumer prices is flawed. This can be seen in the impacts of firms on the environment. Prices do not capture the negative externalities of production, for which neither the producer nor the consumer pays. 
Low consumer prices are not an adequate indicator for consumer welfare. The low price/low wage spiral keeps pushing for cheaper goods and services to increase the profitability of the firm. The result is that workers are paid less. Low prices cause unequal bargaining positions between powerful employers and workers, and between powerful buyers and small independent suppliers.
Regulation has a role to play in protecting consumers from the worst abuses of market power by firms. There needs, however, to be new competition law that promotes the free market rather than the desires of the monopoly firms. It needs to consider the balance of power between the public sector and private enterprise.

The article refers to concentration ratios. Explain what is meant by a concentration ratio and how it is calculated.
The concentration ratio is the sum of the market share percentage held by the largest specified number of firms in an industry. It ranges from 0% to 100%, and an indicates the degree of competition in the industry. Low concentration ratio in an industry would indicate greater competition among the firms in that industry. (2)
It is calculated by adding together the total sales for each of the specified number of largest firms in the industry. (E.g. a 4 firm concentration ration takes the sales of the largest 4 firms) That sum is then divided by the total sales of the industry and converted to a percentage. (2)

Overall, sales of doughnuts fell in 2020 and are forecast to remain below their 2019 peak into 2021. Reasons for this fall in demand are that consumers are making fewer shopping trips and in cities, more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack.
In the United Kingdom (UK), more so than in the US, there are growing concerns about the increase in sugar consumption amongst children. This increase comes from soft drinks, chocolate biscuits and sweets (candy) as well as from jam-filled doughnuts, all of which are widely available in supermarkets and local convenience stores. In 2021, it was estimated that a third of teenagers and two thirds of adults in the UK were overweight. This has increased the pressure on the UK government to end online advertising of a range of products including doughnuts. It has been estimated that viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories. Moreover, a ban on advertising sugary foods would result in children consuming the equivalent of 62 million fewer doughnuts a year in the UK.

60,"Is Nigeria being held back by its dependence on oil and gas?
Nigeria has about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of young people in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic, particularly due to the steep decline in oil prices. Nationally, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, while another 25% are vulnerable and could fall into poverty due to the pandemic.
Oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria’s export revenues, a dominant position that it has occupied since the 1970s. Many people believe that Nigeria needs to move further away from its dependence on oil and natural gas. Initial attempts at diversification have produced limited gains as the policies have been aimed mainly at the domestic market to create jobs and to improve living standards. There needs to be a focus on export‑orientated manufacturing that should boost economic growth as it has done in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
Based on the experience of these countries, more open trade and competition policies would help to diversify the economy, especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) takes effect. Nigeria needs to create at least five million new jobs each year to employ its growing population of young people.

Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 2020 due to fall in crude oil prices caused by falling global demand and measures to fight the spread of COVID‑19. Inflation rose in 2020 due mainly to higher food prices, the removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in the price of electricity. The budget deficit also worsened in 2020 because the COVID‑19 pandemic caused higher government spending and lower tax revenues, adding to the national debt.
Nigeria’s national debt is sustainable at 25% of GDP, but interest payments are high, accounting for about 50% of government spending. Nigeria’s government could improve its finances by reforming domestic tax collection. Non‑oil tax revenue is equivalent to just 4% of GDP. An increase in the rate of value‑added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 resulted in less revenue than forecast because of the recession. A wider tax base could help the budget, but this will require significant reform to reduce both tax evasion and a large informal economy.

",Consider the extent to which the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria would lead to an increase in inflation. [4] ,"c

Consider the extent to which the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria would lead to an increase in inflation.

For an explanation of why the removal of subsidies is likely to lead to an increase in the price of fuel e.g., by increasing the cost of producing and / or supplying fuel or by shifting the supply curve to the left to its original position. (1)
For an explanation of why this is likely to lead to an increase in inflation / a rise in the price level e.g., fuel will have a high weighting in the measurement of inflation / PED is likely to be inelastic/ it is an important cost of production that affects the price of many other products / it may lead to cost-push inflation. (1)
For an explanation of why this may lead to continuing inflation e.g., as price rises, wage demands fuel further inflation / may lead to an increase in the price level for a much wider range of products. (1)

For some evaluation of the overall impact e.g., the inflationary impact may be offset by the fact that: (1)

there is a reduction in other costs/prices OR
PED may in fact be elastic leading to a fall in demand and therefore prices rise but at a lower rate OR
It also may depend on the size of the original subsidy.

Accept any other valid reason why the inflationary impact may be offset.

64,"Is Nigeria being held back by its dependence on oil and gas?
Nigeria has about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of young people in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic, particularly due to the steep decline in oil prices. Nationally, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, while another 25% are vulnerable and could fall into poverty due to the pandemic.
Oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria’s export revenues, a dominant position that it has occupied since the 1970s. Many people believe that Nigeria needs to move further away from its dependence on oil and natural gas. Initial attempts at diversification have produced limited gains as the policies have been aimed mainly at the domestic market to create jobs and to improve living standards. There needs to be a focus on export‑orientated manufacturing that should boost economic growth as it has done in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
Based on the experience of these countries, more open trade and competition policies would help to diversify the economy, especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) takes effect. Nigeria needs to create at least five million new jobs each year to employ its growing population of young people.

Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 2020 due to fall in crude oil prices caused by falling global demand and measures to fight the spread of COVID‑19. Inflation rose in 2020 due mainly to higher food prices, the removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in the price of electricity. The budget deficit also worsened in 2020 because the COVID‑19 pandemic caused higher government spending and lower tax revenues, adding to the national debt.
Nigeria’s national debt is sustainable at 25% of GDP, but interest payments are high, accounting for about 50% of government spending. Nigeria’s government could improve its finances by reforming domestic tax collection. Non‑oil tax revenue is equivalent to just 4% of GDP. An increase in the rate of value‑added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 resulted in less revenue than forecast because of the recession. A wider tax base could help the budget, but this will require significant reform to reduce both tax evasion and a large informal economy.

Fig. 1.1: India's unemployment rate, July 2020 to May 2021 
India's unemployment rate rose in December 2020, reaching a six-month high. The fact that the unemployment rate has been rising during this period, despite an economic recovery, has raised concerns among economists at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) research institute in Mumbai, although they recognise that there are possible difficulties in the measurement of unemployment.
One of the reasons for the increase in unemployment in December 2020 is an increase in frictional unemployment. According to CMIE, India’s labour force increased from 421 million in November 2020 to 427 million in December 2020 and the majority of these new workers were unable to find work immediately. Many of these people are reluctant to relocate to take jobs and others are unaware of job vacancies. 
Another reason for this increase in unemployment in India is because of seasonal unemployment. One of the main reasons behind rising unemployment has been the failure of the agricultural sector to absorb the additional labour. One economist at CMIE has stated: ‘Farming is the last resort of many who are without work. However, December is not the month in which farming can absorb labour. This is the month when it needs fewer workers. In December 2020, the job losses from agriculture were 9.8 million. 
The economists at CMIE stated that the rise in unemployment in certain months was not a good sign for the Indian economy as it could lead to higher income inequality and poverty.

70,"Increasing public sector debt is a good policy
Politicians do not usually think it a success to borrow a large amount of money but, in June 2020, when the economy was approaching a recession, the United Kingdom (UK) borrowed five times as much as it did in June 2019. This made the government debt only just a little less than the total size of the economy. The ratio of public sector debt to gross domestic product (GDP) was 99.6%. It was the highest figure for 60 years. Public sector net borrowing is shown in Fig. 1.

Borrowing is what the government ought to be doing in a recession in order to finance the spending used to boost aggregate demand. The question in 2020 was how long could the borrowing of such large amounts continue? There can be problems with a large public sector debt. An expansion of government borrowing might increase interest rates if investors require more compensation because they think the risk of holding government bonds has increased. This interest rate rise would affect the rest of the economy.
There is also a theoretical objection that government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector, especially when the economy is close to its productive capacity and unemployment of resources is low. This would not happen when there are unemployed resources in a recession. 
The UK Finance Minister suggested that a high ratio of public sector debt to GDP was justified; it is the stability of the ratio that is important. This reasoning can be justified. Reducing government spending in order to reduce borrowing would risk stopping any recovery and make the situation worse. Economic recovery is necessary to restore economic activity, which in turn will restore the government's finances.
However, economists cannot know with any precision what the limits of public sector borrowing should be. For many years, Japan has maintained a ratio of public sector debt to GDP of over 200% with no difficulty. But what is suitable for Japan may not be suitable in a different type of economy.

Consider what is meant by the phrase 'government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector.
'Crowding out' idea is that the growth of government spending will lead to a transfer of scarce resources, or finance, from the private to the public sector. (2)
If the government borrows to fund the expenditure it may have to sell bonds to the private sector (1). Encouraging the private sector to buy bonds may require higher interest rates (1) or prevent the private sector using the money for other projects.

74,"Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Explain why a profit-maximising retailer might be interested in the link between consumers’ loyalty and price elasticity of demand.

Loyalty will mean consumers do not change suppliers, this might create a lower price elasticity of demand. (1)
Define price elasticity. (1)
Explain the link between elasticity and revenue (1); explain the link between changes in revenue and profits, depending on cost changes. (1)

76,"Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts.
Evidence from the article for the effectiveness of using loyalty cards:

loyalty cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions (1)
retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through loyalty cards. (1)

In contrast to that the article says:

price is not the most significant factor in determining choice (1)
there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit or has low emotional involvement. (1)

Conclusion: there does seem to be some conflicting evidence. (1)

78,"Vietnam's 'Economic Miracle'
Thirty years ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. Since then, its real GDP has increased rapidly. A series of economic and political reforms has been responsible for its so-called 'economic miracle'. 
Vietnam has benefitted from the increased protectionism in trade between China and the United States (US). For example, Vietnam has increased production of goods that are substitutes to those made in China to such an extent that Vietnam is popularly referred to as 'China plus one', in recognition of its similar comparative advantage to China. 
Rising export revenue is only one reason for Vietnam's spectacular economic growth. With a rapidly growing population, Vietnam has invested heavily in its human capital and physical capital in the form of infrastructure, including cheap access to the internet. 
A third reason for this success is how Vietnam has moved towards trade liberalisation. This is shown through its free trade agreement with the US and its membership of organisations of countries that have agreed to trade freely with each other, such as ASEAN and the TPP. These initiatives involve the removal of tariffs and other tools of protection, increasing the potential for Vietnam to trade with other countries.
Nevertheless, there are possible dangers in this strategy. Vietnam's economy is heavily dependent on its exports which in 2017 were over 90% of GDP. This reliance puts Vietnam at risk from downturns in the global economy and in the economies of its main trading partners. Even more worrying is the repeated threat from the US that it may put import tariffs on manufactured goods from Vietnam.

84,"The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil
Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland. 
Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt. 
Nations producing palm oil view it as a means of reducing poverty, while international finance organisations regard it as an engine of growth for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) encouraged Malaysia and Indonesia to cultivate natural resources and to produce more palm oil in spite of an awareness of high external costs. Dutch banks provided more than US$12 billion in loans to Indonesian producers. Palm oil is Indonesia’s main export earner. 
Widespread adoption of palm oil began when, in 1995, one of the world's major multinational companies decided to use it in its global food manufacturing industries instead of animal fats and other vegetable oils, which were then said to be unhealthy. It invested heavily in expanding palm oil plantations in Malaysia and achieved considerable cost savings because palm oil has a much higher yield per hectare than other vegetable oils.
Palm oil's versatility is not limited to food. It is used in 70% of personal care products (toiletries) such as soap, shampoo and make-up. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel fuel.
As the palm oil industry expanded, conservationists began to raise the alarm about the devastating effects from carbon emissions and on wildlife habitats. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of some rare animals. 
In 2019, one supermarket promised to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. Norway banned imports for biodiesel production. The European Parliament proposed that public subsidies for biodiesel should be removed by 2021. If this proposal is enacted it will affect the demand for biodiesel and may force palm oil producing countries to reduce deforestation programmes, leading to improved environmental sustainability.

Widespread adoption of palm oil began when, in 1995, one of the world's major multinational companies decided to use it in its global food manufacturing industries instead of animal fats and other vegetable oils, which were then said to be unhealthy.

The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of some rare animals. 
In 2019, one supermarket promised to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. Norway banned imports for biodiesel production.

87,"The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil
Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland. 
Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt.

To what extent do you agree with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to encourage Indonesia to expand its production of palm oil?
In support of the advice: Indonesia was suffering from external debt problems and the IMF advocated expansion of a big earner of forex to eliminate this debt with positive outcomes for growth of incomes in-country. Plus any relevant positive effects identified. (4 max)
The disadvantage was the devastation of rain forests to increase land area for oil palms. Fires increase greenhouse gas emissions (global warming) and destroy habitats. External costs will exceed private costs of plantation owners. Danger of monoculture – prices influenced by foreign buyers – could result in job losses eventually if foreign trade is reduced. (4 max)
Conclusion: Although Europe may reduce its demand, increasing demands in India, China and Indonesia will be critical. Palm oil can be seen as both a positive benefit and a negative impact with a high social cost. Environmentally production is unsustainable at present rate of expansion. [1] (8 max total)

88,"Romania's economy booms
Romania, like other former planned economies in eastern Europe has increased the amount of private enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in its economy. Romania's economy has boomed in recent years and compares favourably with economies in the European Union (EU) as indicated in Fig. 1.1.

This economic boom has been characterised by the expansion of services and manufacturing sectors. In particular the high-tech industries have been very successful and are expected to double their contribution to GDP to 12% by 2025. The low wage rate in Romania was a benefit for foreign companies. For example, global car companies have, since 2008, invested US$1.4 billion in Romania’s car factories that has increased employment. 
After Romania joined the EU in 2007, many Romanian workers took advantage of the free movement of labour the EU allows. In 2008, 600000 out of a population of 21.2m left Romania. In spite of its economic boom, Romania has failed to attract sufficient workers back and there is now a shortage of labour. The total population is lower than in 2008 at 19.4m. Unemployment was only 5.9% in 2017 compared with an average rate of 8.6% for the EU as a whole. 
Since 2015, the government has taken measures to boost the economy. It reduced sales tax from 24% to 19%, which increased consumer demand. It also doubled the national minimum wage providing a boost for both private sector and public sector employment. 
But there are also serious economic challenges. The gap between government income and spending has widened causing a rising budget deficit. The transport infrastructure remains poor. In a World Economic Forum report in 2016, Romania was ranked 128th out of 138 countries for the quality of its road network and 79th for its railway system.

92,"Pakistan's agriculture survives on subsidies
As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

For an evaluation of whether agricultural subsidies should be paid to farmers if the country already has lower opportunity costs in other industries. (Up to 3 marks with 1 mark reserved for a conclusion)

The answer should consider the benefits of subsidies to farmers in terms of increasing their incomes and benefits to the economy in terms of reducing import dependence and keeping the prices of staple goods affordable. The evaluation should consider these benefits in countries that have lower opportunity costs in other areas of production e.g., may be an unnecessary burden on government expenditure, may invite retaliation, may restrict trade etc.

Extract 1: World export prices of maize fall sharply
Export prices of maize declined further in April 2020, with the United States (US) maize price nearly 10% down from April 2019. It is now at the lowest value in more than ten years. Large global supplies and good harvest prospects in South America continue to reduce prices. In addition, lower demand for maize from the biofuel and animal feed industries is depressing the price further.

Extract 2: Zimbabwe takes steps to curb the rise in maize prices
Despite a falling world price for maize, the price of this staple food in Zimbabwe has continued to increase and is now at an exceptionally high level. The increased price mostly results from continued weakness in Zimbabwe’s currency that has damaged the country’s ability to import maize. In addition, the sharply reduced harvest of maize in Zimbabwe resulted in low domestic supplies. In an effort to tackle the soaring prices, the government has implemented several policies. To increase market supplies, the government removed a ban on imports of certain types of maize. It also increased producer subsidies on maize by 40%. Poorer households should benefit from access to this subsidised maize.

Extract 3: Malawi raises guaranteed minimum price for maize 
Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture has released updated guaranteed prices for cereals produced on Malawi's farms in 2020. These are the minimum prices that farmers will receive for their crops. The guaranteed price for the food staple, maize, was raised by just over 10%. The government has begun purchasing maize at this increased price. This change in the minimum price is expected to increase the production of maize in 2020 and in the future to an average level of 3.7 million tonnes per year.

Extract 2 states that the two reasons are 'sustained weakness in Zimbabwe's currency' and the 'sharply reduced harvest'. These need to be identified and explained. Only accept valid reasons contained in extract 2 that explicitly refer to Zimbabwe. The explanation should develop into why this reason will cause the price of maize to rise in Zimbabwe.

Discuss, with the help of a diagram, whether a subsidy on maize production will always benefit both the producers of maize and poorer households in Zimbabwe equally.
For an accurately labelled diagram that shows the shift to the right of the supply curve and the fall in equilibrium price that benefits the consumer (1 mark) and the rise in price received by the producer (plus 1 mark) and for an evaluative comment that refers to and accurately explains the significance of at least one measure of elasticity on the benefit to the producer and / or the consumer. (1 mark) and reaches a justified conclusion that benefit may / may not be enjoyed equally. (1 mark)

4

The diagram should show a shift to the right of the supply curve and a fall in pricebenefitting consumers and the payment to producers shown as the vertical distance between the new supply curve and the old supply curve at the new price. For both marks for the diagram, the impact on the price paid by the consumer and the effective price received by the producer must be clearly shown.
The answer just requires a brief explanation that the extent of the benefit to producers and consumers depends mainly on PED e.g. if it is elastic then producers will gain more and if inelastic, consumers will. May also depend on PES and consumers gain more when PES is more elastic and vice versa.
Justified conclusion needed for final mark

The imposition of the maximum price will lead to a shortage of maize in the market. In the absence of equilibrium price another method of distributing maize will need to be found. This might lead to queuing, first come first served or illegal markets. A rationing system might alleviate the problems.

104,"Governments and markets
Prices, according to economists, are determined by supply and demand. In many times and places, however, prices have been set by governments. For example, in January 2020, the government of Argentina updated its list of maximum prices, setting guidelines for over 300 products. Consumers, via a smartphone app, can report any prices of these products that are above the maximum.
The World Bank has collected data on the extent to which the governments of developing economies have intervened in markets to set prices. Table 1.1 shows the results of this research.

Governments generally impose price controls for one of three reasons:

to redistribute income in an economy: maximum prices help the poor afford the necessities of life, whereas minimum prices support the livelihoods of farmers
to stabilise a market: governments use stocks to smooth fluctuations in the price of a commodity like cocoa, buying when there is excess supply in the market and selling when there is excess demand
to control inflation: maximum prices have been used in many countries

Many economists have been critical of the use of price controls by governments. In a market without government intervention, a product's price acts as a signal of its scarcity and an incentive to overcome scarcity. However, minimum prices can lead to food rotting in warehouses while maximum prices can lead to hoarding and black markets. 
Another reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be very unpopular. For example, in Santiago, the capital city of Chile, an increase in the minimum price on the public transport system led to widespread unrest in 2019. In the same year, the government of Iran decided to raise the minimum price of fuel sharply and suddenly, leading to a great deal of protest.
A representative of the World Bank has stated that one reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be hard to remove, expressing the view that 'it is better not to have them in the first place.'

Possible reasons could include:

the need to reduce the demand for fuel; an increase in the price could be effective if the PED for fuel is elastic
this could benefit the country's current account on the balance of payments if a substantial amount of fuel is imported, although Iran does have a large amount of crude oil reserves
this will encourage producers to increase the supply of fuel which will help them to increase their profits
an increase in producer profits could lead to a substantial increase in government revenue from the taxes on profits
if subsidies have been reduced, the money saved could be reallocated

Effective minimum price:

a minimum price in a market is where a price floor is established
to be effective, this needs to be above the equilibrium price
the equilibrium price in a market would be higher than would be the case if there was no government intervention
farmers are therefore guaranteed these prices
this is likely to have a positive effect on their incomes
it could lead to excess supply/surplus
this could lead to the possibility of food rotting in warehouses

Government action might help the workings of the price mechanism:

it can help to stabilise a market
stocks can be used to smooth fluctuations in the price of commodity, such as cocoa, avoiding/reducing large price variations
a government could buy stocks when there was an excess supply of a product in the market
a government could sell stocks when there was an excess demand for a product in the market

Government action might not help the workings of the price mechanism:

it could distort the market by not allowing prices to reflect changes in the conditions of demand for, and supply of, a product
the consideration of how such action by a government might not help the workings of the price mechanism can be discussed in relation to the different functions of the price mechanism, i.e. rationing, signalling and the transmission of preferences



"
108,"Governments and markets
Prices, according to economists, are determined by supply and demand. In many times and places, however, prices have been set by governments. For example, in January 2020, the government of Argentina updated its list of maximum prices, setting guidelines for over 300 products. Consumers, via a smartphone app, can report any prices of these products that are above the maximum.
The World Bank has collected data on the extent to which the governments of developing economies have intervened in markets to set prices. Table 1.1 shows the results of this research.

Governments generally impose price controls for one of three reasons:

to redistribute income in an economy: maximum prices help the poor afford the necessities of life, whereas minimum prices support the livelihoods of farmers
to stabilise a market: governments use stocks to smooth fluctuations in the price of a commodity like cocoa, buying when there is excess supply in the market and selling when there is excess demand
to control inflation: maximum prices have been used in many countries

Many economists have been critical of the use of price controls by governments. In a market without government intervention, a product's price acts as a signal of its scarcity and an incentive to overcome scarcity. However, minimum prices can lead to food rotting in warehouses while maximum prices can lead to hoarding and black markets. 
Another reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be very unpopular. For example, in Santiago, the capital city of Chile, an increase in the minimum price on the public transport system led to widespread unrest in 2019. In the same year, the government of Iran decided to raise the minimum price of fuel sharply and suddenly, leading to a great deal of protest.

The advantages of establishing a maximum price in a market in the form of a price ceiling:

the price will be lower than what would otherwise be the case if there was no government intervention
this would lead to a lower rate of inflation in an economy
this helps the poor afford the necessities of life
these could include essential foodstuffs, housing rents and transport
specific examples given include the price of foodstuffs, including bread in Benin and rice in Haiti

The disadvantages of establishing a maximum price in a market in the form of a price ceiling:

lower prices could stimulate demandpull inflation
the creation of a shortage as a result of the excess demand created in the market
hoarding
black/illegal markets which can charge relatively high prices
queuing or rationing
if the controls are not effective, it will not control inflation

109,"Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.

113,"Productivity in the G7 countries
The G7 is a group of countries that have some of the world's major advanced economies. Productivity in the G7 countries varies, as shown in Fig. 1.1 below, with United Kingdom (UK) performance as the base index of 100.

Fig. 1.1: Gross domestic product per hour worked, G7 countries, for 2015 and 2016
Productivity in the UK was one of the worst in the G7. Poor management practices and lower levels of skills in the workforce were the main reasons for the UK’s position. In low wage, high employment sectors of the UK economy, the performance compared unfavourably with five of the G7 countries. In retailing, the UK was 40% lower than the performance in the United States (US). In hospitality industries the UK had a 45% lower rate than France.
Tackling poor productivity is about innovation, investment and improving infrastructure as well as labour skills.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the US suggested that innovation is one of the keys to productivity differences among the G7 countries. Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.
In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.
There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK. This made some UK industries, such as car production, vulnerable. The central bank in the UK has stated that foreign owned car manufacturers in the UK invest heavily in R&D and their presence boosts the productivity of labour. It was thought this may change in the future.

117,"The changing market for avocados
The global consumption of avocados has increased in the last few years, particularly in the United States (US) but also in China and parts of Europe. This growth is largely due to the increasing popularity of ‘guacamole’ (smashed avocado) and the health benefits claimed for its regular consumption. The US is the largest importer of avocados with supplies coming mainly from Central and South American producers as shown in Fig. 1.1.
Source: Avacados show growth in volume, www.thepacker.com 
Fig. 1.1: US Avocado imports by country, 2010 to 2018
The supply of avocados is unpredictable. It is estimated that to produce one kilogram of avocado requires 2000 litres of water. Consequently, production is highly susceptible to drought conditions such as those that affected Central American growers in 2018. When this happens, the price of avocados increases as shown in Fig. 1.2.
Source: Mexican Ministry of Economy
Fig. 1.2: Wholesale price of Mexican avocados in the US,January to July 2019 (pesos per 10kg box)
A shortage in supply provides an opportunity for new producers to enter the global market. Kenya, for example, has expanded its productive capacity and signed an agreement to supply the Chinese market. Even some New Zealand farmers switched from dairy to avocado production. 
The global market for avocados is expected to continue to grow over the next few years. Rising prices will continue to increase production. It should be recognised, however, that there are increasing objections to higher production. In Mexico, for example, farmers have cleared forests to cultivate more avocados. This has put a strain on water supplies and raised concerns about the effects of the farmers’ actions on climate change. These concerns have led one market research report to conclude that ‘the price mechanism is not working to allocate resources successfully.’

118,"The changing market for avocados
The global consumption of avocados has increased in the last few years, particularly in the United States (US) but also in China and parts of Europe. This growth is largely due to the increasing popularity of ‘guacamole’ (smashed avocado) and the health benefits claimed for its regular consumption. The US is the largest importer of avocados with supplies coming mainly from Central and South American producers as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Fig. 1.1: US Avocado imports by country, 2010 to 2018
The supply of avocados is unpredictable. It is estimated that to produce one kilogram of avocado requires 2000 litres of water. Consequently, production is highly susceptible to drought conditions such as those that affected Central American growers in 2018. When this happens, the price of avocados increases as shown in Fig. 1.2.

A shortage in supply provides an opportunity for new producers to enter the global market. Kenya, for example, has expanded its productive capacity and signed an agreement to supply the Chinese market. Even some New Zealand farmers switched from dairy to avocado production. 
The global market for avocados is expected to continue to grow over the next few years. Rising prices will continue to increase production. It should be recognised, however, that there are increasing objections to higher production. In Mexico, for example, farmers have cleared forests to cultivate more avocados. This has put a strain on water supplies and raised concerns about the effects of the farmers’ actions on climate change. These concerns have led one market research report to conclude that ‘the price mechanism is not working to allocate resources successfully.’

The question implies that an explanation of changes in demand and supply over the period April to July 2019 is required. So, no marks should be awarded for the usual general demand and supply factors.Demand side: new research into health benefits of avocados, buying for a special event e.g., Superbowl, panic buying. These changes will lead to a shift to the right of the demand curve.
Supply side: bad weather in Mexico leads to less supply; increased demand elsewhere reduces supply available to USA leading to a shift to the left of the supply curve

The data refers to the supply of avocados as being ‘unpredictable’ and therefore difficult to control when price changes. This is a short run consideration. Longer term improved methods of farming and irrigation can make supply more responsive to price changes.

The data in table 1.1 shows that the government budget has moved from a deficit to a surplus and the most likely cause will be a cut in government spending and/ or an increase in taxes. Analysis should consider how this is likely to impact at least one component of AD and therefore reduce AD and control the rate of inflation.
However, this move may also affect AS and analysis should consider e.g., how reduced subsidies due to a fall in government spending, possible reduced investment due to a rise in taxes etc. may cause AS to shift to the left. Other government policies such as a cut in interest rates may also have a counter effect and may be accepted.

6

The fall in the price of oil is likely to reduce the value of Russia’s exports and have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments, but this is only the case if the PeD is inelastic. A possible opportunity is that costs of production will fall for domestic firms that use oil and this may impact the Russian economy by making its exports more price competitive,
The impact of the fall in the value of the rouble could be positive or negative depending upon the PED of Russia's imports and exports. There is a threat however that will result from the possible imported inflation and this may impact the Russian economy by lowering living standards.

The relatively high rate of inflation has been caused by price rises in both the food and the nonfood sectors. In terms of the food sector, there have been significant rises in the price of fish, chicken and vegetables, particularly onions. In terms of the non-food sector, price rises have been significant in healthcare, transport and energy resources such as gas.
The Bangladesh Government is concerned about the possible consequences of a relatively high rate of inflation. It has now therefore set an annual inflation rate target of 5.5%.
The central bank of Bangladesh has the maintenance of price stability as one of its main objectives. It uses monetary policy to control the rate of increase of prices in the country. However, there is always the possibility that tough monetary policies could do more harm than good to an economy, compared with the possible use of fiscal policy.
The central bank recognises that inflation can be caused by both demand-pull and cost-push factors in the economy. A particular cause of inflation is the increase in wages. The Wage Rate Index (WRI) rose in December 2019 by 6.6% compared with a 6.4% rise in the index in November.

The central bank of Bangladesh has the maintenance of price stability as one of its main objectives. It uses monetary policy to control the rate of increase of prices in the country. However, there is always the possibility that tough monetary policies could do more harm than good to an economy, compared with the possible use of fiscal policy.
The central bank recognises that inflation can be caused by both demand-pull and cost-push factors in the economy. A particular cause of inflation is the increase in wages. The Wage Rate Index (WRI) rose in December 2019 by 6.6% compared with a 6.4% rise in the index in November.

The domestic consequences for Bangladesh of a relatively high rate of inflation could include:

redistribution of income as the real earnings of some workers in Bangladesh rise and the real earnings of others in Bangladesh fall
borrowers in Bangladesh will gain and lenders in Bangladesh will lose
menu costs in Bangladesh, e.g., the cost of changing prices
shoe leather costs in Bangladesh, e.g., the search for good returns
greater uncertainty – could discourage investment in Bangladesh
purchasing power of money for people in Bangladesh weaker

The external consequences for Bangladesh of a relatively high rate of inflation could include:

if the rate of inflation in Bangladesh is higher than in other countries (it states it is one of the highest in Asia), this will make the country's exports less competitive (the effect will depend on PED)
this may worsen the current account position of Bangladesh.

Demand-pull inflation:

it is stated that there has been an annual increase in the Wage Rate Index (WRI) of 6.6% in the last month of 2019
increased consumer spending, e.g., through greater consumer confidence resulting from an increase in income
the AD curve will shift to the right causing an increase in the general price level

Cost-push inflation:

wage increases to employees that are not linked to higher productivity
the AS curve will shift to the left causing an increase in the general price level

The diagrams need to be accurately labelled, with the vertical axis labelled 'general price level' or 'price level' and the horizontal axis labelled 'real output' or 'real GDP'.

Potential advantages of monetary policy:

a rise in interest rates can be effective in reducing the level of aggregate demand, especially if demand is interest-elastic; can be effective reducing demand-pull inflation
other monetary policies to control inflation can include a reduction of the money supply and a rise in the exchange rate

Potential disadvantages of monetary policy:

an increase in interest rates may not be significant enough to have an effect, i.e., demand is relatively inelastic
the impact of an increase in interest rates can take a relatively long time to take effect
it will be less useful in controlling cost-push inflation
a rise in the exchange rate will not be useful if the PED for imports and exports is inelastic
a reduction of the money supply may sometimes be difficult to bring about

Potential advantages of fiscal policy:

a reduction in public expenditure can help to reduce the level of aggregate demand in an economy
an increase in the level of taxes can also have such an effect

Potential disadvantages of fiscal policy:

it may not always be easy for a government to change its expenditure/revenue plans
increased taxes can have a disincentive effect
less useful controlling cost-push inflation

134,"Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

138,"The effects of European Union (EU) labour migration
In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.
A critic of this free movement of labour stated that ""It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages.""
In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported ""There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services. Wages may have been affected for low-skilled workers but only marginally downward.""
Other economists have argued that, in theory, ""the impacts of immigration on wages and employment critically depends on whether migrants' skills are complements to, or substitutes for, the skills of existing workers. These impacts vary between the short run and long run. In the short run if the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages. If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in wages of existing workers. In the long run the economy can adjust to the increase in labour supply.""
Some governments have introduced a minimum wage to help those workers on low pay. The wage is set to increase to match any increase in inflation.

With the help of information in the article assess whether the increasing numbers of migrant workers are an advantage or a disadvantage to the receiving country.
Positive effects

skills of migrant workers can complement those domestic workers and increase productivity and therefore increase economic growth
earnings of migrant workers can create jobs – multiplier effect – increase in AD
without migrant workers the level of AS could not meet AD causing inflation
migrants fill jobs where there are labour shortages

In the sixteen months to April 2019 thirteen airlines ceased trading in Europe. This reflected a global trend where small airlines found it increasingly difficult to compete against large airlines, which have continued to grow.
Large airlines charge a price for a flight that includes meals and entertainment for passengers. Smaller airlines charge a price for the flight only and passengers need to pay extra for other services such as meals. 
Large airlines benefit from economies of scale. Without these cost-reductions some smaller airlines have gone bankrupt.
The reduction in the number of airlines has not reduced the overcapacity in the market because the aircrew and aircraft of the bankrupt airlines were acquired by the remaining companies, which have developed into super-airlines. This has left passengers with fewer airlines to choose from and more expensive fares. It was predicted that this would lead to an increase in the market share for the top five European airlines from 50% of the European market in 2019 to match the top five United States (US) airlines, which control 77% of the US market.
The development of super-airlines took place at the same time as increasing regulation of the airline market. For example, the European Union (EU) will only grant operating licences for flights between EU countries to an EU airline. This has prevented non-EU airlines from competing on EU routes.
For the super-airlines, large scale is the easy way to avoid the stresses and strains of open competition. For passengers this will lead to higher prices and poorer service.

146,"The economic impacts of the increasing use of all-electric cars
Some governments have agreed targets to reduce air pollution and, as part of this, are concerned about the social costs caused by the use of petrol and diesel vehicles. In response, car manufacturers are producing all-electric cars. The sales of these are increasing, especially in developed countries. The success of this switch to all-electric cars will depend on improving both battery technology as well as building an infrastructure in which, as drivers reduce their use of fossil fuels, electricity charging points will replace petrol pumps.
Fig. 1.1 shows the cumulative number of all-electric cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Fig. 1.2 shows the annual sales of all cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Some forecasters predict that about one third of the world’s cars will be all-electric by 2040. Their forecasts are based on the assumption that the costs of batteries to run these cars will have declined steeply from their present levels. Battery costs are dependent on supplies of various metals which are used as component parts. Supplies of these metals are finite and their prices, linked to mining costs, will be crucial in increasing the scale of all-electric car production.
In 2016, the cost of the batteries was 49% of the total cost of the car. In 2017 it was stated at a New Energy conference in Shanghai that battery prices would need to drop by more than half before all-electric cars would become competitive with cars powered by petrol and diesel engines. 
Oil producers claim that growth in sales of all-electric cars will not substantially reduce world demand for oil. The world needs oil for much more than just cars. Cars account for only about a fifth of the 95 million barrels the world consumes every day. Most of the rest is used in industry or to fuel heavy goods vehicles, aircraft and ships, which do not have easy non-oil alternatives. In developing economies, petrol sales are expected to continue rising because these countries do not have the infrastructure or sufficient capital investment to enable the switch to electric vehicles.

Use the information to discuss what might happen to the long-run average cost of producing batteries for all-electric cars.

Falling LRAC depends on economies of scale. LRAC comprises AFC and AVC [2].
Output of electric cars is expected to rise significantly in the long run. As output rises, AFC may well fall because of economies of scale in production [1]
However, unless battery technology changes, AVC are likely to rise eventually. Batteries are a large component of the cost, and their manufacture depends on finite supplies of component metals. As demand increases, prices will rise as mineral reserves become depleted. This could counteract possible reductions in AFC. [2]

Use the information to assess whether it is likely that the switch to allelectric cars will substantially reduce world demand for oil. Evidence that there will be a substantial reduction in demand for oil

Forecasters predict ⅓ cars will be electric by 2040 it must reduce demand for oil as a fuel. [1]

Evidence against a large reduction in demand for oil:

In 2016 only 20 % of world demand for oil was for use as a fuel for cars. Demand for the other 80 % of uses do not have easy non-oil alternatives. Demand is, thus, relatively price inelastic. [2]
Demand for oil in emerging economies is also expected to continue to rise. They also do not have the resources to change the infrastructure to install charging points. Their demand for oil is also relatively price inelastic. [2]

On balance the evidence suggest that oil demand will not be reduced substantially. [1]

Assess the effects on the social costs of transport of replacing diesel and petrol engine cars with all-electric cars.

Some understanding required of private costs plus external costs = social costs: reward a definition and/or diagram [2]
Petrol and diesel engines emissions linked to negative externalities due to causing pollution of the atmosphere and health problems especially for those living in urban areas:MSC > MPC [1]
Electric car use will lower external costs through eliminating carbon pollution [1] but there may still be as many cars so problems of traffic congestion, especially in urban areas, will continue to get worse as demand for cars increases. [1]
Other transport – ships, planes, heavy goods vehicles – will still depend on oil and will probably increase as demand increases. External costs are likely to rise. [1]
Therefore, external costs will not be eliminated entirely. Some negative external costs will be associated also with increased mining of metal ores.[1]
However, the beneficial consumption externality of electric cars makes MSB > MPB so they will be promoted as a kind of merit good. Overall balance is uncertain. [1]

In 2018, real output in China's economy grew by 6.6%, its lowest figure this century (see Fig. 1.1). Many economists believe that growth in China's real output will continue to be around this level over the next few years.
In looking to the future, the Chinese government has sought to restructure its economy. This has resulted in an increased contribution from domestic consumption, with less reliance on large-scale manufacturing in favour of quality manufacturing.

For Chinese consumers, buying a house is the main priority, followed by purchasing a new car. Table 1.1 shows the annual rate of change in new car sales from 2010 to 2017.
China's plans for maintaining its growth in real output at a rate of around 6.6% are threatened by ongoing tensions over trade with the United States (US). These tensions provide a real threat to China meeting even its most pessimistic growth targets for real output. Various studies have estimated the effects of a protectionist trade war with the US on China's economy. These estimates are all negative and range from –0.6% to –1.4% of real output.

In 2018, real output in China's economy grew by 6.6%, its lowest figure this century (see Fig. 1.1). Many economists believe that growth in China's real output will continue to be around this level over the next few years.
In looking to the future, the Chinese government has sought to restructure its economy. This has resulted in an increased contribution from domestic consumption, with less reliance on large-scale manufacturing in favour of quality manufacturing. For Chinese consumers, buying a house is the main priority, followed by purchasing a new car. Table 1.1 shows the annual rate of change in new car sales from 2010 to 2017.

Increasing domestic consumption will increase AD and output. This can be done through reducing direct or indirect taxes. The increased spending benefits the Chinese economy through increased employment and can be more certain than having to rely on external factors such as the global economy or US trade policy to generate growth. Care must be taken to not increase the rate of inflation as AD increases Alternative policies could be increasing investment or export-led growth

India's income has grown at its slowest rate in almost five years, according to the latest data released by the government. In the past financial year - April 2018 to March 2019 - income grew by 6.8%. And in the quarter between January and March 2019, it expanded by just 5.8% - falling behind the rate of China's growth for the first time in nearly two years. This means India is no longer the world's fastest-growing economy. The new data make it clear that India is facing an economic slowdown.
Unlike China, India's growth in income has been driven by domestic consumption over the past 15 years. But data released over the past few months suggest that consumer spending is slowing, despite the continuing growth in incomes. Motorbike and scooter sales are down. Demand for bank loans has slowed and India's leading maker of fast-moving consumer goods, such as packaged food and drink, has reported slower revenue growth in the past quarter. However, sales of smartphones have continued to increase faster than incomes have been growing. All of these are important indicators for measuring the state of consumption spending. 
The government has promised that it would cut income tax to ensure greater purchasing power and some economists believe that the government should also consider cutting business taxes in the next budget, which will be announced in July 2019. These measures should act as a stimulus for the economy.
India's government has promised to spend US$1.44 trillion to build roads and other infrastructure such as bridges and street lighting, but India's large budget deficit might restrict the government's options. Many observers say that this money will have to come from the private sector. Experts say that the widening fiscal deficit will hold back medium-term and long-term growth.
Weak exports have also been a problem when it comes to creating jobs. In response the government is expected to prioritise policies that will make Indian businesses more competitive.

For an identification of a valid supply-side measure that could make Indian businesses more competitive (1 mark) For an explanation of how this will make businesses more competitive (up to 2 marks) The 3rd mark must refer specifically to 'more competitive'.

Supply-side measures mentioned in the extract include cutting income taxes, cutting business taxes and improving infrastructure. However, any valid supply-side measure that might make Indian businesses more competitive is acceptableAny policy chosen as a supply-side measure should be explained as a supplyside tool rather than demand-side to gain any credit at all, even for identification. For example, cutting income taxes should not be credited if it is discussed in terms of a boost to consumption/demand, but only if discussed, for example, as increasing/ improving the labour force

Cutting interest rates will have a number of effects. There should be an increase in consumption and investment expenditure, and this will increase aggregate demand. In addition, the impact will be an outflow of foreign currency and a fall in the exchange rate. This should stimulate net exports and again aggregate demand will increase. The increase in aggregate demand will stimulate output and employment However, a disadvantage is that demandpull inflation will occur, and this has internal and external consequences for India's economy In evaluation, candidates may refer to the possible impact on LRAS due to possible additional investment. This may, of course, obviously offset any inflationary pressure

The consequences of hyperinflation are far-reaching. Inflation undermines the functions of money. Rapid price rises encourage panic-buying by consumers, creating shortages that further increase inflation. In the most extreme cases countries stop using money completely, and resort to barter. In Zimbabwe, hyperinflation led to the abandonment of its currency in 2008 and the use of the US dollar as an alternative. More recently, Venezuelan restaurants and supermarkets stopped displaying prices and consumers only found out the value of their purchases at the checkout.
To avoid the consequences of high inflation, central banks often set a low 'target' rate of inflation, typically around 2% a year. But this policy has also been criticised by some people. If central banks follow such a target the outcome would be to erode the real value of money over time. Central banks have often been instructed by governments to have an inflation target, and yet even a 2% inflation rate will halve the real value of money in 36 years.
Central banks can use high interest rates as a tool of monetary policy to keep down the rate of inflation, but very often monetary policy requires low interest rates to stimulate consumption spending and investment in an economy.
It should not be forgotten that there are potential benefits of relatively low levels of inflation and this is why some countries have an inflation target of, say, 2%. A former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund even suggested that many countries' inflation target should be 4% rather than 2%.

Central banks have often been instructed by governments to have an inflation target, and yet even a 2% inflation rate will halve the real value of money in 36 years.
Central banks can use high interest rates as a tool of monetary policy to keep down the rate of inflation, but very often monetary policy requires low interest rates to stimulate consumption spending and investment in an economy.

Hyperinflation can prevent money serving as a medium of exchange when people lose confidence in money Hyperinflation, as in Zimbabwe, can prevent money serving as a unit of account/a measure of value in an economy Hyperinflation is likely to prevent money serving effectively as a store of value/a store of wealth because its real value, i.e. its purchasing power, will be reduced Hyperinflation is likely to prevent money serving effectively as a standard for deferred payment because people will be reluctant to exchange anything on a credit basis if the value of money is rapidly falling

167,"Competition in passenger aircraft manufacturing  
Two companies produce all of the world's passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of over 150 passengers. The supply of these is about 1600 aircraft a year and is divided almost equally between the two competing companies, who both benefit from extremely strong brand identity and customer loyalty.
The aircraft are made in two versions: single-aisle aircraft that carry 200 passengers and doubleaisle aircraft that carry 300 to 350 passengers.
In 2018 both companies took over other firms which produced a range of aircraft seating between 40 and 150 passengers. The owners of the other firms had difficulties in financing and developing their new aircraft.
Recent competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry has aimed at improving fuel efficiency, developing longer non-stop flying ranges and developing very large aircraft with a capacity of 500 passengers. The companies have been successful in achieving the first two aims. 
The third aim of developing very large aircraft was intended to move larger numbers of passengers between 'hub' airports, where they would transfer to smaller aircraft for onwards transport to regional airports. Whilst it has achieved increased passenger capacity, this development has not been a success for the airlines that bought these very large aircraft. The need for these was undermined by the success of the first two competitive developments. 
The nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry is that it involves significant fixed costs. The research and development (R&D) costs of a new aircraft can rise to US$26 billion.
Currently the two companies are concerned that China, in its drive to increase the value of its exports, will enter the aircraft manufacturing industry in the next 10 to 15 years and add a new level of competition.

172,"Public services – better or worse? 
A government usually has macroeconomic policy aims that it hopes will enable some success in raising the quality of life, or well-being, of the population. In doing this the government also hopes to achieve efficiency in the use of resources.
Efficiency is measured by relating inputs to outputs. Inputs are relatively easy to count: they are financial costs of public services. Output can also be counted, but it is not necessarily a good measure of the outcome. The outcome is much harder to calculate. It is broader and more subjective – how do we assess whether a public service is 'better' or 'worse'?
This is where a knowledge of well-being makes an enormous difference. It could provide a much clearer view of the trade-offs that have to be made in allocating taxpayers' money to public services. Take the example of healthcare. To maximise the impact of expenditure on well-being, the budget may need to be adjusted to give more to mental health services and less to building general hospitals. For older people it could mean giving priority to programmes that would keep them out of hospital. 
A focus on well-being should lead to better outcomes. This is where policymakers need a better understanding of behavioural economics. Governments have established Behavioural Insights teams, or Nudge Units. They have had some success. A small change in the wording of a letter to people who owed tax demonstrated how more behaviourally sensitive language sped up payments. The unit also found that jobseekers were nearly twice as likely to turn up for a job fair if the text message from the job centre used their names, and nearly three times as likely if the person sending the text message added 'good luck'.
Do tax reliefs persuade people to save? No. So enrol them instead automatically in a pensions programme as a default position, with the possibility of opting out. Allowing people to learn from mistakes is good: it reduces dependency on the public sector and helps people make better decisions for themselves. But some errors, such as failing to save anything until you are too old to earn, cannot be reversed. Then an early 'nudge' is justified. It has proved successful in spreading the habit of saving for retirement into groups not persuaded by tax reliefs alone. 
In the long term this, and similar behavioural changes, may well have more influence on well-being than can be represented by concentrating on a monetary calculation of GDP. Other economic indicators could be used to assess this change in well-being.

176,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

177,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

182,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

187,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

193,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

199,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

204,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

207,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

210,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

216,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

221,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

227,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

228,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

233,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

238,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

244,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

250,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

255,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

258,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

261,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

267,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

272,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

278,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

279,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

284,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

289,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

295,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

301,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

306,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

309,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

312,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

318,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

323,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

329,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

330,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

335,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

340,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

346,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

352,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

357,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

360,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

363,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

369,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

374,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

380,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

381,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

386,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

391,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

397,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

403,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

408,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

411,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

414,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

420,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

425,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

431,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

432,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

437,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

442,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

448,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

454,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

459,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

462,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

465,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

471,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

Discuss two factors that will determine the extent of the impact the EU tariffs will have on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia. For each relevant factor identified (1 mark) explained (1 mark) and developed to show the impact on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia (1 mark) e.g. The ped of rice (from Myanmar and Cambodia in the EU) (1 mark). If the demand is price inelastic this means that the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in QD (1 mark). Therefore, the exports of Myanmar and Cambodia may not significantly reduce (1 mark) Two factors required (2 × 3 marks)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

476,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

482,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

",Use the information in Fig. 1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. [2],"a.i
Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

483,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

488,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

493,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

499,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

505,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

510,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

513,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

516,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

522,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

527,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

533,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

534,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

539,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

544,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

550,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

556,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

561,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

564,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

567,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

573,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

578,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

584,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

585,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

590,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

595,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

601,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

607,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

612,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

615,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

618,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

624,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

Discuss two factors that will determine the extent of the impact the EU tariffs will have on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia. For each relevant factor identified (1 mark) explained (1 mark) and developed to show the impact on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia (1 mark) e.g. The ped of rice (from Myanmar and Cambodia in the EU) (1 mark). If the demand is price inelastic this means that the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in QD (1 mark). Therefore, the exports of Myanmar and Cambodia may not significantly reduce (1 mark) Two factors required (2 × 3 marks)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

629,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

635,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

636,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

641,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

646,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

652,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

658,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

663,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

666,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

669,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

675,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

Discuss two factors that will determine the extent of the impact the EU tariffs will have on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia. For each relevant factor identified (1 mark) explained (1 mark) and developed to show the impact on the economies of Myanmar and Cambodia (1 mark) e.g. The ped of rice (from Myanmar and Cambodia in the EU) (1 mark). If the demand is price inelastic this means that the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in QD (1 mark). Therefore, the exports of Myanmar and Cambodia may not significantly reduce (1 mark) Two factors required (2 × 3 marks)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

680,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

686,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

687,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

692,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

697,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

703,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

709,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

714,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

717,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

720,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

726,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

731,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

737,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

738,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

743,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

748,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

754,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

760,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

765,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

768,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

771,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

777,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

A number of policies are acceptable. These include government subsidisation mentioned in the text: • export subsidies • devaluation of the currency to reduce export prices etc. Do not reward references to depreciation unless it is made clear that this is a ‘managed’ depreciation.Policies can also be designed to improve quality, productivity, etc. The policies must relate to government action and not action by individual firms (note – the gov action could be from either Myanmar/Cambodia OR from the EU.)

If the demand is price inelastic this means that the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in QD (1 mark). Therefore, the exports of Myanmar and Cambodia may not significantly reduce (1 mark) Two factors required (2 × 3 marks)

General factors are required that apply to both countries. These include the price elasticity of demand for rice from these countries in the EU, the cross elasticity of demand between rice from Myanmar and Cambodia and rice from the EU, the extent to which they can find other markets, how the governments of these countries respond e.g. by providing subsidies/devaluing their currencies etc. The impact on the economy may be on balance of payments, employment, growth etc and needs to be clear. Reference to the fact that the tariffs will be substantial as quoted in the text, should be credited

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

782,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

788,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

Use the information in Fig.1.1 to describe the changes in the number of journeys by bus in Great Britain from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Various possibilities including: • Bus passenger journeys outside London have fallen over the period/from c 3.2 bn to c 2.7bn • Bus passenger journeys in London increased up to 2013/14 but have then fallen slightly/overall have increased/from c 1.3 bn to c2.3 bn • Overall bus passenger journeys have increased (1 mark for any of these)

The data clearly shows that overall during the period bus passenger journeys outside of London have fallen BUT within London, over the same period bus passenger journeys have increased. Within London, passenger journeys increased up to 2013/14 but declined thereafter.

789,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers.

(up to 3 marks) For analysis which explains why a minimum price may not be effective. (up to 3 marks) MAXIMUM of 5 marks for analysis 1 mark for a justified conclusion as to whether a minimum price would be effective in reducing congestion
6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

794,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

799,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

805,"Luxembourg's answer to resource misallocation in the transport market
Congestion is unfortunately a very familiar feature of most road transport networks. It occurs when there is too much traffic relative to road capacity or more simply, when demand exceeds supply. Congestion means longer journey times and wasted fuel, which adversely affects car drivers and bus passengers. Roads are scarce resources, but usually there is no price for using them. This represents a misallocation of resources.
Fig. 1.1 shows the changes in passenger journeys by public transport in Great Britain (GB) since 1997/98. The government has tried various policies to encourage more use of bus transport in the capital city, London, as well as in the rest of GB. These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

6
A minimum price for fuel above the equilibrium price would increase the price for car users and in theory, lead to reduced demand and reduced congestion. However, this would only be effective if the demand for fuel was price elastic. In addition, it will lead to excess supply and the possible formation of informal markets. It also depends on the ability of the government to maintain and enforce the minimum price.

These policies include privatisation along with increased bus subsidies and higher taxes on car users. All have failed to improve the allocation of resources and the cost of all travel continues to rise at a faster rate than the cost of living (See Fig. 1.2). The price of using cars has risen by less than other forms of transport since 2010 and some experts have suggested that a minimum price for fuel should be introduced.

It is therefore interesting to see what Luxembourg, a relatively small European country, plans to do about its transport problems. From March 2020, the Luxembourg government has decided that all prices for public transport use (including buses and trains) will be removed, making travel by public transport free to consumers. The cost to its government is forecast to be almost US$1 billion per year.
Luxembourg's radical policy is one that should be given serious consideration in Great Britain and in other countries that face similar resource misallocation in their transport markets.

811,"Rice farmers in Cambodia and Myanmar under pressure
Rice farmers across Cambodia and Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, have been left searching for new markets for their crop after the European Union (EU) announced that it will now be imposing substantial tariffs on rice from both countries for the next three years. An investigation has confirmed that the increase in rice imports from these countries has been damaging to EU rice producers.
Representatives of EU farmers welcomed the decision, as the cheap rice imported from Southeast Asia has been contributing to EU farmers and labourers leaving agriculture and migrating to towns. 
EU rice imports from the two Southeast Asian countries increased from 9000 tonnes in 2012 to 360000 tonnes in 2017, leading to a sharp fall in the price of rice in the EU. In 2018, approximately 30% of all EU rice imports came from countries with duty-free status, with most being shipped in from Cambodia and Myanmar. The increase in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers. Their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.
Rice is currently grown across eight EU countries including Italy, whose government initially requested that the EU investigate the issue in March 2018 to protect the EU rice industry.
Cambodia and Myanmar have enjoyed duty-free rice exports to the EU since 2010, when tariffs on the crop were removed as part of a policy which aims to promote EU trade in goods with the world’s 50 least-developed countries. Other more developed countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, have long been paying tariffs of around US$200 per tonne for rice exports to the EU. For both Cambodia and Myanmar, rice is a major export and the EU has become their most profitable market, so the new tariff has harmed their economies.
The EU is currently Cambodia's largest destination for rice exports, accounting for 43% of all exported rice. It is thought that Cambodia's rice industry could be put in a critical condition as a result of the EU tariffs. In order to offset the additional costs resulting from the tariffs, local rice farmers will have to cut production costs, and may need to grow different crops altogether. One suggestion is that government subsidies could make Cambodia's rice industry more competitive. 
The impact of the tariff will ultimately depend on the extent to which EU consumers consider rice produced in the EU to be a good substitute for Cambodian rice. Consumers in Europe may not mind paying a bit more for Cambodian rice.
Myanmar is in a similar situation, as the EU has become one of Myanmar's major rice markets. Myanmar reached an all-time high of 293000 tonnes of rice exported to the EU in 2017. But this could change now that there is a high barrier for entry to the EU rice market, forcing farmers to look closer to home for different buyers. Myanmar's Rice Federation stated that the EU's decision to levy tariffs on the country's rice exports had serious potential negative effects on Myanmar's economy.

This is effectively a question on free trade or protection. Good answers will need to recognise the context of the case study. For example, if they suggest that the European rice farmers are an example of an inefficient ‘sunset industry’ they need to question whether these should be protected. If the market discussed is clearly a market other than rice then do not reward.

816,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

819,"Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables to exceed US$4 billion
The value of Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports reached US$1.3 billion in the first four months of 2018, a year-on-year increase of 30%, according to the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture. With a high export growth rate in the past four years, the sector is expected to exceed the export target of US$4 billion set for 2018.
A government spokesperson stated that because world trade in fruit and vegetables is worth US$230 billion a year, with an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%, there is more scope for Vietnam to increase its fruit and vegetable exports. The spokesperson said that Vietnam must use more land to grow crops to export and build additional modern food processing facilities to take advantage of these opportunities.The increase in the export of fruit and vegetables will add to Vietnam's current account balance. Fig. 1.1 below shows the balance of the current account of the balance of payments for Vietnam from Q1 2016 to Q2 2018.

Despite its impressive results in exporting fruit and vegetables, Vietnam faces possible risks because it relies very heavily on China, its biggest fruit and vegetable importer. China accounted for 77% of Vietnam's exports of fruit and vegetables in the first four months of 2018 while the United States, its second biggest importer, accounted for just 2.8% and Japan, its third biggest importer, accounted for 2.7%. Some analysts believe that Vietnam's agricultural sector in general, and fruit and vegetable producers in particular, should explore other potential countries for their exports.
According to the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, fruit and vegetable exporters face additional costs in complying with administrative burdens on trade, such as strict hygiene and food safety regulations. Vietnam's producers need to ensure that product quality is as high as possible and production costs as low as possible if they are to succeed.

In the Euro Area a strong economy such as Germany has benefited much more from the use of the euro single currency than weaker economies such as Spain and Greece. As these weaker economies do not have their own currencies, they have been forced to adjust their domestic economic policies to tackle balance of payments problems by decreasing wages and reducing government spending instead of devaluation. 
The unemployment rate in the weaker economies of the Euro Area remains higher than in the stronger economies. For example, in Spain it was 18.4% in 2016 with 40% of young people out of work. By contrast the unemployment rate in Germany was 3.9%, an all-time low in 2016. Although unemployment across countries in the entire Euro Area decreased from 2013 to 2016, prices have shown a strong upward trend in 2016 which may result in reduced consumer spending. In future this may cause increases in interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.

826,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

830,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

Persistent surpluses on the balance of trade in goods and services could increase aggregate demand in Malaysia leading to high employment and a rise in real GDP. This is a positive outcome, but it could generate demand-pull inflation if the economy is operating at full capacity. In addition, if the surpluses are maintained through government intervention there might be tension with trading partners and competitors. This might lead to retaliation.

832,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

So 5 marks maximum if no conclusion provided.

The rise in the price of vanilla could be expected to have a positive effect on Madagascar’s economy. There is expected to be an increase in the value of exports that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate output and employment. Much depends however upon the price elasticity of demand for vanilla. If the demand is price elastic then export revenues will fall and aggregate demand will contract. The current account of the balance of payments might become a deficit. The shortage of natural vanilla and the rise in its price might result in a movement to the use of cheaper vanillin and Madagascar’s exports might fall with a negative impact upon output and employment. In addition a negative impact might arise if export revenues increase, but because of lack of capacity in the economy demand pull inflation is created. Some might argue that Madagascar has a clear comparative advantage in production of vanilla so the impact might be positive as resources are re-allocated back into vanilla production, but some might use the text to question whether it is a good idea to be over reliant upon one crop. Candidates need to give a balanced answer that considers both the positive and negative impact before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Price elasticity of demand could be relevant, but is not essential for full marks.

838,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

841,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

844,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

850,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

853,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

",Explain why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be relatively more elastic than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with natural vanilla. [4],"c
For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

",Discuss whether the recent rise in the price of vanilla is on balance likely to have a positive or negative impact upon Madagascar's economy. [6],"d
For analysis of the likely positive impact in terms of the current account of the balance of payments and the possible impact on output, prices and employment. (Up to 3 marks) For analysis of the likely negative impact in terms of the current account of the balance of payments and the possible impact on output, prices and employment. (Up to 3 marks) Reserve 1 mark for a reasoned conclusion on whether the rise in price is likely to have a positive or negative impact upon Madagascar's economy. So 5 marks maximum if no conclusion provided.

The rise in the price of vanilla could be expected to have a positive effect on Madagascar’s economy. There is expected to be an increase in the value of exports that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate output and employment. Much depends however upon the price elasticity of demand for vanilla. If the demand is price elastic then export revenues will fall and aggregate demand will contract. The current account of the balance of payments might become a deficit. The shortage of natural vanilla and the rise in its price might result in a movement to the use of cheaper vanillin and Madagascar’s exports might fall with a negative impact upon output and employment. In addition a negative impact might arise if export revenues increase, but because of lack of capacity in the economy demand pull inflation is created. Some might argue that Madagascar has a clear comparative advantage in production of vanilla so the impact might be positive as resources are re-allocated back into vanilla production, but some might use the text to question whether it is a good idea to be over reliant upon one crop. Candidates need to give a balanced answer that considers both the positive and negative impact before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Price elasticity of demand could be relevant, but is not essential for full marks.

856,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

862,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

868,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

So 5 marks maximum if no conclusion provided.

The rise in the price of vanilla could be expected to have a positive effect on Madagascar’s economy. There is expected to be an increase in the value of exports that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate output and employment. Much depends however upon the price elasticity of demand for vanilla. If the demand is price elastic then export revenues will fall and aggregate demand will contract. The current account of the balance of payments might become a deficit. The shortage of natural vanilla and the rise in its price might result in a movement to the use of cheaper vanillin and Madagascar’s exports might fall with a negative impact upon output and employment. In addition a negative impact might arise if export revenues increase, but because of lack of capacity in the economy demand pull inflation is created. Some might argue that Madagascar has a clear comparative advantage in production of vanilla so the impact might be positive as resources are re-allocated back into vanilla production, but some might use the text to question whether it is a good idea to be over reliant upon one crop. Candidates need to give a balanced answer that considers both the positive and negative impact before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Price elasticity of demand could be relevant, but is not essential for full marks.

874,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

Customs union:

an agreement between two or more countries to remove trade barriers and reduce or eliminate customs duties on mutual trade
a customs union has a common external tariff against non-member countries

880,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

886,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

With reference to the extract and Fig. 1.1, use supply and demand diagrams to explain the change in the price of natural vanilla

In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

The rise in the price of vanilla from 2015 to 2018 was caused by • a decrease in the demand for vanillin as a result of concern about the health risks which caused an increase in the demand for vanilla. • a decrease in supply of vanilla caused by ‘poor harvests’ and the cyclone A decrease in supply as vanilla farmers withdrew from the industry is not an acceptable explanation because of the time period.

888,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process.

",Explain why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be relatively more elastic than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with natural vanilla. [4],"c
For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

(Up to 3 marks) Reserve 1 mark for a reasoned conclusion on whether the rise in price is likely to have a positive or negative impact upon Madagascar's economy. So 5 marks maximum if no conclusion provided.

The rise in the price of vanilla could be expected to have a positive effect on Madagascar’s economy. There is expected to be an increase in the value of exports that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate output and employment. Much depends however upon the price elasticity of demand for vanilla. If the demand is price elastic then export revenues will fall and aggregate demand will contract. The current account of the balance of payments might become a deficit. The shortage of natural vanilla and the rise in its price might result in a movement to the use of cheaper vanillin and Madagascar’s exports might fall with a negative impact upon output and employment. In addition a negative impact might arise if export revenues increase, but because of lack of capacity in the economy demand pull inflation is created. Some might argue that Madagascar has a clear comparative advantage in production of vanilla so the impact might be positive as resources are re-allocated back into vanilla production, but some might use the text to question whether it is a good idea to be over reliant upon one crop. Candidates need to give a balanced answer that considers both the positive and negative impact before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Price elasticity of demand could be relevant, but is not essential for full marks.

892,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

898,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

Persistent surpluses on the balance of trade in goods and services could increase aggregate demand in Malaysia leading to high employment and a rise in real GDP.

904,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

",Explain why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be relatively more elastic than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with natural vanilla. [4],"c
For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

Much depends however upon the price elasticity of demand for vanilla. If the demand is price elastic then export revenues will fall and aggregate demand will contract. The current account of the balance of payments might become a deficit. The shortage of natural vanilla and the rise in its price might result in a movement to the use of cheaper vanillin and Madagascar’s exports might fall with a negative impact upon output and employment. In addition a negative impact might arise if export revenues increase, but because of lack of capacity in the economy demand pull inflation is created. Some might argue that Madagascar has a clear comparative advantage in production of vanilla so the impact might be positive as resources are re-allocated back into vanilla production, but some might use the text to question whether it is a good idea to be over reliant upon one crop. Candidates need to give a balanced answer that considers both the positive and negative impact before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Price elasticity of demand could be relevant, but is not essential for full marks.

910,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

916,"Malaysia's persistent trade surplus
Malaysia has the third highest income per head in South East Asia and, in the last six years, has experienced an average rate of growth approaching 6% per year. It is now a successful 'newly industrialised market economy' with a strong export sector. This strength is seen in its consistent surplus on its balance of trade in goods and services (see Fig. 1.1).
In the past, Malaysia's economy was firmly based on the production of basic raw materials such as rubber and tin. In more recent years, however, its growing prosperity has come about through it being a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, petroleum and natural gas. China is its biggest export market, accounting for 16% of total exports in 2016, and a further 11% of exports go to the European Union (EU). Malaysia's economy though remains vulnerable to external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which led to capital outflows.
Despite what appears to be a strong external trade position, the foreign exchange rate of Malaysia's currency, the ringgit (RM), against the US dollar has experienced significant change since 2013 (see Fig. 1.2). Given the importance of trade in goods and services to its economy, any volatility and uncertainty of the ringgit's value may well hinder Malaysia in its drive to become a 'high income economy'.

In general, a depreciation of a foreign exchange rate should lead to a positive change in the balance of trade e.g. a deficit becomes a surplus. An appreciation should lead to a negative change in the balance of trade e.g. a surplus becomes a deficit. How the change in the foreign exchange rate actually affects the balance of trade is determined by the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, but this is not required.

922,"Ice cream producers struggle with record vanilla prices
Fig. 1.1 Vanilla Prices, January 2004 to May 2018 (US dollars per kilogram)
The price of natural vanilla hit a record high of US$600 per kilogram in May 2018, making it even more expensive than silver. As a result, many ice cream producers are considering whether they should raise their prices or perhaps stop selling the vanilla flavour of ice cream. The price of natural vanilla has been rising sharply since March 2017 when a cyclone hit Madagascar, which accounts for 75% of global production. Natural vanilla represents 20% of Madagascan exports, worth around US$600 million at current prices.
Natural vanilla comes from the vanilla orchid, which produces vanilla beans. Madagascar has the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, but poor harvests have reduced the country’s vanilla production by more than 20%, leading to a worldwide supply shortage. It takes three years for the plant to start producing. So if there is a sharp rise in price, people plant more, but then it takes three years for the new supplies to reach the market.
Vanillin is a synthetic substitute to natural vanilla that can be used in the production of ice cream. It is made from more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials, such as wood pulp and petroleum and it has been falling in price. For many years, some of the world’s largest producers of ice cream replaced natural vanilla with vanillin. A consequence of this falling demand for natural vanilla was that Madagascar’s farmers earned very low returns and many ceased growing natural vanilla. Surprisingly, despite there being fewer growers, the price of natural vanilla stayed low between 2005 and 2012.
However, from 2012, concerns about possible health risks arising from the use of vanillin caused some producers to use more natural vanilla in their ice cream production process. For example, in 2015, one of the world’s largest ice cream producers announced plans to end their use of vanillin and use only natural ingredients by 2020. In recent years, however, the sharply rising price of natural vanilla has persuaded some ice cream makers to consider turning back to vanillin. As a result, some of the leading producers of ice cream have more than a year’s stock of vanillin.

",Explain why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be relatively more elastic than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with natural vanilla. [4],"c
For a clear understanding of the concept of price elasticity of supply (this could be shown through an accurate formula for PES) (1 mark) And the distinction between elastic and less elastic in terms of the extent to which the quantity of ice cream supplied can respond to a change in price (1 mark) For an explanation of why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanillin is likely to be higher than the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla (or why the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is likely to be lower than the price elasticity of supply ice cream made with vanillin.   (Up to 2 marks)

The most important factors that influence the price elasticity of supply are the ease with which production can be increased or decreased and the availability of stocks. The former is determined for e.g. by the nature of the product, the availability of required factors of production any stocks held and the existence of spare capacity. It is likely that the price elasticity of supply of ice cream made with vanilla is less elastic than that made with vanillin because the text makes it clear that it takes a long time to produce new vanilla plants (3 years) and many farmers left the industry in the years that vanilla prices were falling meaning that there is unlikely to be any spare capacity. So even though vanilla prices are rising rapidly the quantity of natural vanilla supplied may be slow to rise. Vanillin on the other hand is made from ‘more reliable sources of plentiful raw materials’ that indicates that an increase in the quantity supplied can be made much more easily and the price elasticity of supply is likely to be more elastic.

(Up to 3 marks) Reserve 1 mark for a reasoned conclusion on whether the rise in price is likely to have a positive or negative impact upon Madagascar's economy. So 5 marks maximum if no conclusion provided.

The rise in the price of vanilla could be expected to have a positive effect on Madagascar’s economy. There is expected to be an increase in the value of exports that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate output and employment. Much depends however upon the price elasticity of demand for vanilla. If the demand is price elastic then export revenues will fall and aggregate demand will contract. The current account of the balance of payments might become a deficit. The shortage of natural vanilla and the rise in its price might result in a movement to the use of cheaper vanillin and Madagascar’s exports might fall with a negative impact upon output and employment. In addition a negative impact might arise if export revenues increase, but because of lack of capacity in the economy demand pull inflation is created. Some might argue that Madagascar has a clear comparative advantage in production of vanilla so the impact might be positive as resources are re-allocated back into vanilla production, but some might use the text to question whether it is a good idea to be over reliant upon one crop. Candidates need to give a balanced answer that considers both the positive and negative impact before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Price elasticity of demand could be relevant, but is not essential for full marks.

Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

933,"Latvia becomes a banking capital between the European Union's (EU's) east and west
Latvia regards itself as a financial bridge between Europe’s east and west. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Latvia (population 2.2 million) joined the EU (population 510 million) in 2004. It has since built itself into a banking centre for people from all parts of Europe and many other parts of the world, although its reputation as a financial centre has been growing since 1988 when two entrepreneurs founded a private bank, Parex Bank, in the capital, Riga.
In the early years of the 21st century, favourable credit conditions in Latvia contributed to an economic boom, but in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 Parex Bank, by then Latvia’s second biggest bank, needed government assistance and was nationalised.
The financial crisis caused Latvia's annual inflation rate to rise rapidly to 17.7% in May 2008, which was significantly higher than its average annual inflation rate of 3.7% for the period 1998–2018.
In 2008, the Latvian government decided to substantially reduce the size of the budget deficit, in an attempt to reduce the relatively high rate of inflation, through a series of fiscal measures such as increasing taxation and reducing public spending. 
Latvia emerged from the global financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy. The intention was that Latvia would eventually join the EU's common currency (the euro). Fig. 1.1 below shows the exchange rate of Latvian Lats (the country's former currency) per euro from 2007 to 2013.

In January 2014, Latvia did join the euro and this was welcomed by business leaders and economists in Latvia, stating that it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors. The governor of Latvia's central bank said: ""The euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment.""
However, not everybody in Latvia supported the introduction of the euro. Many people thought that Latvia would lose a certain amount of economic independence and that it would lead to an increase in prices and taxes.

934,"In pursuit of well-being
It has been said that the mark of success of a government is raising the quality of life or the well-being of the people in the country. This is sometimes measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). Table 1.1 shows the rank order of selected countries by the HDI and compares it with the rank by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of that country.
In order to understand how people make decisions, governments in the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia established Behavioural Insights Teams. They came to be known as the Nudge Units as they used nudge theories from behavioural economics.
It was hoped that this approach would help to achieve an increase in well-being as well as in economic growth and GDP. Nudge policies were used, with some success, to get people back to work, encourage them to pay their taxes on time and give them good reasons to save for future pensions or to study for improved qualifications. 
They were not, however, sufficient to eliminate government budget deficits which remained at a high level. There was an ever-rising demand for public services but this was not matched by an equal rise in tax revenues so the deficit increased.
Eliminating the government budget deficit continued to be a problem. One method of dealing with the problem was to increase taxation. However, tax rates were already high and even higher tax rates would not result in the increase in revenue that was needed. An alternative option was to increase government borrowing. There might be a strong case to support economic growth, but increasing the deficit in order to achieve this could risk causing another financial crisis.
A third option was to reduce government expenditure on public services. This could be achieved without causing a reduction in the quality of the service and a reduction in well-being if increases in productivity took place. Without continued increases in productivity, however, further cuts in spending could have serious long-term detrimental effects, especially in health provision and education.

",The information is entitled 'In pursuit of well-being'. Discuss whether the information supports the idea that GDP is a good measure of well-being. [6],"d
HDI is said to be a measure of well-being. Countries are ranked by HDI. Some countries with low HDI also have low GDP, but some with higher HDI do not have highest GDP. Examples should be given. But the GDP is not by per capita and does not use PPP. There is no real evidence that GDP is a comparable accurate measure of well-being.

938,"The growing problem of plastic waste
It has been estimated that, globally, consumers buy a staggering one million plastic bottles every minute and that 91% of these are not recycled. There is now real and growing concern about the serious threat to marine life caused by the dumping of plastic waste in the sea.
There are an estimated 150 million tonnes of plastic waste in the world’s oceans. Every year, millions of birds, mammals and fish die from eating or getting tangled in plastic waste. There is also growing evidence that humans could become ill when consuming fish that has eaten plastic waste. A recent study found that people who often consume seafood eat up to 11000 tiny pieces of plastic each year. Those living in parts of South East Asia and around the Mediterranean sea are most at risk.
The scale of these problems is worst in Asia’s developing economies. For example, a recent report from Pakistan stated that ‘Continued dumping of plastic products has become a serious threat to animals and plants inhabiting coastal and offshore waters. People do not seem to understand how damaging plastic waste is for the oceans.’ This is a typical concern; significantly, no solutions to these problems have been proposed by Pakistan’s government.
One possible way to tackle the problem is to introduce a ‘bottle tax’ on drinks that are sold in plastic bottles. The amount of tax would ideally depend on the size of the bottle, for example being $0.10 for a one litre bottle and $0.20 for a two litre bottle.
The UK government is considering imposing a ‘deposit return’ scheme similar to those that are successfully operating in Denmark, Germany and Sweden. Customers would pay a deposit when buying drinks in plastic bottles and are refunded the deposit if they return the empty plastic bottles to a retailer.
In most developed countries the legal disposal of plastic waste is heavily regulated. The most common method of disposal is for plastic waste to be buried in landfill sites. Interestingly, in China and India, landfill sites often have very few plastic bottles because people collect bottles and sell them to gain a source of income.
Another solution to the problem of plastic waste is to create a new product by recycling the plastic; more research needs to be carried out to evaluate this option, but this research is expensive and beyond the reach of many developing economies.
The demand for plastic products is forecast to increase due to its widespread use in agriculture, manufacturing and retailing. Unless something is done about the problems of disposal, even more plastic rubbish will find its way into our oceans. The key issue for many of Asia’s developing economies is that their options appear to be limited.

Interestingly, in China and India, landfill sites often have very few plastic bottles because people collect bottles and sell them to gain a source of income.
Another solution to the problem of plastic waste is to create a new product by recycling the plastic; more research needs to be carried out to evaluate this option, but this research is expensive and beyond the reach of many developing economies.
The demand for plastic products is forecast to increase due to its widespread use in agriculture, manufacturing and retailing. Unless something is done about the problems of disposal, even more plastic rubbish will find its way into our oceans. The key issue for many of Asia’s developing economies is that their options appear to be limited.

944,"Argentina raises interest rates to 40 per cent
Fig. 1.1: Argentina's exchange rate (pesos per US dollar), May 2016 to May 2018
On 4 May 2018, Argentina's central bank raised interest rates to 40%. The day before this increase they were raised from 30.25% to 33.25%. A week earlier, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises were aimed at supporting Argentina's currency, the peso, which lost a quarter of its value over the previous year. Despite these rises, the peso, which before the economic turmoil in Argentina in 2001–2002 was fixed at parity with the US dollar, was trading at about 22 pesos to the US dollar. Risks to the peso had been developing for some time. These included large budget and current account deficits, a heavy government debt burden, persistent high inflation and an overvalued currency. 
Inflation, a long-standing problem in Argentina, was 25% in 2017, the highest annual rate in South America except for Venezuela. The central bank has set an annual inflation target of 15% and has stated it will continue to take measures to achieve it.
Argentina's new president is pursuing a pro-market economic reform programme, seeking to reverse the protectionism and high government spending of previous governments. The president has pledged to reduce government spending drastically. The political opposition wants to stop him from removing subsidies on a range of basic household products, including gas and electricity. Removing the subsidies may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from its current high level to an annual rate of about 5% by 2020.
International and domestic investors still believe the president has a good plan for Argentina'seconomic recovery, but they are not convinced he has enough political support to achieve it.

In the extract it is stated that risks to the peso have been developing for some time and that large budget and current account deficits are some of these risks.

This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms. Expensive electricity production has driven industries abroad which has resulted in a loss of income and jobs. By 2020 it is estimated that small businesses will be paying 77% more per unit for electricity. The poor and the elderly have been hit hardest by high electricity bills.

The owner of one of Nigeria's largest companies has stressed the enormous economic progress that the country has made in recent years: ""I'm a great believer in Nigeria because the opportunities here are enormous."" His company's success shows what private enterprise can achieve in a mixed economy especially if it is provided with the right incentives by the government.
Most Nigerian entrepreneurs are operating in Lagos and entrepreneurship has certainlyplayed a key role in the modern Lagos economy. Start-up initiatives have been encouragedand the need to be innovative has been increasingly recognised, leading to the developmentof new goods, services and markets. The city is the centre of thriving music, fashion, film andtechnology industries that have significant influence throughout Africa.
A 'free trade zone' on the edge of Lagos has been established where private sector firms pay no business taxes to the government and there are now numerous start-up enterprises that are thriving. The government aims to lower costs, reduce bureaucracy and make the economy more flexible and efficient with the hope of boosting trade. The zone is located next to a deep sea port and has good road connections with both the rest of Nigeria and other countries in the region.
Lagos is an important transport hub, with three major ports and West Africa's most important international airport. In 2016 the output of Lagos was valued at US$136 billion while Nigeria's total national output was valued at US$405 billion. 
A former governor of the Nigerian central bank, has stated: ""Since 2000, Lagos has been transformed. In terms of an improved infrastructure and a supportive economic environment, the government has given firms a greater opportunity to thrive.""

The wind farms cost a lot to build and maintain. However,as the wind is free, the companies pay nothing for fuel and can sell electricity at very low prices –when the wind is blowing. This destroys any incentive to build power stations that combine the use of wind and gas because when the wind blows the gas unit is switched off and the return on the investment in gas is zero or negative.This has meant that the gradual replacement of coal-fired power by more efficient gas-fired power is not progressing and, as a result, there is no significant cut in carbon dioxide emissions.Prices charged for electricity not produced by wind farms have been rising because government support for the electricity industry has been directed to the wind farms. Expensive electricity production has driven industries abroad which has resulted in a loss of income and jobs. By 2020 it is estimated that small businesses will be paying 77% more per unit for electricity. The poor and the elderly have been hit hardest by high electricity bills.

980,"Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices. Further, the incentives and marketing discounts used by the scheme are often thought to be confusing and make it more difficult for the consumer to compare prices. There are risks for retailers too. It requires substantial investment to run such a scheme – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. 
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? The relative importance of factors that influence consumers when choosing from which shop to buy groceries are one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies who have invested in card schemes use them as a means to gather data on customers. When the loyalty card is used the retailer can see what the customer prefers to buy and can direct future offers to their wants in specific promotions both on-line and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers' wants. 
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. However, many purchases are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.
Source: RSA Journal 1, 2001, page 83

",What evidence is there in the article to suggest that loyalty cards make markets imperfectly competitive? [4],"a
• Create barriers to competition by reducing switches in demand,• Costs of scheme funded by higher prices• not affordable by smaller firms – high initial costs, $60m for one supermarket,• Causes confusion of information leading to imperfect knowledge.

982,"Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be thought of either in relation to card schemes which offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer, emotional loyalty where customers are loyal to a particular brand, or as a monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand. 
Retailers recognise that price has an importance in consumers' choice. Many supermarkets use loyalty cards to attract customers with promotions and price reductions available only to those who have a card. 
By using cards, supermarkets seek a marketing advantage and attempt to build barriers between retailers. Research indicates, however, that although 70% of United Kingdom (UK) consumers hold some kind of loyalty card, only about 10% are loyal to one particular card. 
Concerns have been raised that, when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card schemes may act as a constraint on free competition and prevent switching between brands. It is also thought that the costs of the scheme might be funded through higher prices. Further, the incentives and marketing discounts used by the scheme are often thought to be confusing and make it more difficult for the consumer to compare prices. There are risks for retailers too. It requires substantial investment to run such a scheme – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. 
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? The relative importance of factors that influence consumers when choosing from which shop to buy groceries are one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies who have invested in card schemes use them as a means to gather data on customers. When the loyalty card is used the retailer can see what the customer prefers to buy and can direct future offers to their wants in specific promotions both on-line and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers' wants. 
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. However, many purchases are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

",Consider whether there is conflicting evidence in the article about the effectiveness of loyalty cards which offer price discounts. [5],"c
Evidence for the effectiveness of cards:• Cards enable retailers to find out about consumer wants and target promotions;• Article also says retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through cards. (2)In contrast to that it also says• Price is not most significant factor in determining choice;• Also there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit, or has low emotional involvement. (2)Conclusion: seems to be some conflict. (1)

984,"Economic recovery painsSince the world financial crisis of 2008 the United Kingdom (UK) economy has recovered more quickly than some other advanced economies but the recovery has been uneven.In 2010 the UK government aimed to reduce a huge government debt by cutting government expenditure and by increasing economic growth through encouraging more private sector activity.By 2014 total unemployment in the UK fell below two million for the first time since 2008. This economic recovery was due especially to an increase in jobs in the private sector, mainly in service industries. This increase outweighed the loss of jobs, such as hospital workers, in the public sector. A government spokesperson said 'every job created is a family made more secure and a step towards a stronger economy.'Monetary policy was also aimed at economic recovery. The central bank fixed interest rates at their lowest ever level of 0.5%. It expanded the money supply through quantitative easing.To do so the central bank purchased huge quantities of government bonds to increase liquidity in the economy through the commercial banking system.However, some critics of the government's macroeconomic aims were of the opinion that recovery in the economy was uneven. In 2014 only the services sector output exceeded its pre-2008 peak. Industrial production, construction and agriculture each failed to reach pre-2008 levels of output.Further, for UK households, there was a reduction in real household incomes and, although unemployment decreased, UK households faced a fall in living standards. Households feared that interest rates would rise and they were also wary that inflation could fall further and there might be deflation. Businesses were concerned that their main export markets in Europe would decline if the UK pound (£) continued to strengthen against the euro due to the UK's relatively stronger economic growth.Table 1 Selected UK economic indicators for 2008 and 2014

The increase reflected positive contributions from consumption expenditure and company investment. These were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and government spending.

992,"Difficult times for OPEC and Nigeria
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has 13 members and produces over 30 million barrels of oil a day, responsible for half of global production. Its members, strongly influenced by Saudi Arabia, seek to limit the supply of oil in order to sustain stable prices to aid their own economic development.
OPEC members have become concerned about the increase in oil production in the United States (US) due to the use of fracking (a new technique for extracting oil) and its impact on world oil prices and OPEC's own market share. In 2014, OPEC decided to increase its own supply of oil in a bid to bankrupt higher-cost US producers. The effects were remarkable. A 12% increase in OPEC's production saw the world price fall by around 60% to less than US$30 per barrel. This was much lower than US producers' costs but it led to a 45% cut in OPEC's oil revenue.
In late 2016, it was clear that governments in OPEC countries were suffering from reduced oil revenues. There was also growing evidence that US oil producers had been able to cut costs to remain competitive with OPEC, even though the world price was still well below US$50 per barrel. This was thought to be the minimum price for producing oil in the US. In a surprising change of policy, OPEC decided to cut its oil production by 3%. The result was a 10% increase in the world price of oil.
Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. It produces around 8% of OPEC's total oil supply which accounts for over 80% of Nigeria's export revenue. Nigeria's economy has been seriously affected by OPEC's decision to increase supply on the world market. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a measure of total national output, has continued to fall along with oil output. The slowdown in the economy has affected taxation paid to the government. In addition import restrictions have been put in place to try to offset a severe shortage of foreign currency.

A 12% increase in OPEC's production saw the world price fall by around 60% to less than US$30 per barrel. This was much lower than US producers' costs but it led to a 45% cut in OPEC's oil revenue.
In late 2016, it was clear that governments in OPEC countries were suffering from reduced oil revenues. There was also growing evidence that US oil producers had been able to cut costs to remain competitive with OPEC, even though the world price was still well below US$50 per barrel. This was thought to be the minimum price for producing oil in the US. In a surprising change of policy, OPEC decided to cut its oil production by 3%. The result was a 10% increase in the world price of oil.
Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. It produces around 8% of OPEC's total oil supply which accounts for over 80% of Nigeria's export revenue. Nigeria's economy has been seriously affected by OPEC's decision to increase supply on the world market. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a measure of total national output, has continued to fall along with oil output. The slowdown in the economy has affected taxation paid to the government. In addition import restrictions have been put in place to try to offset a severe shortage of foreign currency.

In 2014, OPEC's policy has been to increase its supply of oil on the world market. This can be represented by a shift to the right of the world supply curve, producing a new equilibrium position with a lower price but an increase in the quantity of oil traded. In 2016, OPEC decided to reduce supply. This can be shown with a shift to the left of the world supply curve, leading to a fall in supply and a rise in the world price. Two correct diagrams or a combined diagram is acceptable.

The data states that OPEC produces half of the global production of oil. By varying the volume of production it can influence the market price.

Egypt's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) reported that Egypt's annual inflation rate surged to 32.9% in April 2017, compared to 10.9% in 2016. This is considerably higher than the expected rate that was estimated by the IMF shown in Table 1.1.
Inflation had been rising in Egypt since the decision of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) in November 2016 to float Egypt's currency (the Egyptian pound) in a move that caused a 50% depreciation in its value against the US dollar. This came as part of the Egyptian government's reform programme, started in 2014, to reduce the budget deficit and acquire a US$12 billion loan from the IMF to ease the US dollar shortage that had restricted Egypt's business activity.
A macroeconomic research group has said that 'The sharp rise in inflation could largely be attributed to the effects of the weaker Egyptian pound. Inflation was also made worse by levying a new indirect tax called Value Added Tax (VAT), and cutting subsidies on energy in November 2016.' On the same day as the CBE floated the Egyptian pound it raised the interest rate by 3 percentage points to 14.75%.
Egypt's VAT replaced the previous sales tax, which economists said created market distortions. It was expected to broaden the tax base in a country where the government struggles to collect income tax because of a large informal economy and widespread tax avoidance. The VAT does not apply to basic goods and services to protect the poor.

6
The unemployment rate is expected to fall from 2016. As a result, incomes will rise and it would be expected that imports would also rise. In addition, goods formerly exported would be diverted to satisfy rising demand in the home market. Net exports would decrease as a result and the current account balance become an increasing deficit. Alternatively, it could be argued that those who enter employment will boost production and this could offset imports or boost exports. Explanations developed along these lines are equally acceptable. Some candidates might offer the view that either outcome is possible. These approaches should also be credited. Up to 4 marks are available for explaining the link between the changes in unemployment and the current account balance. Two further marks are reserved for elaboration that considers any factors that the outcome of the change depends upon e.gs include the imposition of import controls, the income elasticity of demand for imports, exchange rate changes, the availability of other factors in the production process such as capital goods and the time period under consideration.

*International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates
Source: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2017
Egypt's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) reported that Egypt's annual inflation rate surged to 32.9% in April 2017, compared to 10.9% in 2016. This is considerably higher than the expected rate that was estimated by the IMF shown in Table 1.1.
Inflation had been rising in Egypt since the decision of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) in November 2016 to float Egypt's currency (the Egyptian pound) in a move that caused a 50% depreciation in its value against the US dollar. This came as part of the Egyptian government's reform programme, started in 2014, to reduce the budget deficit and acquire a US$12 billion loan from the IMF to ease the US dollar shortage that had restricted Egypt's business activity.
A macroeconomic research group has said that 'The sharp rise in inflation could largely be attributed to the effects of the weaker Egyptian pound. Inflation was also made worse by levying a new indirect tax called Value Added Tax (VAT), and cutting subsidies on energy in November 2016.' On the same day as the CBE floated the Egyptian pound it raised the interest rate by 3 percentage points to 14.75%.
Egypt's VAT replaced the previous sales tax, which economists said created market distortions. It was expected to broaden the tax base in a country where the government struggles to collect income tax because of a large informal economy and widespread tax avoidance. The VAT does not apply to basic goods and services to protect the poor.

The fiscal and monetary changes referred to in the text include reducing the budget deficit, levying a new indirect tax, cutting subsidies on energy, raising interest rates and floating the Egyptian pound. Some of these changes will help to cure inflation, but others will exacerbate the problem. For example: As far as fiscal policy measures are concerned the data refers to a reduction in the budget deficit. This might help to cure inflation. On the other hand the rise in VAT and the cut in subsidies will cause a rise in prices. So these fiscal policy measures work in opposing directions. As far as monetary policy measures are concerned, a rise in interest rates might help to cure inflation, but the fall in the value of the Egyptian pound might cause cost-push inflation. Again these monetary measures work in opposing directions. Some candidates might explain how a policy is expected to work (1 mark) they then need to consider why it might not work (1 mark).Other candidates might explain why a measure might not work (1 mark).

1004,"Trade tensions between China and the United States
At a World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland in 2017, the Chinese President re-affirmed his country's commitment to free trade and pledged never to start a protectionist 'trade war' or to benefit from a devaluation of its currency, the yuan. Meanwhile, the United States (US) President stated that the 'America First' doctrine means increased protectionism and he repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs and import quotas on Chinese goods. 
During 2016, the value of the US dollar rose against most currencies. In contrast, the Chinese yuan weakened significantly from 6.20 yuan per US dollar at the end of 2014 to 6.95 yuan at the end of 2016. The US President has accused China of intentionally devaluing the yuan in order to boost China's export competitiveness. Despite strong downward pressure on its currency, China has attempted to keep the yuan–US dollar exchange rate relatively stable, costing more than US$2 trillion of its official foreign exchange reserves. China has stated that it does not want the yuan to fall in value any more than the US does, but no country has complete control over its exchange rate.
China, like Japan and Germany, usually has a current account surplus on the balance of payments, but China's current account surplus as a percentage of GDP fell in 2016 and the International Monetary Fund expects it to decrease further, as exports continue to fall.
There are three policy paths that a country can follow with regard to its exchange rate: a completely free float, a managed float or a fixed (pegged) exchange rate. Each of these has various advantages and disadvantages. At present, China's policy is a managed float, but some economists have argued that it is the yuan–US dollar exchange rate that is regarded as being especially important and so it might be better if China decided to fix (peg) the yuan to the dollar. Fig. 1.1 shows the yuan–US dollar exchange rate over three years.

A disadvantage of having a persistent current account surplus is that one country's surplus is another country's deficit. The country with the deficit may decide to introduce protectionist methods, potentially damaging the extent of international trade.

Explain two likely reasons why China has opted for a managed float exchange rate system. For example: • The government will still have some influence. • The central bank will be able to influence exchange rate by intervention, e.g. buying/selling currencies or by changes in interest rates. • Extent of float will be within certain limits. • The government will be able to influence an economy through demand management. • A managed float will allow an economy to have the best of both worlds (floating/fixed).

A free floating exchange rate system will be selfadjusting, but freely floating exchange rates tend to be rather volatile and unstable. A pegged (fixed) exchange rate system will provide stability and therefore confidence, but the maintenance of this exchange rate could require extensive support through the use of reserves. Some reserves will be needed (US $2 trillion in the case of China), but given that there is limited floating, not as much reserves as in the case of a pegged (fixed) exchange rate system; there is greater stability than in a freely floating system, but not as much as in a pegged (fixed) exchange rate system.

1009,"Inequalities of wealth
In 2015, the vast and growing gap between rich and poor was revealed in a report from the charity Oxfam.
Oxfam said that between 2010 and 2015, the total wealth of the world's poorest 50% had fallen. In the same period, the wealth of the world's richest people had increased. In 2010, the 388 richest people in the world owned the same wealth as the poorest 50%. This fell to 80 people in 2014 and to only 62 people by 2015.
The report recommended that governments should do three things: make greater attempts to prevent tax avoidance; invest more in public services; and ensure there are higher wages for the low paid.
On taxes, the report emphasised the need to end the use of tax havens to hide large amounts of money. It estimated that the use of tax havens by multinational companies denies developing countries at least US$100 billion a year in tax revenue. In tax havens, which include the Cayman Islands, Dubai, Hong Kong, Liberia, Luxembourg, Singapore and Switzerland, taxes are either non-existent or levied at a low rate.
The Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean, refers to itself as an 'international financial centre'. Almost 20000 international companies are registered there. An official explained its function is to assist global capitalism to work. For example, if an American company and a Japanese company agree a business deal in their own countries they would pay tax. They would be more likely to agree the deal if it were done through a company in the Cayman Islands where no tax is paid.
It is not only the developed world which makes use of tax havens. Oxfam reported that as much as 30% of all African financial wealth was thought to be held in tax havens. The estimated loss of US$14 billion in tax revenues would be enough to pay for healthcare that could save the lives of 4 million children a year and employ enough teachers to get every African child into school.
To help the lowest income earners in society, government social welfare spending has become more important than ever. As well as preventing tax avoidance, a traditional cure for the problems from rising inequality has been to redistribute income through taxation from the richest to the poorest. However, this can lead to resentment and can impede economic growth.
A better cure would be to encourage innovation that would benefit everybody. A combination of the internet and computer revolutions is transforming the world economy which has led to economic growth. Inevitably the leaders of these kinds of enterprises have become some of the world's richest entrepreneurs.

",Use the evidence in the article to consider the effect on business activity of using tax havens. [6],"c
Tax havens assist global capitalism to work: Businesses need to be encouraged to take risks and innovation and thereby increase the size of national income through the investment multiplier. This creates employment through an increase in AD. More likely to undertake deals if tax is low. Effect of this is weakened if MNCs pay low wages and send profits to tax havens. Positive link: Tax havens are used by entrepreneurs/MNC's to shelter incomes from taxation. These incomes could be used as investments by the MNC's to create further wealth in countries where they operate. Negative link: Income inequalities are becoming greater between rich and poor in both developed and developing countries. Taxes create resentment and may prevent investment and impede economic growth.

",Discuss the economic consequences for governments whose citizens and businesses avoid paying tax on a high proportion of their incomes or profits. [6],"d
Governments face a shortfall in revenue. Therefore to cover government expenditure they need to borrow more because tax revenues are below potential. Education suffers, health care suffers. If the 'rich' do not pay sufficient tax there is an opportunity cost. Provision of welfare programmes, education, health provided by governments will be affected. Quote examples from text e.g. African countries. Governments incur administrative costs trying to recover tax which could be better spent on services. Government's macro-aims are affected e.g. capital outflows create balance of payments deficits. Governments may have to make welfare payments to unemployed workers if MNCs fail to invest profits back into the businesses where they were generated. But paying lower taxes could be profitable for companies who might then reinvest, research more and employ more people.

1013,"Infrastructure is restricting Indonesia's economic development
One feature of Indonesia's economy that has been hampering its economic and social development is the lack of quality and quantity of its infrastructure, whether it is 'hard' like roads or 'soft' like education.
In recent years the Indonesian government has given infrastructure a relatively small allocation of public spending. In 2011 only 2.1% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was reserved for infrastructure. In comparison, countries such as China and India spend almost 10% of their GDP on infrastructure. Since the late 1990s expansion of Indonesia’s infrastructure has not matched macroeconomic expansion, and as a consequence economic growth has not reached its full potential. It is estimated that GDP could grow at 1%–2.5% more than the current annual rate.
Lack of adequate infrastructure causes distribution costs such as transport and warehousing to rise steeply, thus reducing Indonesia's competitiveness and attractiveness as an investment location. According to data published by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin Indonesia), around 17% of a typical company's total expenditure is absorbed by such costs. In other south-east Asian economies this is below 10%. In particular transport costs are high; by land as well as sea. Despite Indonesia's island geography, sea transport is yet to be developed substantially. Currently, sea transport is even more expensive than land transport. This results in inflationary pressures on domestically produced products. It partly explains why some domestically grown fruit is more expensive than imported fruit.

It also prevents businesses from expanding and profitable opportunities are lost.
Indonesia suffers from inadequacies in the country's electricity supply, despite the abundance of energy resources. Part of the problem is that the state-owned electricity distributor, which has a monopoly on electricity distribution, is heavily dependent on government subsidies as the cost of production is higher than the fixed maximum selling price.
Soft infrastructure such as education, healthcare and social welfare is also under-developed. The government has made efforts to improve these areas in recent years. A new healthcare system is about to be introduced covering all Indonesians and spending on education has increased markedly.

1014,"Infrastructure is restricting Indonesia's economic development
One feature of Indonesia's economy that has been hampering its economic and social development is the lack of quality and quantity of its infrastructure, whether it is 'hard' like roads or 'soft' like education.
In recent years the Indonesian government has given infrastructure a relatively small allocation of public spending. In 2011 only 2.1% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was reserved for infrastructure. In comparison, countries such as China and India spend almost 10% of their GDP on infrastructure. Since the late 1990s expansion of Indonesia’s infrastructure has not matched macroeconomic expansion, and as a consequence economic growth has not reached its full potential. It is estimated that GDP could grow at 1%–2.5% more than the current annual rate.
Lack of adequate infrastructure causes distribution costs such as transport and warehousing to rise steeply, thus reducing Indonesia's competitiveness and attractiveness as an investment location. According to data published by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin Indonesia), around 17% of a typical company's total expenditure is absorbed by such costs. In other south-east Asian economies this is below 10%. In particular transport costs are high; by land as well as sea. Despite Indonesia's island geography, sea transport is yet to be developed substantially. Currently, sea transport is even more expensive than land transport. This results in inflationary pressures on domestically produced products. It partly explains why some domestically grown fruit is more expensive than imported fruit. It also leads to substantial regional price differences. Rice, for example, is much more expensive in eastern Indonesia than in Java or Sumatra. It also prevents businesses from expanding and profitable opportunities are lost.

European countries have some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the world. They also have some of the highest life expectancy figures at birth – averaging 81 years compared with 71 years for the world as a whole. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to improved healthcare, decreased deaths from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. But a World Health Organisation (WHO) report warned that all of that progress could be overturned within a generation if the unhealthy lifestyle of many Europeans is not addressed.
The report stated that Europe has the highest rates of smoking and alcohol consumption of any region in the world and is second for obesity after the Americas. This lifestyle will mean that life expectancy will decline over the next generation. Table 1.1 gives GDP per capita and health statistics for some European countries.

To try and limit smoking, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has conducted advertising campaigns warning of the dangers of smoking and banned smoking in public places. It has also put high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, it has refused to place a tax on all sugar consumption and there are no minimum prices for alcohol.

",Discuss whether the information supports the view that higher incomes increase consumer well-being. [6],"c
Positive supportive factors: Table shows countries with high per capita incomes do have high life expectancy rates at birth. Assumption is that higher life expectancy increases well-being. The information mentions higher levels of education, housing, health care – development of medicine to lower heart disease, diabetes and lung disease. Negative factors: Life style of richer countries – high smoking rates, high alcohol consumption, high sugar intakes leading to poorer health and a reduction in life expectancy. Conclusion: Wellbeing not just linked to income though too little income negates it. Income level of $10 000 is arbitrary and subjective. Higher satisfaction maybe due to socio-economic factors such as strong family support, growing own fruit and vegetables, healthier lifestyles.

","Explain, according to indifference curve analysis, what happens to a consumer's satisfaction and demand as income rises. Consider whether the evidence in Table 1.1 about income levels, as shown by GDP per capita, and smoking, is sufficient to support that analysis. [7]","d
Indifference curve analysis states that as income increases consumers move to a new, 'higher' indifference curve and this gives more satisfaction. For normal goods the consumption would also increase as incomes increase. A diagram is not required but it is likely that candidates would explain the analysis with a diagram. Evidence is that higher incomes do not necessarily result in a higher proportion of the population smoking. The evidence is inconclusive whether a higher level of income for an individual resulted in an increased demand (as would be expected by the theory) as the figures are overall averages and show differences between countries rather than an increase in income in any one country.

The most likely outcome is that the Canadian market will be flooded with cheap food imports from other members of the TPP, especially New Zealand. If so, this will reduce prices and the incomes of those farmers who produce similar products. It could also be argued that membership of the TPP provides new opportunities for Canada's farmers with tariff and quota free access to new markets within the TPP. This could have a positive effect on certain farm incomes. Overall outcome though is uncertain.

There are both costs and benefits that could result if China joined the TPP: Possible costs include : the domestic market could be flooded with cheap imports; there might be increased balance of trade deficits, infant industries might be prevented from development and so on. Possible benefits include : tariff free access to the massive Chinese market; increase in scale of production of exporting industries leading to economies of scale and so on.

Extract 1: Thailand's economy shows improved health
The latest figures show that Thailand's economy grew by 3.5% in the second quarter, putting it on track for 3–3.5% growth for the whole of 2016. Thailand has managed to boost its growth after several quarters of disappointing performance by increasing public sector investment in several large infrastructure projects, including roads, railways and airports. These projects will run over the next 3 to 5 years and are worth several hundred billion baht, Thailand's currency. It is hoped that this public sector investment will encourage the private sector to increase their investment spending.
In addition to increased investment, the Thai economy's growth is being boosted by recovering private consumption due to increases in farm prices, which are crucial to household purchasing power, as well as a strong tourism sector.
Regarding the export sector, which remains the biggest engine of growth, the outlook is still uncertain but the negative impact from China's economic slowdown appears to have stabilised with a Chinese growth rate of around 6.6% per annum.

Extract 2: Thailand's tourism industry continues to grow
The Thai tourism industry is projected to record international visitor arrivals of 16.67 million between January and June 2016, which will be up by 13% over the same period of 2015. Projected earnings are estimated at 824 billion baht, up 17%. The top three markets in terms of tourism receipts are projected to be China (146 billion baht, +32%), Malaysia (22.5 billion baht, +15%) and Australia (17.8 billion baht, +4%). China is now by far the largest source of visitors, but there has been a resumption of growth from Russia and Thailand’s neighbouring countries of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

Thailand is a very open economy that depends upon tourism for its export income. This allows for the import of many goods that are not produced efficiently in Thailand. This is effectively a reflection of comparative advantage and allows for an improved standard of living in Thailand. The danger is that the external balance can be influenced by world events and changes in export earnings can have serious consequences.

1033,"Airport Expansion
In 2014, a proposal by Heathrow Airport Authority (HAA) in London recommended building an extra runway at Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. HAA acknowledged that it was an initial proposal that needed more detailed work.
They claimed that, if built, the runway would deliver greater economic benefits and be a better option for economic growth for the UK than any other proposal for new airport capacity. HAA was not able to quantify the benefits with any precision but said they would range from £50 billion to £156 billion (US$84 billion to US$262 billion) with a ‘central estimate’ of over £100 billion (US$168 billion). The majority would benefit the wider economy by creating jobs, encouraging trade, boosting spending and improving public finances. The proposal would allow the airport to be connected to more emerging markets and enable 40 new destinations to be served directly, including some in India and China. Cargo volumes would double and UK competitiveness would increase.
HAA added that more efficient vehicles, an increased proportion of passengers travelling by public transport and new aircraft technology would mean that the extra flights would not exceed the European Union pollution limits.
In order to build the new runway, major motorways would need to be altered. Many homes would have to be demolished but the airport said they would pay the owners 25% above the property’s market value. When it was built, car drivers wishing to take passengers to the airport would have to pay a congestion charge.
Those opposing the new runway said that thousands of people would be forced out of their homes and communities would be destroyed and, while waiting for a decision to be made, they would be unable to sell their homes. 240 000 people would suffer from airport noise.
HAA said the runway would cost £15.6 billion (US$26.2 billion) to build, with the government paying £1.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) towards the motorway alterations.
There were alternative proposals. The first was to build a completely new airport to the east of Heathrow. The second was to add another runway to an existing airport, Gatwick, to the south of Heathrow.
HAA argued that a completely new airport would take much longer to build and be more expensive than an extra runway and would mean higher fares for passengers.
The owners of Gatwick Airport insisted that the new runway at Heathrow was not in the best interest of passengers and that Gatwick would be better able to offer lower fares and connect to emerging markets with longer-range aircraft. They said that their plans were cheaper – £7.8 billion (US$13.1 billion) – and could be built quicker than the Heathrow option, with less disruption to motorways. Noise from another runway at Gatwick would also affect fewer people – 14 000, not 240 000.

1037,"Housing and Economic Growth in the UK
In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.
An economist said that the most effective intervention a government can make in the housing market is to relax the planning system and make it easier and cheaper to build more homes. Increased supply, leading to lower prices, would encourage demand. Others said that ‘although there is talk of a large rise in the price of houses, it is not uniform throughout the country and trying to influence the basic laws of supply and demand is not the right way of tackling the problem.’
The buying of housing gives rise to increased consumer spending and some argue that this helps the economy. Although policies by the government and the central bank had increased consumer demand and spending, such expenditure is quite different from the export-led growth model preferred by the government. Analysts suggested that the demand and supply conditions causing the current situation cannot last forever. When they end, the effect on the housing market (which by then will have many people with very high debts) will be very bad for the economy. This can be seen in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where property values are in decline.

In 2013 a press article reported that 'there has been a marked improvement in the housing market'. Potential buyers of housing had been encouraged because the central bank had fixed interest rates at an all-time low and also by a government scheme designed to give help to people wishing to buy property. The scheme meant that buyers did not have to find such a large deposit.
This caused a positive outcome for the construction industry, with investment and employment rising. However, it pushed up property prices. 
In 2013 the average price of a house was seven times the average wage. A study recommended that the central bank should take steps to prevent house prices rising by more than 5% a year and should limit the amount people could borrow relative to their incomes. There should be regional variations to this limit, as property prices do not increase at the same rate in every region.
However, a deputy governor of the central bank said that limiting price rises would not solve the cause of the problem, which was the lack of new property development. He found it surprising that the study chose to focus exclusively on the demand side when the underlying problem was one of supply.

","Using the evidence in the article, assess whether it contradicts the view that an increase in house prices is an improvement for an economy. [6]","c
Not necessarily linked to income growth, average house prices risen to seven times the average wage, there is an increase in debt which is excessive compared with incomes, creates inequality in wealth, might easily reverse – as in Spain and Netherlands – causing financial crisis, not stable in the long term.

1041,"Pay and the rate of inflation
In the United Kingdom (UK) in the last three months of 2014 the employment rate was at a record high (73.2%) and total pay had its highest increase since before the world financial crisis. Total pay (regular pay plus bonuses) rose by an average of 2.1% between October and December 2014. This was partly because of a large growth in bonus payments in the private sector. Average weekly regular pay rose by 1.7% in that period.
Private sector total pay rose by an average of 2.5% while workers who were employed in the public sector saw average total pay growth of only 0.7% because of government controls over pay and an absence of bonuses.
By comparison, annual inflation fell to 0.5% in December 2014 and to 0.3% in January 2015. The Prime Minister said that high employment, stronger productivity and low inflation rates are key matters helping economic recovery and an increase in living standards. However, while total hours worked grew by 0.8% in the last three months of 2014, GDP growth was 0.5% implying that output per head fell over the quarter and the increased employment was not boosting labour productivity. This is not good for a long-term improvement in living standards even if inflation is very low.
The chief executive of an oil company said that oil companies will have to adapt to a new era of lower prices and a greater emphasis on reducing carbon emissions in order to survive. This is already happening by way of short-term market forces as costs of production come down but long-term structural changes will be needed. His remarks came after two international oil companies announced large reductions in both fixed and variable costs as oil prices fell by 50% in the last six months of 2014 amid a surplus of supply and reduced demand.

1045,"Monetary policy and economic growth
Between 2009 and 2014, the central bank of the United Kingdom (UK) used policy measures of quantitative easing (QE) and very low interest rates. The Finance Minister said that monetary policy was the primary tool for encouraging investment that could lead to economic growth. Private businesses, however, said that QE by itself cannot restore confidence in the economy. It needs to be supported by a range of supply-side policies, in particular policies to help small firms access credit. Pension fund companies also did not welcome the policy and said that it penalised those who rely on their savings for income.
A policy of QE was also followed by the United States (US) central bank but was criticised by other central banks and governments in the emerging markets. They argued that the extra money was depressing the value of the US dollar on the exchange markets. This may have increased US competitiveness but it did not help economic development in the rest of the world as their products became relatively more expensive.
By contrast, it was suggested that the greatest threat to global economic development was the culture of risk aversion among companies. This meant that too many were concentrating on managing costs while failing to invest sufficiently. The aim seemed to be to reduce costs rather than create new revenue. When growth is slow companies often merge and consolidate, rather than make risky investments. This happened in food and beverages, construction, pharmaceuticals and the media.
One way to find new opportunities and encourage growth would be to look to emerging markets. They account for more than half of the global economy. However, in 2014 emerging markets were suffering large capital outflows, partly caused by the stronger US dollar and partly because of demographic factors. Population structure is vital to a nation's prosperity. A young workforce and a small proportion of retired people help the economy to grow.
One country that offers great potential is Nigeria. About 43% of its population is under the age of 15, and only 3% are aged over 65. Demographically it looks good.

1049,"Changes in the world oil market and their effects
Founded in 1960, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), consisted of five countries all of whom produced oil. OPEC's success, with Saudi Arabia as its market leader, encouraged other oil exporting countries to join. There are now 12 OPEC member countries, including Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC is responsible for over 35% of world oil production, working together to fix prices and control output.
OPEC has faced various external shocks. In recent years, the financial crisis 2008–2011 reduced global demand for oil. Also, since 2012, non-OPEC oil supplies have increased, as shown in Fig. 1, mainly due to the use of fracking – a process of extracting oil from rock using very expensive drilling equipment. This has happened in spite of opposition to fracking by environmentalists who accuse the fracking companies of causing minor earthquakes and polluting underground water sources.
The main oil producer using fracking is the United States (US) which has become almost self-sufficient in oil and consequently does not need to rely on OPEC. In 2014, the US even began to export its oil, especially to Europe as a rival to OPEC and Russia. This had an effect on the price of oil as shown on the chart in Fig. 2.
There have been both winners and losers from this change in production of oil. While all oil importing countries have become winners as the price of oil declines, undoubtedly the US has strengthened its economy the most. The fracking boom has increased consumer spending in the US, which has been a key element in the recovery of the US economy from the financial crisis.
The losers are OPEC's members that are dependent on oil as the main source of revenue. Nigeria greatly overestimated the price of oil and, as a result, it had to devalue its currency in November 2014, raise taxes on luxury items and cut government spending by 6%.

Despite the fall in oil prices, in January 2015 Saudi Arabia refused to agree to demands from other OPEC members to cut oil supplies in order to keep prices high. Saudi Arabia was happy to allow oil prices to fall further in order to put US fracking companies out of business.

Founded in 1960, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), consisted of five countries all of whom produced oil. OPEC's success, with Saudi Arabia as its market leader, encouraged other oil exporting countries to join. There are now 12 OPEC member countries, including Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC is responsible for over 35% of world oil production, working together to fix prices and control output.
OPEC has faced various external shocks. In recent years, the financial crisis 2008–2011 reduced global demand for oil. Also, since 2012, non-OPEC oil supplies have increased, as shown in Fig. 1, mainly due to the use of fracking – a process of extracting oil from rock using very expensive drilling equipment. This has happened in spite of opposition to fracking by environmentalists who accuse the fracking companies of causing minor earthquakes and polluting underground water sources.
The main oil producer using fracking is the United States (US) which has become almost self-sufficient in oil and consequently does not need to rely on OPEC. In 2014, the US even began to export its oil, especially to Europe as a rival to OPEC and Russia. This had an effect on the price of oil as shown on the chart in Fig. 2.

1053,"Zambia bears the brunt of China's economic slowdown
Fig. 1: Zambian kwacha and copper priceSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream
Zambia was one of Africa's main beneficiaries when China's economy was expanding. With copper its key export, China's huge demand for minerals helped the southern African nation enjoy a decade of economic boom. But as China's economy slows down, Zambia finds itself with real problems. A large mining group has announced it is to suspend production for 18 months. In addition, a Chinese-owned company has said it will suspend operations and cut jobs in Zambia because of the copper price. The situation highlights the vulnerability of Africa’s resource-dependent nations to the fortunes of China.
Zambia is Africa's second biggest copper producer and depends on the metal for about 70% of its foreign exchange earnings and 25–30% of government revenue. Copper prices have fallen 18% this year, sliding to a six year low of below US$5000 per tonne last month. As a result, Zambia has been ranked top of an index of African nations most exposed to China's slowdown. In 2012, Zambian exports to China amounted to 4.3% of Zambia's national income.
During the boom years, mining led to billions of dollars of investment. Much of this was foreign direct investment from China. The sector was a key driver of Zambia's economy, which grew by an annual average of 6.4% over the last decade – one of the world's fastest growth rates.
The Zambian government is now struggling to balance its budget. It is expected that the 2015 fiscal deficit will be much greater than previously estimated, and the government has pledged to reduce its spending. A further problem is that the weakness of Zambia's currency, the kwacha, risks feeding through into inflation.
The government has spoken of the need for economic diversification to reduce the country's dependence on copper. This is a tough task which China's slowdown has highlighted for many resource‑rich African nations.

The change in the value of the Kwacha is likely to cause cost-push inflation through the rise in import prices. There will be a rise in the price of imported raw materials and components used by Zambian businesses and pressure Upon the components of Zambian household expenditure. Theoretically, the decline in the Kwacha could generate demand-pull inflation, but given the context of the extract, this is unlikely.

reduce consumption because household incomes fall
reduce investment because business activity declines
increase government spending because welfare payments to the unemployed rise or through countercyclical government spending Or it may reduce government spending because as tax receipts will fall and the government will tighten its belt. Either is accepted as long as an explanation is included

Diversification of the Zambian economy implies that specialisation on copper production should be abandoned and other sectors developed.

As a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 both Iceland and the Republic of Ireland (RoI) had to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In total, Iceland borrowed US$4.6 billion, with US$2.1 billion of that coming from the IMF and the other US$2.5 billion from neighbouring Scandinavian countries. In exchange for help, Iceland was forced to sharply reduce government spending – introducing more austerity than the RoI did. Not only that, but Iceland also increased interest rates to 18% in the immediate aftermath of the crisis to reduce inflation. It gradually cut interest rates afterward, but it was not until 2011 that they fell to 4.25%.
The biggest difference between the two economies is that Iceland has its own currency, the krona. Iceland manages its foreign exchange rate through intervention in the foreign exchange market and through interest rate changes. Insufficient foreign exchange reserves meant that the value of the krona fell by nearly 60% between the end of 2007 and the end of 2008. The RoI, on the other hand, did not have its own currency that it could devalue. It is part of the eurozone, where each country uses the euro, and the RoI authorities have no control over its value.
Iceland's recovery has been better than the RoI’s despite the fact that Iceland’s recession was much more serious than the RoI’s. The Icelandic economy has recovered surprisingly strongly since 2010. The large devaluation of the krona against both the US dollar and the euro helped. There has been a big boost from tourism. Unemployment, which peaked at 9% of the workforce at the worst of the crisis, is now back down to 5%. In the RoI, unemployment is falling but is still 9.8% of the workforce. Iceland’s economy has now recovered roughly to its pre-crisis peak. The IMF predicts that Iceland’s output will grow by 3.5% this year. The current account deficit, which was 25% of national income in 2009, has been eliminated and there is now a current account surplus. The government also ran a budget surplus last year for the first time since the crisis.

The collapse of the Krona could cause cost-push and/or demand pull inflation. As the Krona collapses this makes imports more expensive. This might feed into increased costs for Icelandic companies as they import raw materials and components. In addition, there might be increases in the cost of living as imports might comprise foodstuffs and so on. In addition, the fall in the Krona would reduce the price of Iceland’s exports and increase the price of her imports that would lead to a rise in net exports and aggregate expenditure causing inflationary pressures.Give due credit to those answers that make good, appropriate use of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply framework although this is not essential for full marks.

Also relevant is whether the currencies of other countries lose value against the Krona. Candidates need to explain at least two factors for full marks. Marks will be awarded for development of each factor. The J-curve, the Marshall-Lerner condition and whether Iceland has the capacity to expand exports will be developed in high scoring answers.Identification of relevant factors with no explanation (1 mark only)Please note that this question concerns the factors that determine the impact of devaluation Upon a country's current account. There are no marks for explaining that export prices fall and import prices rise after devaluation.

Fig. 2: Inflation in Iceland 2007–2015Source: IMF
As a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 both Iceland and the Republic of Ireland (RoI) had to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In total, Iceland borrowed US$4.6 billion, with US$2.1 billion of that coming from the IMF and the other US$2.5 billion from neighbouring Scandinavian countries. In exchange for help, Iceland was forced to sharply reduce government spending – introducing more austerity than the RoI did. Not only that, but Iceland also increased interest rates to 18% in the immediate aftermath of the crisis to reduce inflation. It gradually cut interest rates afterward, but it was not until 2011 that they fell to 4.25%.
The biggest difference between the two economies is that Iceland has its own currency, the krona. Iceland manages its foreign exchange rate through intervention in the foreign exchange market and through interest rate changes. Insufficient foreign exchange reserves meant that the value of the krona fell by nearly 60% between the end of 2007 and the end of 2008. The RoI, on the other hand, did not have its own currency that it could devalue. It is part of the eurozone, where each country uses the euro, and the RoI authorities have no control over its value.
Iceland's recovery has been better than the RoI’s despite the fact that Iceland’s recession was much more serious than the RoI’s. The Icelandic economy has recovered surprisingly strongly since 2010. The large devaluation of the krona against both the US dollar and the euro helped. There has been a big boost from tourism. Unemployment, which peaked at 9% of the workforce at the worst of the crisis, is now back down to 5%. In the RoI, unemployment is falling but is still 9.8% of the workforce. Iceland’s economy has now recovered roughly to its pre-crisis peak. The IMF predicts that Iceland’s output will grow by 3.5% this year. The current account deficit, which was 25% of national income in 2009, has been eliminated and there is now a current account surplus. The government also ran a budget surplus last year for the first time since the crisis.

Iceland's exchange rate system is under the control of the Icelandic authorities. It is a managed exchange rate system. This means that Iceland has the option to vary the exchange rate to suit economic circumstances. The devaluation of the Krona has resulted in a current account surplus, falling unemployment and a budget surplus. These are the benefits of a managed exchange rate, but there are also costs. In order to manage the exchange rate, it is necessary to hold large quantities of foreign exchange reserves and these may not be sufficient to manage the exchange rate. In addition, in order to maintain a particular exchange rate it might be necessary to sacrifice other economic objectives. Iceland had to raise interest rates to very high levels and this would have resulted in some costs to consumers and businesses.This question does not require specific reference to Iceland. More general explanations of the costs and benefits of managing an economy's exchange rate are acceptable.Identification of a cost with no explanation (1 mark only)Identification of a benefit with no explanation (1 mark only)

1063,"Fall in price of oil but Colombia can look forward to growth
Fig. 1: Colombia's growth and the oil priceSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream
Fig. 2: Colombian peso against the US dollar (peso per US$), inverted scaleSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream
Over the past year, the halving of crude oil prices has hit Colombia and much of South America hard. Venezuela's economy, for example, is expected to shrink by 7% this year. Colombia's national oil production was running at 1 million barrels a year, accounting for half of its exports and a fifth of government revenues. In Puerto Gaitan, which only a year ago was the centre of Colombia's oil industry, the town's population had tripled to 45000 in just a few years. Property prices had soared and hotels overflowed. Today, though, business profits have fallen, leading to a fall in spending by entrepreneurs. ""For Sale"" signs now hang over Puerto Gaitan's closed stores, car parks in shopping malls are empty and 10000 people have left the town. Towns throughout Colombia are experiencing similar problems.
Colombia's government is feeling the effects as well. Every US$1 drop in the oil price per barrel cuts an estimated US$200 million from government revenues. As a result, the government has cut spending and raised taxes to keep its budget deficit down. More worryingly, the collapse in the price of oil has opened a large current account deficit equivalent to 7% of national income. Yet not all is bleak. Colombia's economy is forecast to grow this year. And unlike in neighbouring Venezuela, where oil accounts for more than 90% of exports, there is concern but no panic.
Firstly, the peso's depreciation could reverse Colombia's current account problems, boosting traditional exports such as coffee, textiles, car parts and flowers — if not to its immediate neighbours, then to the United States. Colombia produces oil, but it is not only an oil-producing country. Secondly, Colombia's government is having peace talks with Marxist rebels to end the country's five decades of unrest. The government's military expenditure will be reduced and estimates suggest that this 'peace dividend' could add as much as 2 percentage points to growth.

1068,"Argentina announces lifting of currency controlsArgentina's new government has removed foreign currency controls, allowing its citizens to buy US dollars freely for the first time in four years. These currency controls have been in place as part of a fixed exchange rate system. The move, which officials hope will boost the faltering economy, is the strongest President Macri has yet made in his bid to reduce the government interference that marked the country's economy under the previous presidencies. Removing foreign currency controls was the latest in a series of moves President Macri has made since he took office. His administration has also eliminated most farm export taxes and cut personal income taxes.The decision carries significant short term risks but equally big long term rewards if it leads to greater investment and lifts the country's failing export sector.In the short term, the move is likely to cause the biggest currency depreciation since Argentina's economic meltdown in 2002.Economists expect the Argentinian currency, the peso, to fall from its current official exchange rate of US$1 = 9.8 peso to something closer to the rate used in the black (illegal) market, about US$1 = 14.5 peso. This would be a fall of a third of its value.Lifting foreign currency controls came on the same day the US central bank raised its interest rate for the first time since 2006, making it relatively harder for other countries, including Argentina, to attract funds. A weaker peso will add to the country's already high inflation rate of 25%. To try to control price rises and attract funds, Argentina's central bank raised its interest rate to 38%.Amid rampant inflation and a lack of faith in the peso, Argentinian consumers and firms sought security in holding US dollars. Combined with rising demand from Argentina's government – which needed US dollars to make debt payments and pay for energy imports – this resulted in a shortage of US dollars in Argentina. To address this problem, former President Kirchner largely banned the sale of US dollars in 2011 but this led to the creation of a currency black market.The ban failed to contain inflation, which was among the world's highest throughout President Kirchner's term of office. Firms, meanwhile, struggled to obtain US dollars to buy parts and equipment, stifling growth and sometimes causing critical shortages at places like hospitals, which depend on imported supplies and equipment.Source: Wall Street Journal, 16 December 2015

Whether the rise in the interest rate will curb inflation depends upon whether the components of aggregate demand are sensitive to the higher interest rate.This is an aspect of contractionary monetary policy.Whether funds will be attracted depends upon whether the fears of international investors are allayed. It also depends upon the difference between the Argentine rate and rates in other countries.

The disadvantage is that trade deficits are not removed automatically.They have to be dealt with by government policy and this may be at the cost of other policy objectives. A freely floating rate has the advantage of a self-adjusting mechanism,but it also has disadvantages.

All the economies in Table 1.1 experiencecontinuous inflation over the period but the ratesdiffer, with China's rate being the lowest.Inflation can be caused for example by anincrease in aggregate demand not matched byan increase in aggregate supply or a fall in aggregate supply greater than the fall inaggregate demand.Aggregate Supply reasons include the effects ofa currency depreciation leading to rising importprices, a fall in supply of essential raw materialsand above inflation wage increases.Aggregate Demand reasons include any causesof an increase in AD such as falling interest ratesthat stimulate consumption and investmentexpenditure, increases in government spendingor a rise in net exports.For full marks the answer must be framed in thecontext of differing rates of inflation in theeconomies shown.

In 2011, 33.5% of the population lived in extreme poverty.The economy has experienced strong and broad-based growth over the past decade, averaging 10.8% per year between 2003 and 2015 compared to the regional average of 5.4% per year.Private consumption and public investment have been the main drivers of aggregate demand in recent years.In 2017, the government was implementing the second phase of its Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II), due to run from 2015 to 2020. Its aim was to continue improvements in physical infrastructure through public investment, transforming the country into a manufacturing hub. The goal was to reduce poverty in Ethiopia by 2025.Developments in the balance of payments in Ethiopia have been largely driven by the implementation of major infrastructure projects in the country that contributed to higher current account deficits, balanced by growing foreign direct investment (FDI) and long-term foreign borrowings.Source: World Bank, April 2017Extract 2: Ethiopia plans US$90 million infrastructure spending spreeDespite Ethiopia being a landlocked country, the vast majority of its imports and exports are conveyed by sea. The ports in neighbouring country Djibouti are crucial to Ethiopia because they are used for 90% of its trade.In January 2017, a US$4 billion railway project was officially completed linking Ethiopia’s capital,Addis Ababa, to the main port in Djibouti, cutting the travel time along the route from three days to just 12 hours. It was expected to cut the cost of transporting freight by a third, having a huge impact on trade flow and the lives of Ethiopians.The project was partially built and funded by Chinese companies with the assistance of the Chinese government. China Railway Group and the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation built the railway line, while China loaned Ethiopia US$2.49 billion to build the new railway. Contracts were awarded to Chinese firms to build various sections of the railway. Chinese investment in Ethiopia's infrastructure provides opportunities for Chinese steel and construction industries.China has an overcapacity in steel and needs to find markets for its excess supply.

It is essential however that the candidate makes reference to at least one item from each category to score both marks.
2
The current account balance and the trade balance differ because of primary and secondary income balances.The primary balance refers to the balance of profits, interest and dividends.The secondary balance mainly refers to the balance of current transfer payments. The candidate should show knowledge of both categories, so if only profits,interest and dividends is referred to with no reference to components of the secondary income balance, this only gains 1 mark.If the candidate uses the terms 'primary income balance'and 'secondary income balance', but is clearly confused on what these mean, e.g. reference to capital flows, then 1 mark maximum.

Explain one possible impact on Ethiopia's balance of trade in goods and services of operating the new railway line to Djibouti.For an explanation that the cost of exporting and/or importing goods should fall (1 mark) and that this• could have a 'positive' effect on the balance of trade in goods and services if the new railway line results in exports becominggreater than imports (1 mark)OR• could have a 'negative' effect on the balance of trade in goodsand services if the new railway line results in exports becoming less than imports (1 mark)OR• could have no effect on the balance of trade in goods if the newrailway line results in exports becoming equal to the imports(1 mark)
2
It is clear from the data that both the cost oftransporting freight, and the time it takes to reach the port, will be significantly reduced. Cutting the travel time/cost should lead to an increased volume of international trade.Although the mark scheme states that candidates should explain that the 'cost' of exporting goods has fallen, accept alternatives such as, 'time','convenience', 'ease'.The impact upon the balance of trade can only be assessed after consideration of the impact upon both import expenditure and export expenditure.Candidates who only consider the effect upon imports or exports have not fully assessed the overall impact upon the balance of trade in goods and services and will not gain both marks.

Identify two ways in which China's economy would benefit fromthe building of infrastructure in Ethiopia.For identification of any two benefits e.g.• inflow of profits to China• reduction in unemployment(2 @ 1 mark)
2
It is essential that the benefits identified relate to China's economy. An inflow of profits for example will benefit China's balance of payments. There will also be more employment, higher incomes, the reduction of excess capacity in the steel industry and so on. Identification without explanation can gain both marks, however there may be a need to be clear why the identified point is beneficial, e.g. a candidate might state that China's currency might appreciate. This might be a benefit but might also be a disadvantage. If there is doubt that the effect is beneficial it needs to be clarified.

Use a production possibility curve to explain the opportunitycost that Ethiopia would face if it did not have access to helpfrom China in building new infrastructure.For an accurate PPC with appropriate choices on the axes (1 mark);that demonstrates the opportunity cost of choosing infrastructure orconsumption/living standards (1 mark).For a clear explanation of the opportunity cost of using internalresources rather than Chinese funds in terms of the sacrifice of livingstandards that would be required (up to 2 marks).If the candidate is discussing incorrect choices in the diagram andthe resulting explanation but it is clear that they are correctlydemonstrating an accurate understanding of what opportunity costmeans (i.e. the cost of giving up the next best alternative) either onthe diagram or in the resulting explanation then the response may begiven a maximum mark of 1 only.
4
The context of the text makes it clear that a large number of the Ethiopian population are living in 'extreme poverty'. This means that the infrastructure without external help could only be developed through sacrifice of current living standards. The production possibility curve would show infrastructure or an example of infrastructure e.g.railways (accept capital goods) and consumer goods on the axes. The accompanying explanation should refer to the choice between developing the infrastructure and the opportunity cost of a reduction in consumption if Chinese funds are not available.A candidate may explain that not investing ininfrastructure will incur a cost in terms of lostproduction. This is represented by a shift to the left of the PPC. This is incorrect because this does not accurately describe opportunity cost in terms of the sacrifice entailed in choosing between infrastructure and consumer goods. This approach could still score one mark for an accurate diagram.

The effect of the improved infrastructure will increase both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The impact upon output, employment and prices depends upon where the curves intersect and whether there is unused capacity in the economy. Candidates need to recognise this when explaining the impact upon each economic indicator.Accept answers that suggest that the spending on the new railway can increase as a result of more consumption expenditure as more are employed to build the new infrastructure, or increased investmentas businesses are encouraged to invest more as the expectation of profits increase, or increased net exports as the new railway results in more exports.However, do not reward answers that argue that consumption will increase as a result of lowered prices due to improved efficiency/lowered costs oftransport, etc. as this would not lead to a shift in AD merely a movement along the curve.Candidates should be credited for effective use of appropriate diagrams; however, the question does not ask for a diagram so full marks are available even if no diagram is provided. For full marks, the impact on output, employment and prices must bediscussed.

1085,"The impact of demonetisation in India
India has a vast informal economy, where products and labour are exchanged for cash without official records, so that the authorities cannot easily trace the transactions. In November 2016, this informal economy was affected by a government decision to adopt a policy of 'demonetisation'.This involved the withdrawal from circulation of India's two most used bank notes, the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. This policy removed 14 trillion rupees of cash from the most cash-dependent major economy in the world. There were long queues outside banks as people tried to open bank accounts to deposit these notes before they were no longer valid.The policy was intended to remove cash hoarded by the very rich elite, criminals and the large number of people who did not pay tax.The government later said that demonetisation was also the first step in a 'cashless' revolution to move the billions of transactions undertaken each day in India through the banking system so that the tax authorities could trace them. In 2016, only 1% of workers paid income tax.
India's Labour Minister announced that it would become compulsory for employers to pay their employees through bank accounts, a hugely ambitious step in a country where as many as 90% of workers were paid in cash. Many business owners were dreading the prospect of paying their employees through bank accounts. One factory owner in Delhi commented: “How do you think I can pay the workers with a cheque if they don't have a bank account? It takes three days to clear a cheque. What will they eat during those days?”
The Indian government's vision of a cashless economy does not seem to correspond to the reality of working life in India. Another factory owner stated that this would affect the production process:“Rickshaw pullers transfer goods from my factory to the shops. For one trip I pay a rickshaw puller 100 rupees. Does the government expect me to give them a cheque for such a small amount?How do I pay them if I am not allowed to use cash? If I have to write a cheque for every payment this will increase my costs considerably.""The workers are also concerned about the change to the law that will force them to have their wages paid directly into banks. Money performs a number of important functions in an economy and cash has an acceptability that still matters for many workers. One worker commented: “I am a daily wage worker and I am not sure if I will have a job tomorrow. If I receive cash in hand, I know I have the money"".If demonetisation is to succeed, the Indian government will need to introduce incentives to persuade millions of people to open bank accounts. However, this will not be easy to achieve because around 30% of people in India still do not have bank accounts.Fig. 1.1 shows India's money supply as measured by M1, which consists of notes and coins in circulation and balances in bank deposits that can be spent immediately e.g. through withdrawals,cheques or debit cards.Source: Adapted from The Guardian, 21 December 2016

Quantities of cash can be held over a period of time and stores value by transferring purchasing power from the present to the future.The function of money as a store of value is likely to reduce at first, given that the two most used notes were withdrawn from circulation, but over time it will have less of an effect.The store of value depends upon the banknotes retaining their real worth.The short-notice removal of large denomination banknotes will have reduced peoples' confidence in holding them as a store of value since they may lose value almost instantly if not cashed in within the deadline.Smaller banknotes would be unlikely to be withdrawn so could continue as a store of value.However, these would be much less convenient (too bulky and harder to store) so would not be a perfect substitute.This use of banknotes as a store of value is liable to decline, although in the long-run people may forget or downgrade the risk.

Another factory owner stated that this would affect the production process:“Rickshaw pullers transfer goods from my factory to the shops. For one trip I pay a rickshaw puller 100 rupees. Does the government expect me to give them a cheque for such a small amount?How do I pay them if I am not allowed to use cash? If I have to write a cheque for every payment this will increase my costs considerably.""The workers are also concerned about the change to the law that will force them to have their wages paid directly into banks. Money performs a number of important functions in an economy and cash has an acceptability that still matters for many workers. One worker commented: “I am a daily wage worker and I am not sure if I will have a job tomorrow. If I receive cash in hand, I know I have the money"".If demonetisation is to succeed, the Indian government will need to introduce incentives to persuade millions of people to open bank accounts. However, this will not be easy to achieve because around 30% of people in India still do not have bank accounts.Fig. 1.1 shows India's money supply as measured by M1, which consists of notes and coins in circulation and balances in bank deposits that can be spent immediately e.g. through withdrawals,cheques or debit cards.Source: Adapted from The Guardian, 21 December 2016

It could be inflationary if the government's increased tax revenue is used to stimulate aggregate demand in the Indian economy, but it depends on whether the government spends the tax revenue.However, if the wages of employees are paid directly into bank accounts, it may reduce the extent of liquidity in the economy, reducing any inflationary threat. Also, if some people are more fearful of the future of the economy, they may be more cautious in their spending patterns, again dampening down inflation.Credit reference to Quantity Theory of Money (although not on AS syllabus): the immediate impact is that the money supply goes down,when it will not be inflationary, but there will be an eventual increase in the money supply as people open bank accounts (as shown in Fig.1.1), which could be inflationary.

1091,"The air transport market in IndiaOver the past 20 years or so, global air transport markets have become more competitive. This is especially the case in the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and, most recently,in Asia. Governments have sought to provide opportunities for new firms, invariably 'low-cost carriers' (budget airlines), to open new routes and compete with established airline operators, often in domestic markets.The situation in India is typical but only to a certain extent. The country has two established airline operators with extensive international as well as domestic service networks. They now face increasing competition from a number of low-cost carriers who operate services within India.Consumers have benefitted from these changes. As well as opening new routes, the increased competition has seen all airline operators offering cheaper prices. At the same time, the established airline operators have had to reduce costs to remain competitive. Also, demand has increased for leisure travel as well as business travel.The Indian air transport market still has some restrictions imposed by the Indian government. An important restriction is the '5/20 rule'. This stipulates that Indian-owned airline operators must have a minimum number of aircraft (20) and have been in business for a minimum of 5 years, before they can operate international services.Opponents to the 5/20 rule argue that it seriously discriminates against Indian airline operators by not allowing them to compete in a free market. They further claim that applying the rule is having a negative impact on the Indian economy.

The 5/20 restriction limits the supply of Indian airlines operating services outside the country. It protects the business interests of established carriers like Air India and Jet and the viability of the hub airports from which they operate. Fares are kept higher than if there were more competitors. The potential advantages of removing the 5/20 restriction are that it would open up the market, see new services and lower fares. It would not discriminate against Indian airlines relative to those that are foreign owned.The potential costs are that safety might be compromised as non-established firms enter the market, the greater competition might result in some established firms decreasing in size and losing the benefits of scale as a result, new entrants might bring poorer quality of services and so on, employee terms and conditions of services might decline.The wider effects on the Indian economy are less certain. There could be an improvement in the trade in services as Indian airlines generate foreign currency from fares; there could be a wider benefit as there are more opportunities for business travellers and tourists to visit India.

1096,"European Union (EU) to boost protection of steel industry as imports flood inThe EU is expected to strengthen its protection against steel imports, possibly as early as October 2016, as a global trade war in steel intensifies and steel imports keep flooding into the EU.The EU has strengthened trade defences over the past year, imposing anti-dumping tariffs on a range of steel products. These tariffs range from 18% to 25% for imports of steel from China. It is expected that these duties will be increased in October. EU data shows that 27% of steel imports come from China. The EU now has 37 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place for steelproducts, 15 of them against China.China, which produces half of the world's 1.6 billion tonnes of steel, has struggled to reduce its estimated 300 million tonnes of overcapacity, but the Chinese government denies its firms are dumping by selling steel at below the cost of production. It says global steel overcapacity is due to the collapse of demand after the 2008 financial crisis. Countries from Asia to the Americas disagree with China. The United States (US) claims that the Chinese government is subsidising its steel industry and that this is a form of protectionism that gives Chinese steelmakers an unfair advantage in world markets. It has imposed tariffs of up to 450% on some types of Chinese steel.India has also imposed tariffs on steel imports from a number of countries including China, Japan,Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea.Source: EurActiv.com with Reuters, August 2016Table 1.1: EU exports and imports of goods to and from China 2010–2015(billions of euros)

It is clear that those employed in China'ssteel mills will lose and the steel makingfirms will also make less profit. In addition,the Chinese government will lose as thereare costs in removing steel makingcapacity. It is also acceptable to refer tothe impact on those who live in steelmaking regions. Some candidates mayrefer to multiplier effects. This is acceptable, but not essential for both marks.

1101,"European Union (EU) to boost protection of steel industry as imports flood inThe EU is expected to strengthen its protection against steel imports, possibly as early as October 2016, as a global trade war in steel intensifies and steel imports keep flooding into the EU.The EU has strengthened trade defences over the past year, imposing anti-dumping tariffs on a range of steel products. These tariffs range from 18% to 25% for imports of steel from China. It is expected that these duties will be increased in October. EU data shows that 27% of steel imports come from China. The EU now has 37 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place for steelproducts, 15 of them against China.China, which produces half of the world's 1.6 billion tonnes of steel, has struggled to reduce its estimated 300 million tonnes of overcapacity, but the Chinese government denies its firms are dumping by selling steel at below the cost of production. It says global steel overcapacity is due to the collapse of demand after the 2008 financial crisis. Countries from Asia to the Americas disagree with China. The United States (US) claims that the Chinese government is subsidising its steel industry and that this is a form of protectionism that gives Chinese steelmakers an unfair advantage in world markets. It has imposed tariffs of up to 450% on some types of Chinese steel.India has also imposed tariffs on steel imports from a number of countries including China, Japan,Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea.Source: EurActiv.com with Reuters, August 2016Table 1.1: EU exports and imports of goods to and from China 2010–2015(billions of euros)

","With reference to the principle of comparative advantage, discuss whether the increase in exports of EU services to China could justify free trade in the market for steel. [6]","e

The rise in sales of services to China couldbe application of the principle of comparative advantage and it could be argued that the EU should specialise in services and China in steel. If the size of China's exports of steel to the EU has resulted from dumping, however, this does not suggest lower opportunity costs in steel making in China. There are also strategic reasons for maintaining steel making in the EU.

Source: MIAC, JMAJapan's economy shrunk by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2015. This was as a result of weak domestic consumption and slow exports. Should the economy continue to contract for another quarter and inflation expectations start to fall, expansionary monetary policy is likely to be introduced.Private consumption, which accounts for about 60% of Japan’s national income, fell 0.8%, partly because of weak overall wage growth and partly because of bad weather. Household spending has struggled to recover following a sales tax rise last year, which was part of the government’s aim to push up prices to achieve its 2% inflation target. Despite wage rises at some big firms and labour shortages, it has been a struggle to convince people to spend much more money on consumer goods after last year’s sales tax rise. Increasing consumption is proving even more difficult given falling oil prices. Exports dropped 4.4% in the same quarter. The sharp plunge was partly due to disappointing demand for Japanese products, especially in the US and China. The slowdown in China, a major market for Japanese exporters, has further raised concerns.It is now two years since Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, introduced his policy, sometimes called 'Abenomics'.

The programme called for more government spending, large increases in the money supply and reforms to a highly regulated economy. But the pace of reforms has been slow, particularly in the protected agricultural sector.

Both have oil as components and'tumbling oil prices' have reduced both categories of spending and contributed to downward pressure on prices.

","With reference to the year on year price changes shown in Table 2, explain which category of spending had the greatest impact on the real income of the average household in Japan in 2015. [4]","c
For identifying 'Food'as the category that has the greatest impact upon real incomes (1 mark) because this category has the highest weight attached (1 mark) and together with the price change (1 mark) will lead to a decrease real incomes (1 mark) (4 maximum)Allow credit for the argument that 'Fuel, Light and Water' shows the biggest fall in price (1 mark) and that this will increase real incomes (1 mark).(2 maximum)
4
'Real income' is money income adjusted for price changes. It expresses how many goods and services that a given money income can buy. The impact of price changes on real income is determined by two factors.One isthe year on year price change and the other is the weight attached to each category of spending.In terms of the data, ""Fuel etc'hasthe greatest price change, but its weight is much less than 'Food'. 'Food' has the highest year on year price increase and it also has thehighest weight attached. When the extent of the price change and the weight attached to the categories of spending are examined it isclear that food price changes have the greatest impact upon real incomes. In order to score full marks it is necessary to provide a full explanation of the reason that this category of spending has the highest impact upon real incomes.

6
Expansionary monetary policy is action taken to increase the money supply, reduce the rate of interest or improve access to credit facilities.It is intended to increase consumption and investment expenditure. In addition,it will lead to a fall in an economy's exchange rate, which will increase net exports. Whether an expansionary monetary policy will cause inflation depends firstly upon how sensitive each category of spending is to the change in monetary aggregates and secondly whether the increased spending can be matched by an increase in aggregate supply. This depends upon the relationship between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. In terms of Japan, whether prices will increase depends upon factors referred to in the data. E.g. weak wage growth, bad weather and low confidence amongst consumers.

",Discuss whether all individuals and firms in Japan would benefit from a rise in the rate of inflation. [6],"e
For explaining who would lose from a higher rate of inflation(Up to 4 marks)For explaining who would gain from a higher rate of inflation(Up to 4 marks)A list of those who would lose (1 max) and those who would gain (1 max) 2 maximum.(5 marks maximum)Reserve 1 mark for a conclusion
6
Some would gain and some would lose from a rise in the rate of inflation. For example, those on fixed incomes would lose as would creditors if the rate of interest charged was below the rate of inflation. Businesses would suffer menu costs and consumers would face shoe-leather costs. Exporters would lose competitiveness if the higher rate of inflation exceeds that of competitors in overseas markets. Domestic producers would lose if the higher rate of inflation resulted in a rise in cheaper imports.Those who would gain might include those who are in strong trade unions, creditors, and producers who would enjoy increased profits as prices rise. So from this perspective some would gain and some would lose from a rise in inflation in the Japanese economy. Some might argue however that all would benefit from a healthier Japanese economy with a higher, but still manageable rate of inflation.


"
1108,"Well-being and economic growth
For many years governments have sought to deal with economic performance with policies and tools based on the assumption that consumers would act rationally in response to incentives or sanctions. They have also operated public sector services assuming that the best outcome is achieved through the power of government to regulate, tax and spend.  
The tools the government uses are designed to influence consumer demand, often with the aim of increasing economic growth and GDP. But economic growth does not guarantee rising prosperity and well-being, as illustrated by Table 1.1 that compares HDI and GDP of selected countries. 
Ideally, all major investment projects in the public sector should require a cost-benefit analysis. This assesses the wider effects of projects. The project may have different effects on a poorer group than on a wealthy group. For example, a poorer group may gain considerably more benefit, or well-being, from a government grant than a richer group.
Some economies have tried to influence economic growth by using an expansionary monetary policy. In some countries this has meant that bank interest rates have been kept very low. It was hoped that this would encourage investment and borrowing and increase spending. Recently there has been some pressure to raise interest rates. But raising interest rates is not always wise. 
Higher interest rates could be justified in an economy experiencing economic growth, falling unemployment and an increase in business investment with the result that there are fewer unused resources in the economy. 
Against that, higher interest rates could decrease consumer spending and also result in a decrease in investment. This may mean no increase in real wages. It could suggest interest rates should stay low.

1110,"Well-being and economic growth
For many years governments have sought to deal with economic performance with policies and tools based on the assumption that consumers would act rationally in response to incentives or sanctions. They have also operated public sector services assuming that the best outcome is achieved through the power of government to regulate, tax and spend.  
The tools the government uses are designed to influence consumer demand, often with the aim of increasing economic growth and GDP. But economic growth does not guarantee rising prosperity and well-being, as illustrated by Table 1.1 that compares HDI and GDP of selected countries. 
Ideally, all major investment projects in the public sector should require a cost-benefit analysis. This assesses the wider effects of projects. The project may have different effects on a poorer group than on a wealthy group. For example, a poorer group may gain considerably more benefit, or well-being, from a government grant than a richer group.
Some economies have tried to influence economic growth by using an expansionary monetary policy. In some countries this has meant that bank interest rates have been kept very low. It was hoped that this would encourage investment and borrowing and increase spending. Recently there has been some pressure to raise interest rates. But raising interest rates is not always wise. 
Higher interest rates could be justified in an economy experiencing economic growth, falling unemployment and an increase in business investment with the result that there are fewer unused resources in the economy. 
Against that, higher interest rates could decrease consumer spending and also result in a decrease in investment. This may mean no increase in real wages. It could suggest interest rates should stay low.

1112,"Trade war breaks out between the United States (US) and China

Fig 1.1: Components of the US current account, Q1 2010 to Q1 2018 

Fig. 1.2: Chinese yuan to US dollar rate of exchange, August 2017 to July 2018 
Extract 1: The US government says, ‘We are confronting China’s unfair trade policies’ 
For many years, China has pursued industrial policies and unfair trade practices – including dumping, discriminatory non-tariff barriers and industrial subsidies – that favour Chinese firms and make it impossible for many US firms to compete. China imposes much higher tariffs on US exports than the US imposes on China. China’s average tariff rate is nearly three times higher than the average US rate. Certain products are even more imbalanced, for instance the US charges a 2.5% tariff on Chinese cars, while China currently maintains a 25% tariff on cars from the US. China has banned imports of some US agricultural products, excluding US farmers from a major market for their goods. China has dumped and unfairly subsidised a range of goods for the US market, undermining US domestic firms. In 2018 alone, the US government has found dumping or unfair subsidies on 13 different products.
Source: The White House, US government, 29 May 2018
Extract 2: Winners and losers in the US–China trade war
The US government imposed a first round of tariffs on Chinese goods on 6 July 2018, by introducing 25% taxes on US$34 billion of Chinese imports. These were a response to China’s“unfair trade policies” – the US claimed China was selling Chinese products in the US below their normal price, called ‘dumping’, as well as subsidising the production of goods exported to the US. It was then announced that tariffs on a further US$50 billion worth of imports from China would come into effect. The US threats have risen since, with the president saying he is ready to impose tariffs on all US$500 billion of Chinese imports.
China has retaliated, saying it will levy new tariffs on more than 5200 US products, if the US government proceeds with its latest tariff threat. The duties would range from 5% to 25% on US$60 billion worth of US products imported into China, including further agricultural products such as soya beans.
The US government imposed tariffs because they said that the “unfair trade practices” have resulted in a US trade deficit with China, but this makes no sense. The trade deficit is an inevitable by-product of a robust US economy, a large US fiscal deficit and a strong US dollar. If correcting the US trade deficit is the government’s policy aim then it should raise US taxes to reduce the fiscal deficit and the US central bank should act to lower the value of the US dollar against China’s currency, the yuan.
Both countries will lose in a major trade war, but the losses will differ in kind and amount. It could cut China’s exports to the US by about a third, some US$200 billion annually. Eventually, Chinese firms will find new markets and create new products to compensate. For a period of two or three years, however, the disruption to workers and firms will be enormous. As many as 4 million Chinese workers could become unemployed, and many Chinese firms will go out of business. 
If US exports to China are cut by a third in a major trade war, the US will lose about US$50 billion of exports annually. About 250000 US workers will lose their jobs. If US firms can see no end to the trade war, they will reorganise and locate production in lower-cost countries like Vietnam and Peru. The Chinese government, however, will strongly encourage Chinese firms to produce many of their goods at home, even though the cost will be much higher.

The most likely response from candidates is the price elasticity of demand for imports and exports (M-L condition: but this must be explained perhaps with reference to the J-curve).

A ‘robust US economy’ suggests higher employment in the US and higher incomes leading to increased US demand for imports (and/or the diversion of exports to the home market). May get some reference to income elasticity of demand for imports.A‘large US fiscal deficit’suggests that there has been an increase in G and/or a fall in T raising aggregate demand that will lead to increased spending on imports. Possible increased spending by US government on Chinese goods.A‘strong US dollar’will lead to a rise in the price of US exports and a fall in the price of imports.

If correcting the US trade deficit is the government’s policy aim then it should raise US taxes to reduce the fiscal deficit and the US central bank should act to lower the value of the US dollar against China’s currency, the yuan.
Both countries will lose in a major trade war, but the losses will differ in kind and amount. It could cut China’s exports to the US by about a third, some US$200 billion annually. Eventually, Chinese firms will find new markets and create new products to compensate. For a period of two or three years, however, the disruption to workers and firms will be enormous. As many as 4 million Chinese workers could become unemployed, and many Chinese firms will go out of business. 
If US exports to China are cut by a third in a major trade war, the US will lose about US$50 billion of exports annually. About 250000 US workers will lose their jobs. If US firms can see no end to the trade war, they will reorganise and locate production in lower-cost countries like Vietnam and Peru. The Chinese government, however, will strongly encourage Chinese firms to produce many of their goods at home, even though the cost will be much higher.

The relevant economic theory is the principle of comparative advantage. The trade war undermines this and confirms the idea that ‘both countries will lose in a trade war’. Some industries might benefit, but consumers will lose and some might be left unemployed as their industries are denied access to China’s market. Some might argue that if China is indeed engaged in unfair trade practices, the actions of the US government might force them to stop these and free trade could emerge and in this sense the US could enjoy overall benefit.

1118,"Downturn in the growth of the world’s leading economies
In February 2016 there were dramatic changes in both financial and commodity markets across the world. Central bank interest rates in some countries were at their lowest recorded level, prices of banking shares fell heavily and oil prices in New York fell to US$26.34 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.
Economists warned that the falls in share prices could indicate a downturn for economies with a possible collapse of banks, as happened in the financial crash of 2008. A healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth. Very low interest rates undermine the profitability of commercial banks.
Overproduction of oil by Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel OPEC, created price falls and deficits in the budgets of its OPEC partners that resulted in contractions in the economies of oilexporting countries. On the other hand, oil importing countries benefited from lower production costs although their governments claimed that revenues from sales taxes on oil products fell.
Also in 2016, China’s demand for oil fell because of a downturn in its economy. In 2010 China’s economy grew by 10%. By 2015 the rate had fallen to 6.9%. Some critics said that China’s high economic growth was enabled by the excessive borrowing of the central government to build massive infrastructure projects – such as roads, offices and factories. This meant that the government owed huge amounts to banks driving them towards bankruptcy. These debts were linked to excess capacity in the construction and manufacturing industries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern at the state of the global economy in 2016. It criticised the over-reliance by some of the world’s major economies on monetary policies based on low interest rates and quantitative easing. It argued that monetary policy cannot work alone to boost an economy and that fiscal expansion was needed to increase aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By 2016, many economies had reduced government spending and aimed at cutting budget deficits. As a result the OECD reduced its GDP growth forecasts in 2016. For example, the world average forecast growth rate was cut from 3.3% to 3.0%.

 ",What is meant by ‘quantitative easing’?    [3],"1(a)
The central bank creates money through its open-market operations. It involves the purchase of bonds with cash which increases the stock of money held by banks and financial institutions. This would have an effect on interest rate and increases the potential for lending in the economy.

 ",Explain why ‘a healthy banking system is needed to promote economic growth’.    [4],"1(b)
Central bank controls credit creation and hence money supply to controlinflation.Commercial banks create credit to finance consumption and investment by households and enterprises and thus provide liquidity in an economy. If bank customers lose faith in the banking system there could be a run on the banks leading to collapse in banking services.

 ",Explain what caused the fall in the price of oil and analyse whether the evidence in the article indicates that the only cause of the economic downturn in various economies was the fall in the price of oil.     [6],"1(c)

Cause of oil price fall – increased oil supplies (Saudi Arabia/OPEC cartel)                                   – declining demand (China)                                                         (up to 2 marks)
Direct effects on oil producing economies – lower export revenues and budget deficits – reverse multiplier effects. Could lead to economic downturn.Oil importing countries benefit from lower production costs but loss of revenue from taxes on oil products can lead to budget deficits also.                                                                      (up to 2 marks)
However China’s downturn has been caused by over-investment on infrastructure based on excessive borrowing rather than by the fall in the price of oil. Article says reduced government spending and government fiscal policy also could cause economic downturn.           (up to 2 marks)

1122,"Poland: a growing economy
Extract 1: Poland’s successful transition from a planned economy
Since 1995, Poland has grown faster than all other large economies at a similar level of development. By 2015, Poland’s national income had reached a record level. Consumption expenditure rose and exports dramatically increased, coming close to US$250 billion in 2013. 
Poland’s growth has been based on skilled labour and entrepreneurship, not on natural resources. Two crucial factors were important in Poland’s development. Firstly, Poland adopted a policy of expanding the quantity and quality of education. In 2015, 50% of young people studied at university level, up from 10% in 1989. Secondly, the Polish government used funds from the European Union (EU) to develop transport links that helped to connect Poland with Western Europe.
Poland seems to have been thorough in introducing market-oriented reforms at the beginning of its transition from a planned economy in the 1990s. This helped to create a private sector boom and ensured Poland avoided a post-transition recession. It managed the privatisation process in an efficient way. Lastly, Poland benefited from a large and rapidly growing domestic market, which helped to insulate it from external shocks, such as the global financial crisis in 2007–08. 
Poland’s performance in the last 25 years could be called a miracle.
Source: Marcin Piatkowski: Brookings Institution, February 2015
Extract 2: Will Poland’s economy slow down?
The Polish economy’s growth slowed significantly in 2016, mainly due to a slowdown in private investment. The outlook for 2017 was also gloomy, with concerns regarding the global economy and domestic economic policy. Private consumption and public investment were expected to continue to be strong, but a significant slowdown in economic activity was expected throughout the year.
This was because of a significant decline in investment by private companies. In the first half of 2016 companies were cutting spending on fixed capital. A survey by the Polish central bank indicated that companies were very reluctant to start new investments. Entrepreneurs were afraid of the possible consequences of changes in the government’s economic policy, for example increased indirect taxes such as general sales taxes. In addition, foreign companies were delaying major investments in Poland because of the uncertainties in the economic climate.
After a period of rising net exports of goods, by 2016 the trend was reversing mainly due to a decline in demand from the larger EU economies. The outlook for 2017 was not any better and the fall in net exports of goods was expected to be the main factor slowing down the Polish economy.
Public spending was one possible way in which Poland’s economic growth could have been boosted in 2017. The government could increase the budget deficit and take other demandstimulating actions. An interesting suggestion from the government was to decrease the retirement age back to its 2012 level (65 years for men and 60 years for women). All of these proposals might keep GDP growth above 3% until the end of the year.

1124,"Poland: a growing economy
Extract 1: Poland’s successful transition from a planned economy
Since 1995, Poland has grown faster than all other large economies at a similar level of development. By 2015, Poland’s national income had reached a record level. Consumption expenditure rose and exports dramatically increased, coming close to US$250 billion in 2013. 
Poland’s growth has been based on skilled labour and entrepreneurship, not on natural resources. Two crucial factors were important in Poland’s development. Firstly, Poland adopted a policy of expanding the quantity and quality of education. In 2015, 50% of young people studied at university level, up from 10% in 1989. Secondly, the Polish government used funds from the European Union (EU) to develop transport links that helped to connect Poland with Western Europe.
Poland seems to have been thorough in introducing market-oriented reforms at the beginning of its transition from a planned economy in the 1990s. This helped to create a private sector boom and ensured Poland avoided a post-transition recession. It managed the privatisation process in an efficient way. Lastly, Poland benefited from a large and rapidly growing domestic market, which helped to insulate it from external shocks, such as the global financial crisis in 2007–08. 
Poland’s performance in the last 25 years could be called a miracle.

Extract 2: Will Poland’s economy slow down?
The Polish economy’s growth slowed significantly in 2016, mainly due to a slowdown in private investment. The outlook for 2017 was also gloomy, with concerns regarding the global economy and domestic economic policy. Private consumption and public investment were expected to continue to be strong, but a significant slowdown in economic activity was expected throughout the year.
This was because of a significant decline in investment by private companies. In the first half of 2016 companies were cutting spending on fixed capital. A survey by the Polish central bank indicated that companies were very reluctant to start new investments. Entrepreneurs were afraid of the possible consequences of changes in the government’s economic policy, for example increased indirect taxes such as general sales taxes. In addition, foreign companies were delaying major investments in Poland because of the uncertainties in the economic climate.
After a period of rising net exports of goods, by 2016 the trend was reversing mainly due to a decline in demand from the larger EU economies. The outlook for 2017 was not any better and the fall in net exports of goods was expected to be the main factor slowing down the Polish economy.
Public spending was one possible way in which Poland’s economic growth could have been boosted in 2017. The government could increase the budget deficit and take other demandstimulating actions. An interesting suggestion from the government was to decrease the retirement age back to its 2012 level (65 years for men and 60 years for women). All of these proposals might keep GDP growth above 3% until the end of the year.

Candidates need to use the data in the table tocalculate the deficit and that this is declining. It is essential that the correct term, ‘deficit’ be used. If the candidate states that the deficit is improving then allow 1 mark for deficit, but the second mark should only be awarded if it is clear that the candidate also understands that the deficit is going down. If for example the candidate uses the term deficit and then illustrates that the deficit has gone down in figures then this can be awarded 2 marks.

Supply-side policies include any policies that aim to increase the aggregate supply. Any examples of policies that aim to achieve this should be credited.
The examples might include the policy of expanding the quality and quantity of education, the use of EU funds to develop transport links, privatisation and marketoriented reforms.

The most appropriate diagram is one that shows a shift in the supply curve to the left, with a rise in price and fall in quantity. This shows that entrepreneurs will face a rise in price and a fall in sales and a likely fall in profits.
Shifts in the aggregate supply curve are not acceptable.

A candidate may recognise that the factors mentioned are likely to depress aggregate demand, but may go on to explain that whether aggregate demand actually falls depends upon other factors. Extract 2 suggests that the government might take action to offset the fall and overall this might cause aggregate demand to rise. This approach could still be awarded full marks as long as it is wellargued and there is a clear explanation of the link between the action taken and aggregate demand.

There are a number of indications in Extract 2 to suggest that the Polish economy will slow down. For example, net exports and private investment are expected to fall. This leads to the view that ‘the outlook was gloomy’ and ‘there will be a significant slowdown in economic activity’. These changes must be linked to the predicted fall in aggregate demand.
Candidates may take the view that whether aggregate demand will actually fall depends upon the extent to which any government action to increase aggregate demand such as increased public spending or ‘other demand stimulating actions’ overcome those factorsthat are depressing aggregate demand.

1128,"Poland: a growing economy
Extract 1: Poland’s successful transition from a planned economy
Since 1995, Poland has grown faster than all other large economies at a similar level of development. By 2015, Poland’s national income had reached a record level. Consumption expenditure rose and exports dramatically increased, coming close to US$250 billion in 2013. 
Poland’s growth has been based on skilled labour and entrepreneurship, not on natural resources. Two crucial factors were important in Poland’s development. Firstly, Poland adopted a policy of expanding the quantity and quality of education. In 2015, 50% of young people studied at university level, up from 10% in 1989. Secondly, the Polish government used funds from the European Union (EU) to develop transport links that helped to connect Poland with Western Europe.
Poland seems to have been thorough in introducing market-oriented reforms at the beginning of its transition from a planned economy in the 1990s. This helped to create a private sector boom and ensured Poland avoided a post-transition recession. It managed the privatisation process in an efficient way. Lastly, Poland benefited from a large and rapidly growing domestic market, which helped to insulate it from external shocks, such as the global financial crisis in 2007–08. 
Poland’s performance in the last 25 years could be called a miracle.

Extract 2: Will Poland’s economy slow down?
The Polish economy’s growth slowed significantly in 2016, mainly due to a slowdown in private investment. The outlook for 2017 was also gloomy, with concerns regarding the global economy and domestic economic policy. Private consumption and public investment were expected to continue to be strong, but a significant slowdown in economic activity was expected throughout the year.
This was because of a significant decline in investment by private companies. In the first half of 2016 companies were cutting spending on fixed capital. A survey by the Polish central bank indicated that companies were very reluctant to start new investments. Entrepreneurs were afraid of the possible consequences of changes in the government’s economic policy, for example increased indirect taxes such as general sales taxes. In addition, foreign companies were delaying major investments in Poland because of the uncertainties in the economic climate.
After a period of rising net exports of goods, by 2016 the trend was reversing mainly due to a decline in demand from the larger EU economies. The outlook for 2017 was not any better and the fall in net exports of goods was expected to be the main factor slowing down the Polish economy.
Public spending was one possible way in which Poland’s economic growth could have been boosted in 2017. The government could increase the budget deficit and take other demandstimulating actions. An interesting suggestion from the government was to decrease the retirement age back to its 2012 level (65 years for men and 60 years for women). All of these proposals might keep GDP growth above 3% until the end of the year.

Candidates need to explain that an increasing budget deficit represents an increase in AD. This could be caused by a fall in taxes that will increase consumption, and/or a rise in government spending that has a direct effect upon AD. They need explain that this will shiftthe AD upwards and increase equilibrium national income. They then need to explain that the impact can be on prices and/or output and employment and that this depends upon the availability of unused resources. They then need to provide a conclusion on whetherthe impact will always be positive.

1129,"Problems in the steel industry
By 2016, China’s steel industry had expanded rapidly and accounted for just over half of world production but China’s economy had huge excess capacity: 30% in the case of steel which led to cheap export prices. Chinese economic growth in real terms was slowing and aggregate supply was greater than aggregate demand. Profit margins were already small but the collapse of world steel prices which fell significantly in 2015 (as shown in Fig. 1.1) worsened the situation.
The dumping of cheap Chinese imports of steel caused problems for the United Kingdom (UK) steel industry. There were thousands of job losses at three major steel factories which was devastating news for UK steel workers and the regional economies.
Some argued that despite this there was no case for the UK Government to intervene to save the steel factories.
Steel is used in the construction industry and in the production of cars, household appliances and many other goods. Companies that use steel are much more numerous than companies that produce it. If steel prices are low, the costs of companies that use steel are reduced. So there should be no complaints or pleas for government intervention about supposedly unfair competition from cut-price imports.
Industrial policy is a valid aim of government when it comes to identifying market failures. There iseven a strong case for rescuing industries that face temporary external shocks, such as occurred with the United States (US) Government’s rescue of Chrysler and General Motors in 2008 as the economy fell into deep recession. For steel, however, it is a buyers’ market. The closure of unprofitable steel factories is not a market failure at all. It is a reflection of costs being too high and the industry being uncompetitive. Rescuing steel factories with public money would do nothing to alleviate the problem of overcapacity. It would divert scarce resources from more productive uses such as long term investment in infrastructure.

",Why is the market for steel described in the article as “a buyers’ market”?   [4],"1(c)
Steel is a key material used in manufacturing. Firms that buy steel have benefited from lower world prices (45% lower in a year).Therefore production costs are lower and product prices will be more competitive.On the other hand excess world supplies will continue to outstrip demand and prices could fall further.Excess supply, buyers have more power over market.

Market failure: inefficient allocation of resources – maybe due to monopoly, information failure, externalities or need for public goods. (1–2)
The case for intervention is based on the need to preserve jobs and help sustain the local economy near steel plants. In the short run the government could subsidise production until such time as world demand increases and prices of steel rise (temporary external shocks);
The danger of foreign suppliers that undercut UK steel prices is not really a case of market failure but market forces working. Local industry costs are too high; industry uncompetitive. However, if there is ‘dumping’ then it can be a market failure.
Government may fear future increase in prices leaving UK economy vulnerable to dependence on foreign steel and wish to support home industry. This is not a case of market failure.
Also, if the steel industry is a high cost industry with overcapacity it could be unsustainable in the long run. If supported it would require public funds which would mean less spent on other projects. No real evidence for improved efficiency from this. Not really market failure.

Venezuela is suffering the worst economic crisis in its history. Ordinary people in this oil-rich country are regularly going without food. Angry, hungry mobs are queuing outside almost empty supermarkets. The government has declared a state of emergency, food is being transported under armed guard, and basic necessities are being rationed. People have to queue for hours and sometimes overnight to receive basic commodities, such as rice and cooking oil.
Venezuela has the largest known oil reserves in the world — even greater than Saudi Arabia. In the past the government used money from oil exports to fund its own expenditure and to support domestic consumption. In addition, more than 1200 private companies in a wide range of sectors, such as sugar plantations and dairy farms, were nationalised. But in 2015 the oil price fell by 50% and this resulted in a shortage of money to fund government spending. The government maintained their spending by printing money, fuelling inflation. 
As Venezuela’s currency, the bolivar, was losing value, those holding bolivars increasingly exchanged them for US dollars. As a result, a restriction was placed upon those who could legally buy US dollars and the exchange rate was fixed. Unable to buy US dollars legally, businesses turned to the black market, where the value of the US dollar soared. While the official exchange rate is 10 bolivars per US dollar, the bolivar now trades on the black market at more than 1000 bolivars per US dollar. The collapse of the currency is made worse by oil’s continuing low price — Venezuela can no longer rely on its oil exports bringing back enough US dollars, which means it can’t import enough goods, leading to shortages. 
The government tried to ration basic foodstuffs and fix their prices, but as a result it became unprofitable for Venezuelan companies to make such things, and as a consequence they have simply disappeared from the shops into other illegal markets.

As a result, a restriction was placed upon those who could legally buy US dollars and the exchange rate was fixed. Unable to buy US dollars legally, businesses turned to the black market, where the value of the US dollar soared. While the official exchange rate is 10 bolivars per US dollar, the bolivar now trades on the black market at more than 1000 bolivars per US dollar. The collapse of the currency is made worse by oil’s continuing low price — Venezuela can no longer rely on its oil exports bringing back enough US dollars, which means it can’t import enough goods, leading to shortages. 
The government tried to ration basic foodstuffs and fix their prices, but as a result it became unprofitable for Venezuelan companies to make such things, and as a consequence they have simply disappeared from the shops into other illegal markets.

The data makes it clear that there has been an increase in the money supply as the Venezuelan government printed money to maintain it’s spending. This will create demand-pull inflation. The data also makes it clear that the collapse of the bolivar has increased the costs of imported products. As a result this will create cost-pushinflation. (It may also increase demandpull inflation as exports become cheaper and X-M increases)

Venezuela is suffering the worst economic crisis in its history. Ordinary people in this oil-rich country are regularly going without food. Angry, hungry mobs are queuing outside almost empty supermarkets. The government has declared a state of emergency, food is being transported under armed guard, and basic necessities are being rationed. People have to queue for hours and sometimes overnight to receive basic commodities, such as rice and cooking oil.
Venezuela has the largest known oil reserves in the world — even greater than Saudi Arabia. In the past the government used money from oil exports to fund its own expenditure and to support domestic consumption. In addition, more than 1200 private companies in a wide range of sectors, such as sugar plantations and dairy farms, were nationalised. But in 2015 the oil price fell by 50% and this resulted in a shortage of money to fund government spending. The government maintained their spending by printing money, fuelling inflation. 
As Venezuela’s currency, the bolivar, was losing value, those holding bolivars increasingly exchanged them for US dollars. As a result, a restriction was placed upon those who could legally buy US dollars and the exchange rate was fixed.

A list of functions with no discussion of how these might be affected by inflation scores maximum 1 mark
The high and increasing rate of inflation will undermine the bolivar’s ability to perform its functions as money. Candidates need to identify the functions of money and then explain how these will be affected by the high rate of inflation. Whether they will all be affected depends upon the rate at which inflation rises. Candidates need to recognise this and there should be a concluding comment on whether all the functions of money will be affected.
