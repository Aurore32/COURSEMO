",Distinguish between limit pricing and predatory pricing. [4],"a.i

Distinguish between limit pricing and predatory pricing.
Limit Pricing is a strategy used by the existing supplier to restrict the entry of new entrants into the market. The existing firm sets a price low enough to prevent new entrants considering it a worthwhile market in which to try and compete. They set a price possibly close to average cost so that just normal profit is made. (2)
Predatory pricing by contrast is a strategy which is used by one supplier to force another supplier already in the market to leave the market. They set a price below unit cost in the short run to drive out competition. Then later raise prices to recover those losses. It is considered anti-competitive and is illegal under their anti-trust laws. (2)

","Limit pricing and predatory pricing are distinct strategies employed by firms to influence market competition. Limit pricing occurs when an established firm sets prices sufficiently low to deter potential new entrants from joining the market. This is achieved by pricing close to average cost, allowing the incumbent to earn normal profits while making the market appear unattractive due to insufficient profit margins for newcomers. By maintaining prices just above the competitive level, the firm leverages economies of scale or cost advantages to sustain this strategy without incurring losses.  

Predatory pricing, conversely, involves temporarily setting prices below production costs to force existing competitors out of the market. The dominant firm absorbs short-term losses, often financed by its financial reserves, to drive rivals into insolvency. Once competition is eliminated, the firm raises prices to recoup losses and exploit monopoly power. Unlike limit pricing, which targets potential entrants, predatory pricing directly undermines active competitors and is typically deemed illegal under antitrust laws due to its anti-competitive intent. Both strategies exploit pricing mechanisms but differ in their objectives: limit pricing aims to preempt competition, while predatory pricing seeks to eliminate it."

","The significant growth of the five largest technology companies could positively impact the macroeconomy through several channels. First, their expansion may increase employment opportunities. As these firms scale operations, they directly hire more workers in high-skilled roles, such as software development and data analysis, while indirectly stimulating job creation in ancillary sectors like logistics, digital services, and maintenance. For instance, the article highlights their “record-breaking sales and profits” (US$68 billion combined), which likely fund investments in new projects, further boosting labour demand. This reduces unemployment and raises household incomes, contributing to higher aggregate demand.  

Second, their dominance could enhance economic growth. By driving innovation in sectors such as e-commerce and cloud computing—accelerated during the pandemic as “online working and shopping” surged—these firms raise productivity across the economy. Higher productivity increases the economy’s productive capacity, shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve outward. This aligns with the article’s reference to “creative destruction,” where technological advancements replace outdated industries, fostering dynamic efficiency and sustained GDP growth.  

Third, their global operations may improve the balance of payments. As these companies export digital services and products worldwide, they generate foreign exchange earnings. For example, US-based tech giants capturing international markets reduce trade deficits, strengthening the dollar’s value and stabilising exchange rates. Additionally, their “huge cash reserves” could fund domestic infrastructure or R&D, creating multiplier effects as spending circulates through the economy. However, the extent of these benefits depends on whether profits are repatriated or reinvested locally, a nuance not detailed in the extract.  

While these effects are plausible, their magnitude may be limited by factors such as tax avoidance (mentioned in the article) and potential crowding out of smaller firms, which could stifle broader innovation. Thus, while the macroeconomic gains are evident, their sustainability and equitable distribution remain contingent on regulatory frameworks ensuring fair competition and reinvestment."

The article says the growth of large firms is bad for consumers, bad for competition, and causes inequality.
Consider whether this statement can be supported by the article or by economic theory.
In support: Article mentions profit compared with salaries, restriction on union membership, avoidance of tax, expansion into adjacent markets.
Theory: Growth of firms can lead to less choice, higher prices, restricted output, higher profits. This is supported by the article and by theory. It can be detrimental for consumers and detrimental for competition. Monopolies can be formed, small firms forced out of the market. (4 marks for support)
Against the statement: Article mentions consumers working/staying at home and welcoming the service the firms provide.
Theory: Large firms can also have economies of scale, can reduce prices, can encourage innovation and research. This is not mentioned in the article but is supported by economic theory. (4 marks for against the statement)
Conclusion: statement is not therefore always true. (1 mark)

","The assertion that the growth of large firms harms consumers, competition, and equality can be partially supported by both the article and economic theory, though nuances exist. On one hand, the article highlights how dominant technology firms, such as those earning “US$68 billion” in combined profits, exploit market power to undermine competition. For instance, their “huge cash reserves” enable predatory pricing, deterring new entrants and reducing contestability, a concept central to monopoly theory. This aligns with the economic argument that monopolies restrict output (Qm < Qc) and raise prices (Pm > Pc), causing allocative inefficiency (P > MC) and consumer harm through reduced surplus. Furthermore, the article notes attempts to “prevent workers joining a trade union,” exacerbating inequality by concentrating power and profits among shareholders rather than redistributing gains to workers. Such inequality is reinforced by the stark contrast between the “US$52,000 average American yearly salary” and the firms’ rapid profit accumulation, reflecting theories of income disparity under concentrated market structures.

The article also underscores reduced competition through political influence, as large firms leverage their size to resist “government intervention,” weakening regulatory efforts to ensure fair markets. This mirrors the theory of regulatory capture, where dominant firms distort policies to entrench their position. Additionally, tax avoidance and expansion into adjacent markets, as described in the article, exemplify monopolistic practices that stifle innovation and consumer choice, consistent with Schumpeter’s later critiques of entrenched corporate power over “creative destruction.”

However, economic theory offers counterarguments absent in the article. Large firms may achieve economies of scale, lowering average costs and prices for consumers. For example, technical economies in production or marketing could reduce consumer prices, though the article focuses only on “undercut[ting]” rivals rather than cost efficiencies. Similarly, while the article dismisses innovation by citing acquisitions over internal R&D (e.g., “giant drug companies” buying smaller firms), theory suggests large firms’ resources can fund high-risk innovation, potentially benefiting consumers. The article’s sole positive note—consumers “welcomed” online services during the pandemic—hints at such benefits but lacks depth.

Ultimately, while the article provides evidence of harm through anticompetitive practices and inequality, its neglect of potential efficiencies and innovation presents a one-sided view. Economic theory acknowledges both the risks of market dominance and the possible benefits of scale, suggesting the statement oversimplifies a complex issue. Thus, while supported by the article’s examples, the claim is not universally valid in theory."
4,"Reduced Migration to the United States (US)
The factors of production land, labour, capital and enterprise form the basis for all economic output. Whilst land is geographically fixed, the other factors of production, for example labour, are mobile. Large numbers of migrants move from country to country every year. Many migrate to the US. 
The average increase in the number of migrants working in the US was 0.6 million per year until 2018. However, the Covid-19 restrictions in place since 2019 prevented migration and by 2022 the total number of migrants working in the US was nearly 2 million lower than expected.
Half of migrants initially come as students, to be college educated, often in science-based subjects. Post-graduation, they often remain to work in the high-tech industries, before many return to their home countries with enhanced skills. 
Well-educated immigrants are three times more likely to start businesses than inhabitants of the US. The reduction in the number of new migrants would reduce the number of new businesses and this, in turn, would reduce job creation by an estimated 200000.
The remaining non-college educated migrants work mainly in lower-paid sectors such as retail and agriculture. They also play an important role in industries such as hospitality and food-related services. Many of the migrants send money to family members who remain in their home countries.

",Identify the relationship between the variables shown in Fig. 1.1 and suggest one possible reason for the relationship. [2],"a

Identify the relationship between the variables shown in Fig. 1.1 and suggest one possible reason for the relationship.
As the rate of unfilled jobs increases the foreign-born share of employment increases. (1) They are directly proportional. (1)
This suggests that the US uses immigrants to fill labour shortages. (1)Immigrants will be drawn to those occupations where there are most vacancies. (1)
Some jobs with the high foreign-born share rate and high unfilled job rate may be regarded as ‘starter’ jobs (1) which are taken initially whilst looking for something better. (1)

2

","The relationship between the variables in Fig. 1.1 is a positive correlation, as industries with higher percentages of unfilled job vacancies also tend to have a higher share of migrant workers in their workforce. This suggests that sectors experiencing labour shortages, such as agriculture or hospitality, increasingly rely on migrant labour to fill these vacancies, possibly because migrants are more willing to accept lower wages or less desirable working conditions compared to domestic workers."

","The production possibility curve (PPC) illustrates an economy’s maximum productive potential for two goods or services, given its resources and technology. A reduction in migration and the retirement of older workers affect the US’s productive potential differently. Retirement reduces the active labour force, a key factor of production, shifting the PPC inward (from PPC₁ to PPC₂ in a diagram), reflecting lower productive capacity. This occurs because fewer workers mean reduced output of goods and services. However, the prevention of migration primarily limits the *growth* of the labour force rather than reducing its current size. Since migrants were not yet part of the workforce (e.g., students or future workers), their absence does not immediately shrink existing resources, leaving the PPC unchanged in the short term. Over time, reduced migration may stifle innovation and entrepreneurship (as highlighted in the article), limiting long-term shifts outward, but this is distinct from the immediate inward shift caused by retirees exiting the workforce."

","Using the information and labour market theory, analyse why the wages received by migrant workers in the high-tech industries are likely to be higher than the wages received by migrant workers in the hospitality industry. [6]","c

Using the information and labour market theory, analyse why the wages received by migrant workers in the high-tech industries are likely to be higher than the wages received by migrant workers in the hospitality industry.
Demand:Theory suggests that the MPP of the educated will be higher than unskilled/less educated. (1)The value of the output of the educated will be greater than the less educated (1) anddemand will be higher resulting in higher wages (1).
Some college educated become entrepreneurs in high-tech industries and gain the benefits of profits which can be very high. (1)There may be prejudice against less educated workers which is reflected in their pay. (1)
Supply:The increase in immigrants has fallen and this may cause the wage gap for the low paid to narrow (1) and for the educated to widen. (1)

If a diagram is used award axes and all labels (1) relevant S&D (1)
Missing data if the immigrants are concentrated in particular areas this could lead to an ‘over-supply’ which will reduce the pay of the less educated. (1)

","The wages of migrant workers in high-tech industries are likely higher than those in hospitality due to differences in labour demand, supply conditions, and marginal productivity. According to labour market theory, wages reflect the marginal revenue product (MRP) of workers, which depends on their productivity and the value of their output. High-tech industries typically require specialised skills, such as science-based education, as stated in the article: ""half of migrants initially come as students, to be college educated, often in science-based subjects."" This education enhances their human capital, raising their marginal physical product (MPP) and enabling them to contribute more to high-value outputs like technological innovation. Consequently, demand for these workers is higher, shifting the demand curve (D1 to D2) and increasing equilibrium wages (W1 to W2) in a diagram of skilled labour markets.  

In contrast, hospitality roles often involve lower-skilled tasks with smaller MPP, as these jobs ""work mainly in lower-paid sectors such as retail and agriculture."" The supply of labour for such roles is more elastic due to lower entry barriers, leading to a larger pool of available workers. The article notes that non-college-educated migrants are concentrated in these sectors, creating a flatter supply curve. With abundant labour supply, wages remain low, as employers face less pressure to bid up pay.  

Additionally, the article highlights that educated migrants are ""three times more likely to start businesses,"" which increases their earnings potential through entrepreneurial profits. High-tech sectors also face lower wage elasticity of supply for skilled labour, as specialised training limits the number of qualified workers. Meanwhile, hospitality’s high elasticity ensures wages stay suppressed even if demand rises. Finally, wage disparities may reflect structural factors, such as the article’s observation that Hispanic workers earn ""16% less than the average,"" though this intersects with sectoral segregation. Thus, differences in MRP, supply elasticity, and skill scarcity systematically advantage high-tech migrant workers."

","The return to pre-2019 migration levels would likely have significant impacts on the US macroeconomic performance through multiple channels. Firstly, an increase in migration would expand the labour supply, particularly in sectors with high unfilled vacancies such as agriculture, hospitality, and high-tech industries, as indicated in Fig. 1.1. This would shift the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right, increasing potential output and reducing inflationary pressures. For instance, migrants filling roles in agriculture and retail could alleviate labour shortages, stabilising wage growth and prices in these sectors. Additionally, highly educated migrants entering high-tech industries could enhance productivity and innovation, further boosting aggregate supply.  

Secondly, higher migration would stimulate aggregate demand. Migrants, particularly those with lower average wages (earning 12% less than the US average), are likely to have a high marginal propensity to consume (MPC), increasing consumption expenditure. The multiplier effect would amplify this, as spending by migrants circulates through the economy, raising incomes and output in related industries. Furthermore, the article highlights that migrants are three times more likely to start businesses than US-born workers. New firms would increase investment and job creation, with an estimated 200,000 additional jobs, further elevating aggregate demand.  

However, remittances sent abroad by migrants, which reduce net exports (X–M), could worsen the US balance of payments. For example, Central American migrants sending income to families abroad would increase outflows in the current account, potentially widening the trade deficit. This leakage from the circular flow might partially offset the demand-side benefits.  

Regarding employment, while some argue that migrant labour could ""crowd out"" domestic workers, evidence from the extract suggests limited displacement. Migrants often fill roles in sectors with labour shortages (e.g., 35% of migrants work in agriculture and hospitality, where job vacancies are high), implying complementarity rather than competition. Moreover, migrant entrepreneurship generates new jobs, as seen in the link between migrant-founded businesses and employment growth.  

The combined expansion of aggregate demand and supply would likely increase real GDP, supported by a rightward shift in both AD and LRAS on an AD-AS diagram. This could enable non-inflationary growth, particularly if the economy operates below full capacity. However, the sustainability of this growth depends on structural factors, such as the integration of migrants into high-productivity sectors.  

In conclusion, while remittances pose a risk to the balance of payments, the net macroeconomic impact of restored migration levels would likely be positive. Increased labour supply, entrepreneurship, and consumption would enhance growth and employment, outweighing the costs. The US government’s macroeconomic objectives of stable growth and low unemployment would thus be better achieved with higher migration, provided policies ensure efficient labour market matching and address sectoral imbalances."

In May 2022, Sri Lanka had to admit that it was unable to pay its debts to other countries for the first time in its history. As a result, in February 2023 it was forced to obtain a loan of US$3bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The question is now, can Sri Lanka trade its way out of trouble?
The main problem faced by Sri Lanka for many years has been a lack of international competitiveness. Despite a growth in exports between 2000 and 2018, over the same period, they fell as a share of the economy from 39% to 23% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As a result, the country has found itself unable to earn enough foreign currency to pay for essential imports of food and fuel.

For many years, Sri Lanka has enjoyed a comparative advantage in growing and exporting tea. However, the ban on imports of fertilisers in 2021 which cut yields by a fifth and an overreliance on outdated methods of production have had a disastrous impact. Another major export is textiles, but these rely heavily on imported raw materials that have rapidly increased in price following the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. So, what alternatives exist for Sri Lanka?
Unlike in other Asian nations, Sri Lanka does not appear to have a plan to develop any new comparative advantage. Probably the most likely option would appear to be to take full use of its position at the centre of Indian Ocean shipping lanes by developing its ports. Sri Lanka could become a major shipping hub which would extend opportunities for exports. For example, approximately a third of the world’s oil is transported across the Indian Ocean. 
Other options include allowing the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate to boost exports because it is felt that the currency is overvalued. There are also suggestions that all import tariffs should be removed. Sri Lanka is currently one of the most protected economies in the World and removing tariffs may help attract much needed foreign investment and encourage local industries to become more efficient.
The question now is, could the introduction of these options lead Sri Lanka back into economic growth?

For a clear explanation of what is meant by a depreciation (1).

EvaluationThis will depend upon the:

PED of exports and imports with suitable explanation (1).


4

","A depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee refers to a fall in its value relative to other currencies, making exports cheaper for foreign buyers and imports more expensive for domestic consumers. This could improve the balance of trade by increasing the quantity of exports demanded (due to lower foreign prices) and reducing the quantity of imports demanded (due to higher domestic prices). For instance, Sri Lanka’s tea and textile exports might become more competitive globally if the rupee weakens, potentially raising export revenues. However, the extent of improvement depends critically on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for exports and imports. If exports have low PED (e.g., tea faces competition or lacks differentiation), a depreciation may not significantly boost export volumes, limiting revenue gains. Similarly, if imports like fuel and food are necessities with inelastic demand, higher prices from depreciation may not reduce import spending sufficiently. The article highlights that Sri Lanka’s textile exports rely on imported raw materials, which would become costlier post-depreciation, potentially offsetting gains. Thus, while depreciation could narrow the trade deficit (evident in Table 1.1’s shrinking deficits from –858 to –410), its effectiveness is constrained by structural factors like export composition and import dependency."

Possible advantages of retaining/not removing import tariffs e.g., to protect developing and declining industries from foreign competition, preserve levels of employment, prevent dumping etc. (up to 2 marks)
Possible advantages of removing import tariffs e.g., to remove the risk of retaliation, encourage foreign investment, encourage domestic industries etc. (up to 2 marks)

Up to 2 marks for evaluation:

That considers advantages of both alternatives to reach a valid conclusion as to whether the removal of all import tariffs is likely to reduce the deficit (reserve 1 mark).

Note: Ensure that the analysis is clearly focused on the effect on the trade balance. Accept reference to other forms of protectionism.

6

","The removal of all protectionism, such as import tariffs, could potentially reduce Sri Lanka’s balance of trade deficit, but this depends on how domestic industries and external markets respond. Removing tariffs would lower the cost of imported raw materials, which is particularly relevant for Sri Lanka’s textile industry, as highlighted in the article. Cheaper inputs could reduce production costs, making exports more price-competitive internationally. This would increase export volumes and foreign currency earnings, helping to narrow the trade deficit. Additionally, eliminating protectionism might attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as the article suggests, by signalling a commitment to open markets. FDI could enhance productivity and innovation in domestic industries, further boosting export capacity. Furthermore, removing tariffs could prevent retaliatory trade barriers from other nations, facilitating access to foreign markets for Sri Lankan goods.  

However, there are risks. Sudden removal of tariffs could lead to a surge in imports, particularly if domestic industries are uncompetitive. For instance, without tariffs, cheaper foreign goods might flood the market, displacing local producers and increasing import expenditure. This would worsen the trade deficit if export growth does not offset rising imports. The article notes Sri Lanka’s reliance on outdated production methods in sectors like tea, suggesting some industries may struggle to adapt without transitional support. Moreover, while lower input costs could aid textile exports, the sector’s heavy dependence on imported materials (vulnerable to global price shocks, as seen post-COVID and during the Ukraine conflict) means exchange rate stability and external factors remain critical.  

Ultimately, the effectiveness of removing protectionism hinges on structural reforms to improve competitiveness. If tariff removal is paired with investments in infrastructure (e.g., developing ports as a shipping hub, as mentioned) and policies to upgrade technology in key export sectors, the trade deficit could decline. However, without such measures, the immediate impact of cheaper imports might outweigh export gains, particularly if the rupee’s depreciation (also proposed in the article) fails to sufficiently enhance price competitiveness. Therefore, while tariff removal offers a pathway to reduce the deficit, its success is contingent on complementary policies addressing Sri Lanka’s underlying productivity challenges."

Up to 2 marks for evaluation:

6


","Supply-side policies could contribute to Sri Lanka’s economic growth by addressing structural inefficiencies and enhancing productive capacity. For instance, developing ports to exploit its strategic location in Indian Ocean shipping lanes could expand export opportunities, such as handling global oil transportation. This infrastructure investment would increase the economy’s productive potential, shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right. Similarly, removing high import tariffs—a supply-side reform—could incentivise foreign investment and stimulate competition, forcing domestic industries to improve efficiency through innovation and cost-cutting, aligning with theories of dynamic efficiency gains. Furthermore, reversing the fertiliser import ban and modernising tea production methods could restore comparative advantage in agriculture, raising export yields and addressing the ""overreliance on outdated methods"" cited in the article.  

However, supply-side policies face significant limitations in Sri Lanka’s context. The country’s immediate crisis—evident in persistent trade deficits (Table 1.1 shows monthly deficits exceeding $400m in 2023)—requires urgent foreign currency inflows, which supply-side measures like infrastructure projects cannot deliver quickly due to time lags. Port development, for example, demands years of investment, whereas Sri Lanka’s debt default and import dependency necessitate short-term solutions. Additionally, removing tariffs risks “crowding out” vulnerable domestic industries unprepared for global competition, potentially worsening unemployment and social instability. The textile sector’s reliance on costly imported materials, exacerbated by global supply shocks, highlights how external factors may undermine supply-side gains without complementary demand-side interventions, such as currency depreciation to lower export prices.  

While supply-side reforms are crucial for long-term growth, their effectiveness depends on parallel policies. For instance, rupee depreciation (a demand-side tool) could make exports cheaper, boosting demand for Sri Lankan goods while supply-side improvements enhance capacity. Similarly, IMF-backed fiscal discipline may stabilise public finances, creating investor confidence to amplify the impact of deregulation. Yet, Sri Lanka’s debt burden ($3bn IMF loan) limits funding for large-scale infrastructure, risking underinvestment in critical projects. Thus, while supply-side policies can gradually restore competitiveness—particularly in tea and shipping—their success hinges on addressing immediate liquidity crises and external shocks, suggesting they are necessary but insufficient alone to lead recovery."
14,"French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

Identify what caused the rise in the electricity prices and explain whether it can be concluded from the article that the price rise was an example of market failure.
Natural gas supply shortage (1) breakdown of nuclear reactors (1). Market failure occurs when price mechanism fails to account for all of the costs and benefits necessary to determine price equilibrium and this results in allocative inefficiency (accept alternative definitions of market failure) (2). There is no evidence of allocative inefficiency and no market failure (accept either) (1).

5

","The rise in electricity prices was caused by a combination of factors. A **global shortage of natural gas supplies** increased production costs, as gas-fired power plants are a significant source of electricity generation. Simultaneously, **faults in nuclear power plants** led to closures, particularly in France, where 18 out of 56 reactors were shut down due to safety concerns from corrosion, severely restricting supply. These supply-side shocks reduced market output, creating scarcity and driving up prices.  

To determine if this constitutes market failure, it is necessary to assess whether the price mechanism failed to account for social costs or benefits. Market failure occurs when free markets fail to achieve allocative efficiency (where P = MC). In this case, the price rise stemmed from **external supply shocks** (global gas shortages, technical failures in nuclear plants) rather than inherent market inefficiencies like monopolistic pricing, negative externalities, or information gaps. While the price surge harmed consumers, it reflected genuine scarcity from supply constraints, not a misallocation of resources. The article does not mention externalities or monopolistic exploitation beyond the state-instructed price controls. Therefore, the price rise cannot conclusively be labelled market failure, as it primarily represents a market adjustment to exogenous supply disruptions."

Is there any evidence in the article that the French government’s decisions will increase competition or efficiency in the energy market?
Competitors got cheaper electricity, so this maybe increases competition (1). Alternative renewable energy projects were stopped, so possibly leading to less efficiency (1).

","The article provides limited evidence that the French government’s decisions could increase competition but suggests inefficiencies may arise. By requiring the state-influenced electricity company to sell more power to competitors at a 40% discount, the government aims to reduce barriers for rival firms. This could theoretically enhance competition, as rivals gain cheaper access to electricity, enabling them to offer lower retail prices and challenge the dominant firm’s market share. However, the article highlights that the company’s reduced profits and share value may undermine dynamic efficiency, as lower retained earnings could limit investment in innovation or infrastructure. For instance, the government’s focus on capping prices has already restricted funding for renewable energy projects and new nuclear reactors, which are critical for long-term efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, the closure of 18 nuclear plants due to safety concerns reduces France’s self-sufficiency, forcing greater reliance on costlier or less efficient energy sources. While the policy may foster short-term competition through discounted prices, the lack of investment in modernising energy infrastructure and renewables suggests efficiency gains are unlikely. The article thus presents a mixed outcome, with tentative competitive benefits offset by clear risks to productive and dynamic efficiency."
16,"French electricity prices
In 2022 the French government ordered a large electricity company, partly owned by the state, to sell more electricity at lower prices than its rivals. The company said this would have a negative impact on its profits and result in a decrease in the value of the company's shares owned by the private sector.
Competitors in electricity supply in France are allowed to buy power from this company at a 40% discount due to its monopoly position. The government instructed the company to increase the amount they must sell to competitors at the discounted market price.
The government also cut taxes on electricity to try to keep the increase in prices for households and small businesses to 4%, rather than the expected 35%, without any government action. 
As well as producing electricity in France, the company owns nuclear power stations and gas-fired power stations in the UK and supplies 11% of the UK's electricity.
A global shortage of natural gas supplies caused a crisis, pushing up electricity prices. Much electricity is produced in gas-fired power plants. The situation was worsened by faults in the electricity-producing nuclear power plants in both the UK and France.
In January 2022 alone, a further five nuclear power plants in France were forced to close. That meant that 18 of the 56 plants had closed; a worrying proportion for a company that derives 70% of its electricity output from nuclear power. The plants were old. Corrosion caused safety fears and the closures restricted supplies.
Previously, the nuclear power plants put France in a strong self-sufficient position of which other European countries can only dream. The UK, for example, has to import expensive gas to produce electricity, where the price rise was expected to be not 35%, as in France, but 56%. However, the cost to the French government of reducing the electricity price affected its ability to finance renewable energy projects as well as build a new generation of nuclear reactors.
The government claimed the benefit was that they rescued millions of households from the prospect of excessive rises in electricity prices.

","Equality and equity are distinct concepts in economic analysis. Equality refers to the equal distribution of resources, such as income or wealth, across a population. For instance, a policy providing identical cash transfers to all households, irrespective of income levels, embodies equality by treating everyone uniformly. Equity, however, relates to fairness and justice in resource allocation, often requiring differentiated treatment to account for varying needs or circumstances. A progressive tax system, where higher-income individuals pay a larger proportion of their income in taxes, exemplifies equity by redistributing resources to reduce disparities and enhance social welfare. While equality emphasises uniformity, equity prioritises outcomes that address existing inequalities, ensuring access to opportunities is balanced despite differing starting points."

Consider whether the actions of the French government on electricity prices might be thought to increase either equality or equity for consumers and producers.
Cannot show that changes in price are linked to any notion of fairness, in relation to producer (1). Therefore, producer equity will be unaffected (1). A tax cut might increase consumer equity (1). Explanation (1) equality possibly, consumer rescued from excessive price increase (1) but as both rich and poor consumer benefit it is not conclusive that consumer equality is improved (1). Small firms will get cheaper electricity at the expense of large firms and this suggests an increase in equality between producers might be obtained (2). However, a cut in electricity taxes might benefit the large electricity company more than its smaller rivals, therefore any conclusion on the impact of equality for producers might remain uncertain (2).

","The French government’s intervention in electricity prices could be argued to enhance equity for consumers but has ambiguous effects on equality. By capping price rises at 4% for households and small businesses—compared to a projected 35% increase—the government aimed to shield vulnerable groups from unaffordable energy costs during a global gas crisis. This action aligns with equity, as it prioritises fairness by reducing disproportionate financial burdens on lower-income consumers. However, since the price cap and tax cuts apply universally, both wealthy and poorer households benefit equally, limiting progress toward equality of outcomes.  

For producers, the policy introduces mixed effects. Mandating the state-owned firm to sell more electricity at discounted prices to competitors (40% below market rate) could promote equality among producers by enabling smaller rivals to access cheaper inputs, fostering competition. However, this imposes costs on the state-owned company, reducing its profits and share value, which disproportionately affects private shareholders—a potential inequity. Meanwhile, tax cuts on electricity might disproportionately benefit larger firms with higher consumption, undermining equality between small and large producers.  

The government’s focus on shielding consumers may also compromise long-term equity. Redirecting resources to short-term price controls could hinder investment in renewable energy and new nuclear reactors, delaying equitable access to sustainable infrastructure. Thus, while consumer equity is prioritised, producer equity remains contested, and equality gains are partial or uncertain. The policies reflect trade-offs between immediate fairness and structural imbalances, leaving their overall impact on equality and equity unresolved."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a form of technological progress. It involves computers or computercontrolled robots engaging in tasks usually performed by humans. Many businesses invest in AI to reduce their costs, to increase their efficiency by reducing human errors and to raise business revenues and profits.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process – from increased use of contactless card payment systems to large-scale investment in driverless taxis. In China, a leading internet search company plans to follow some of its rivals in the United States (US) by starting a driverless taxi service in 100 cities by 2030.
Nevertheless, the pace of growth in AI has raised concerns that this will result in increased unemployment. One study suggests that up to 38% of US jobs are at risk from automation by the mid-2030s. To date, Japan has between 200 and 300 AI companies. It is also the leading supplier of industrial robots and third, behind China and the US, in spending on research and development into AI.
Just a few years ago, the growth of the internet created similar fears. Despite these concerns, the technology created millions of jobs and contributed as much as 10.5% towards US GDP in 2020. As a result, some economists suggest that the movement towards AI will fundamentally change the world and the way we work and live but will not lead to large rises in unemployment. AI technology may create more jobs than it destroys.
Nonetheless, the danger remains that automation will lead to a society of winners and losers. These newly created jobs will require new skills and significant investment in training young people and retraining adults. Therefore, governments may need to implement targeted policies to ensure that any changes to structural unemployment are only short-lived. However, rising national debt alongside projections of low economic growth, as shown in Table 1.1, may reduce the ability of governments to deliver such policies.

","Increased investment in AI in Japan is likely to have contrasting short-term and long-term impacts on unemployment. In the short run, structural unemployment may rise as AI replaces labour in routine tasks, particularly in manufacturing and transport sectors. For instance, the expansion of driverless taxi services, as highlighted in the article, could displace thousands of drivers whose skills become obsolete. Similarly, Japan’s status as a leading supplier of industrial robots suggests automation could reduce demand for assembly line workers, increasing job losses in sectors reliant on manual or repetitive work. This aligns with the article’s reference to 38% of US jobs being at risk, indicating Japan’s vulnerability to similar trends.  

However, in the long run, AI investment may create new job opportunities through technological spillovers. The article notes that the internet, despite initial fears, contributed 10.5% to US GDP by creating roles in software development and digital services. Similarly, AI could generate demand for high-skilled positions in AI maintenance, data analysis, and cybersecurity. Japan’s focus on AI R&D (third globally) may stimulate growth in tech hubs, fostering innovation-led employment. Additionally, AI-driven efficiency gains could lower production costs, enabling firms to expand output and hire workers in non-automated roles, such as creative or managerial positions.  

Nevertheless, the transition’s success depends on mitigating skill mismatches. The article warns that AI-related jobs require “significant investment in training,” which may challenge Japan’s ageing workforce and rigid labour markets. Without retraining programmes, displaced workers could face prolonged unemployment, exacerbating income inequality. While Japan’s high debt (mentioned in the extract) may constrain public funding for education, its strong industrial base and existing AI firms could facilitate private-sector-led upskilling. Overall, while AI may initially raise unemployment, its long-term impact hinges on institutional adaptability, suggesting net job creation is achievable but not guaranteed."

","The growth of AI is likely to influence Japan’s specialisation and trade in several ways. On one hand, AI could deepen Japan’s comparative advantage in high-tech manufacturing, particularly in industrial robotics, where it is already a global leader. By integrating AI into production processes, Japan could achieve greater productivity and cost efficiency, reducing marginal costs (MC) and enabling lower prices for exports. This would enhance international competitiveness, increasing export demand and improving the trade balance. For instance, the article highlights Japan’s position as the “leading supplier of industrial robots,” suggesting that AI-driven automation could further solidify its dominance in this sector, fostering specialisation through technological advancement. Additionally, AI-powered innovations in areas like driverless taxis could create new export markets, diversifying trade opportunities.

However, over-specialisation in AI-intensive industries carries risks. Excessive reliance on automation might reduce flexibility in responding to shifts in global demand, particularly if other countries develop comparable technologies. The article notes that AI could create “structural unemployment” if displaced workers lack retraining opportunities, potentially shrinking the labour force in non-AI sectors and distorting resource allocation. This could weaken Japan’s capacity to diversify its export base, increasing vulnerability to trade shocks in its specialised industries. Furthermore, while AI may lower production costs, initial R&D investments—such as the spending highlighted in the article—could strain fiscal resources, limiting funds for other sectors and distorting comparative advantage over time.

In conclusion, while AI is likely to reinforce Japan’s specialisation in advanced manufacturing and boost trade competitiveness through efficiency gains, the risks of over-reliance and structural unemployment necessitate balanced policies. Japan’s ability to mitigate these drawbacks through targeted retraining programs—despite fiscal constraints—will determine whether AI’s net impact on trade and specialisation is positive."
23,"The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.
Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth. The mining industry declined. Thousands of jobs were lost despite South Africa having significant deposits of platinum, gold and iron ore.
For South Africa’s economy to grow it needs to address major infrastructure issues. Also, in disadvantaged communities the education system is weak contributing to a skills shortage and a rise in the unemployment rate to 27% (see Fig. 1.2). Increased production is further hindered by restrictive trade union practices.

An analyst said: ‘A critical reason for low economic growth has been a lack of private sector investment and FDI (see Fig. 1.3). The lack of investment wasn’t just due to the political policies but also to uncertainty and mismanagement which led to continued inequalities.’

This aligns with Okun’s Law, which posits that negative economic growth (recession) leads to higher unemployment due to reduced aggregate demand. When GDP falls, firms cut production, leading to layoffs and cyclical unemployment. For instance, the electricity supply rationing and mining industry decline mentioned in the extract reduced output, exacerbating job losses. However, structural factors like skills shortages and restrictive union practices may also contribute to persistent unemployment, even if growth resumes.

","The state-owned electricity monopoly’s performance is presented as a significant contributor to South Africa’s economic decline. As a state-owned monopoly, the electricity supplier’s mismanagement led to rationing and regular power cuts, directly reducing production capacity across industries. The article states that these power cuts caused “decreases in production and increases in unemployment,” highlighting how electricity shortages disrupted industrial activity, particularly in energy-intensive sectors like mining and manufacturing. This aligns with the concept of supply-side constraints, where insufficient infrastructure reduces productive capacity, lowering actual GDP growth below potential. Furthermore, the electricity company’s debts are described as adding “significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56%,” compounding fiscal pressures and limiting the government’s ability to invest in other areas.  

The article explicitly labels the electricity monopoly’s debts as “the biggest threat to the economy,” suggesting its centrality relative to other issues. For instance, while the mining industry declined due to reforms and bureaucracy, the electricity crisis exacerbated its struggles by raising operational costs and reducing output. Similarly, power cuts likely worsened unemployment in sectors already facing challenges, contributing to the 27% unemployment rate. However, the evidence lacks quantitative specifics, such as the exact percentage of GDP decline directly attributable to electricity shortages, making it difficult to isolate its impact compared to other factors like skills shortages or restrictive trade unions.  

The electricity monopoly’s role is further underscored by its systemic importance. Electricity underpins all economic activity, meaning its failure creates multiplier effects. For example, unreliable power deters private investment and FDI, as noted in the analyst’s comment linking low growth to “uncertainty and mismanagement.” Without electricity, even well-endowed sectors like mining cannot exploit South Africa’s natural resources, stifling export revenues and job creation. While other issues like education and mining reforms are cited, the article prioritises the electricity crisis as the primary threat, implying its disproportionate significance. Nevertheless, the absence of comparative data on sectoral contributions limits a definitive assessment of its exact weight in the overall decline."
26,"The decline of South Africa’s economy
South Africa is the most industrialised country in the continent of Africa but it is also an economy with much economic inequality.
Recently governments in South Africa have aimed to reduce economic inequalities by redistributing incomes and increasing both job and investment opportunities for all sections of society. Unfortunately, the reforms have been undermined through poor organisation and management. State railways, port facilities, airways and electricity production have been affected.
Government statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that South Africa’s economy contracted by 3.2%, the biggest quarterly decline of actual economic growth in a decade (see Fig. 1.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$6130 in December 2019, 5.8% lower than in December 2018.

This economic decline is reflected in the electricity supply industry, which is a state-owned monopoly. It is struggling to survive mainly due to mismanagement. For several months it rationed electricity consumption and introduced regular power cuts for households and industries. The rationing policy led to decreases in production and increases in unemployment. The company’s debts added significantly to South Africa’s current national debt to GDP ratio of 56% and are seen as the biggest threat to the economy.
Further evidence of economic difficulties can be found in the mining industry, a significant part of South Africa’s economy. A controversial reform was introduced to give more equality of ownership. Already facing rising costs and growing bureaucracy, many mining firms, including multinational companies, stopped investing altogether which reduced potential economic growth.

",Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy. [7],"d

Evaluate whether attracting investment and managing uncertainty are the most effective ways to improve the prospects for South Africa’s economy.
Various government reforms and poor performances of some state industries have undermined confidence in the entire South African economy. (1)
This can be illustrated by the lack of investment by the private sector in the mining industry leading to increasing unemployment. (1)
The South African economy has also been diminished in the international economy as indicated by the fall in FDI (Figure 3) (1)
High unemployment means low consumer expenditure and low growth in AD. (1)
Future prospects for improvement seem limited in the short run (1). Longer term it needs to overcome a skills shortage by reforming education (1) and restrictive trade union practices. (1) Nevertheless, there is some increase in FDI (1). Longer term increase in infrastructure (1). An increase in employment/economic growth in the economy (1)

","The effectiveness of attracting investment and managing uncertainty in improving South Africa’s economic prospects must be evaluated within the context of its structural challenges. On one hand, the lack of private sector investment and FDI, as evidenced by the mining industry’s decline and falling FDI in Fig. 1.3, has directly contributed to rising unemployment and stagnant growth. Attracting investment could stimulate aggregate demand through capital inflows, job creation, and technological transfers, addressing short-term contraction. Managing uncertainty, such as policy instability and mismanagement in state monopolies like electricity, is critical to restoring investor confidence. For instance, the electricity rationing and power cuts reduced industrial output, exacerbating unemployment. Stabilising governance and clarifying reforms could reduce risk perceptions, encouraging firms to reinvest, as seen in economies recovering from crises through improved institutional credibility.

However, structural barriers limit the efficacy of these measures alone. The skills shortage, driven by a weak education system, constrains productivity gains even with increased investment. Without addressing educational reforms to enhance human capital, higher investment may not translate into sustainable growth. Similarly, infrastructure deficits, such as inefficient ports and railways, raise production costs, deterring long-term investment. Restrictive trade union practices further hinder competitiveness, suggesting labor market reforms are necessary to complement investment. While FDI and private investment can provide immediate liquidity, long-term growth requires resolving systemic issues like infrastructure and education, which are prerequisites for maximizing returns on investment.

Moreover, the mining sector’s struggles highlight that policy uncertainty alone is not the sole deterrent—controversial ownership reforms created disincentives despite good intentions. Thus, while managing uncertainty is vital, policy design must balance equity and efficiency to avoid unintended consequences. Comparatively, Japan’s high debt-to-GDP ratio shows context matters: South Africa’s 56% ratio may be manageable if paired with growth-oriented reforms. Ultimately, attracting investment and reducing uncertainty are necessary but insufficient without parallel structural adjustments. A holistic approach, integrating short-term stabilisation with long-term human and physical capital development, is likely the most effective strategy for sustainable economic improvement."
27,"Economic decline in 2020
In 2020, Japan suffered its third quarterly decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in a row. The size of its real GDP shrank to its lowest level since 2011 when the country was suffering from 20 years of deflation and economic stagnation. In 2020, the economy was not helped by a previous increase in sales tax, the COVID-19 pandemic and the trade war between the world's biggest economies, the United States (US) and China. They were Japan's two most significant trading partners; 19.9% of exports went to the US and 19% to China. Table 1.1 gives some economic indicators for Japan for selected years.

Japan, which was the world's fourth largest exporter, incurred an overall trade deficit of US$15.2 billion for 2019, an increase of almost 50% on the trade deficit for 2018. In 2020, exports fell by a further 18.5% in the third quarter, mainly caused by a decline in Japan's motor vehicle exports. In that quarter, its main car producer, one of the world's biggest car companies, made its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as sales halved. 
The government of Japan used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to try to stimulate the economy. Low interest rates had been used by the central bank since 2016. In August 2020, economists said that despite this stimulus to encourage growth there was a chance economic activity may stagnate even further if major nations again adopted more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to combat any reoccurrence of the pandemic.

","Japan’s trade deficits, despite being a major exporter, can arise if the total value of its imports exceeds the value of its exports. One reason is that Japan’s exports, such as motor vehicles, faced declining demand due to external shocks. The article states that Japan’s exports fell by 18.5% in the third quarter of 2020, driven by reduced motor vehicle exports, with its main car producer experiencing halved sales and a nine-year low in profits. This sharp decline in a key export sector reduced export revenue, worsening the trade balance. Additionally, Japan’s reliance on imports of raw materials, energy, or intermediate goods for its manufacturing industries may have remained high, increasing import expenditure even as export earnings fell.  

Furthermore, global trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and reduced demand from major trading partners. The US-China trade war and pandemic-related lockdowns likely lowered import demand in these economies, which together account for nearly 40% of Japan’s exports. For instance, falling industrial production in Japan (0.1% growth in 2019, as per Table 1.1) suggests weaker export capacity, while price inelasticity for essential imports (e.g., oil) could mean import values stayed high despite lower export revenues. These factors collectively explain how export dominance in specific sectors does not preclude an overall trade deficit if import costs outstrip export earnings."

","The evidence provided suggests that while the COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to Japan’s economic decline in 2020, it was not the sole cause, as pre-existing structural weaknesses and policy decisions also played a role. On one hand, the pandemic directly exacerbated economic challenges: Japan’s GDP contracted by 7.8% between April and June 2020, coinciding with global lockdowns that disrupted supply chains and reduced demand. Exports fell by 18.5% in the third quarter, driven by a sharp decline in motor vehicle exports, as “sales halved” for its main car producer. The IMF’s warning of a global recession, alongside contractions in the US (9.5%) and China (3.2%), highlights the pandemic’s widespread demand-side shocks, particularly affecting trade-dependent economies like Japan. These figures align with the pandemic’s timing, suggesting it intensified existing vulnerabilities.  

However, Japan’s economic struggles predated 2020. The extract notes “20 years of deflation and economic stagnation” prior to 2011, and Table 1.1 reveals persistent issues: stagnant industrial production (0.1% growth in 2019) and declining retail sales (0.1% in 2019, down from 1.7% in 2018), likely worsened by a 2019 sales tax increase. The national debt, already at 237% of GDP in 2019, limited fiscal flexibility, while the US-China trade war reduced demand for Japanese exports, as 38.9% of exports went to these economies. The 50% rise in Japan’s trade deficit between 2018 and 2019 further indicates weakening trade performance before the pandemic. Thus, while COVID-19 accelerated the 2020 decline, Japan’s economy was already constrained by long-term deflation, high debt, and external trade pressures.  

In conclusion, the pandemic acted as a catalyst rather than the root cause. The simultaneous timing of lockdowns and the GDP contraction strongly links COVID-19 to the 2020 decline. However, structural inefficiencies, such as reliance on stagnant industrial sectors, and policy missteps, including the sales tax hike, created a fragile economic base. Without these pre-existing conditions, the pandemic’s impact might have been less severe. Therefore, the evidence shows Japan’s decline was the result of compounding factors, with the pandemic exacerbating, but not solely causing, the downturn."

In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)
In theory the low interest rates should discourage saving and increased consumption but the pattern of retail sales seems to contradict this expectation. (2)
Also, low interest rates should encourage borrowing for industrial investment to expand capital assets but industrial production has declined significantly after 2017 (2)
Policy appears to have worked best in 2017 when industrial production and retail sales improved significantly linked to the highest rate of economic growth year-on-year.
However the fall in exports, trade wars (US − China) and high levels of public debt have continued to lead to more stagnation. This has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 (2)

","Low interest rates can stimulate an economy through multiple channels. By reducing the cost of borrowing, they incentivize households and firms to increase consumption and investment. For instance, lower mortgage rates may boost demand for housing, while cheaper business loans could fund capital expansion, raising aggregate demand (AD) and output. Additionally, low rates reduce the incentive to save, encouraging spending on goods and services. This aligns with the Keynesian transmission mechanism, where monetary policy influences AD via interest-sensitive components like investment (I) and consumption (C). Furthermore, low rates may weaken the exchange rate, as investors seek higher returns elsewhere, making exports more competitive—a critical factor for export-dependent economies like Japan. This could improve net trade (X-M), further stimulating growth.

However, Japan’s experience since 2016 reveals mixed outcomes. While the central bank maintained a 0.1% interest rate, industrial production growth peaked at 3.1% in 2017 alongside a 2.2% GDP growth rate and 1.9% retail sales growth, suggesting temporary success. This aligns with theory: cheaper borrowing likely spurred short-term investment and consumption. Yet, by 2018–2019, industrial production growth fell to 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively, while retail sales growth halved, indicating diminishing returns. The persistence of near-zero rates may have led to a liquidity trap, where further rate cuts fail to stimulate demand due to entrenched deflationary expectations. Firms, anticipating weak consumer spending, may have avoided long-term investments despite low borrowing costs. Moreover, Japan’s aging population and high savings rate likely muted the impact of low rates on consumption, as risk-averse households prioritized saving over spending despite minimal returns.

Structural and external factors further limited efficacy. Japan’s national debt remained above 230% of GDP, constraining fiscal flexibility and exacerbating crowding-out fears. The 2019 trade deficit widening to $15.2 billion and the 2020 18.5% export decline—driven by falling motor vehicle demand—highlight vulnerability to external shocks like the US-China trade war and pandemic. These factors overwhelmed monetary stimulus, as export-oriented sectors faced collapsing external demand. Consequently, even with sustained low rates, Japan’s economy shrank by 7.8% in Q2 2020, underscoring the limits of monetary policy amid global crises. Thus, while low rates provided partial relief in 2017, their success was undermined by structural weaknesses and exogenous shocks, revealing the necessity of complementary fiscal and structural reforms for sustained recovery."

China's economic performance in 2020 was the exception. China was the first country to experience the pandemic. It has also been the first economy to recover from recession, a period of two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The Chinese government was quick to enforce lockdowns to limit the pandemic and there was rapidly increasing demand for exports of PPE (personal protection equipment) and other Chinese-made products. 
The case of neighbouring South Korea was different. Like China, the impact of the pandemic was more effectively contained than in other economies and growth in South Korea’s economy was less affected. There was, however, little evidence in the data that by the end of 2020, South Korea’s economy would recover to its pre-2019 position of strong economic growth. 
The economies of the US and the UK had negative quarterly economic growth throughout 2020. Economists in these countries have disagreed about how best to increase the rate of economic growth after the pandemic. The governments of both countries introduced very high government spending programmes to encourage the return to economic growth in 2021. However, monetary policies have been widely promoted by many economists as an alternative to more traditional fiscal measures.

State two likely economic reasons why China experienced strong economic growth starting in the second quarter of 2020 and consider which of these is likely to have generated the greater rate of growth.
Plausible reasons could include:

The increased demand for exports of PPE (1)
First to experience Covid and therefore the first to recover from it due to e.g., the speed of enforcing lockdowns. (1)
Successful government policies – one mark per stated policy e.g., fiscal, and monetary policies (1)

Up to two marks for explaining why one of the stated reasons is likely to have generated the greatest growth. (1+1)

4

","China experienced strong economic growth starting in the second quarter of 2020 due to two key factors. First, the Chinese government’s rapid enforcement of lockdowns limited the spread of the pandemic early, allowing economic activity to resume sooner than in other economies. This is noted in the article: “China was the first country to experience the pandemic... [and] quick to enforce lockdowns to limit the pandemic”. Second, there was a surge in global demand for Chinese exports such as PPE, as stated: “rapidly increasing demand for exports of PPE and other Chinese-made products” drove recovery.  

The increased export demand likely generated a greater rate of growth. Exports directly contribute to GDP through net external demand, and the sudden global reliance on Chinese manufacturing for critical goods would have created a substantial short-term boost. While effective lockdowns were essential to restart production, the scale of export growth—fuelled by unprecedented international demand—would have had a more immediate and significant multiplier effect on output, employment, and industrial activity. Without this export surge, even a swift lockdown exit might not have delivered such rapid growth."

For a justified conclusion (1)


6

","China's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic likely had significant effects on employment and price stability. The recovery, driven by strict lockdowns and surging export demand for PPE and other goods, would have increased aggregate demand (AD) through components such as consumption (C), investment (I), and net exports (X–M). Higher AD stimulates production, raising derived demand for labour and reducing unemployment. For instance, expanded manufacturing to meet global PPE demand would create jobs in industrial sectors, improving employment levels. Additionally, government measures to sustain growth, such as infrastructure spending, could further boost employment in construction and related industries.  

However, the impact on price stability depends on the economy’s position relative to its productive capacity. If recovery occurred while there was spare capacity (e.g., underutilised resources or labour), inflationary pressures might have been limited initially. Yet, as AD continued to rise, demand-pull inflation could emerge if output approached full employment. For example, bottlenecks in supply chains for export goods might raise production costs, leading to cost-push inflation. The article highlights China’s rapid export-led recovery, which could strain resources, increasing prices for raw materials and labour, particularly in high-demand sectors.  

The extent of these effects hinges on the speed and scale of recovery. A gradual rebound might allow supply to adjust, maintaining price stability, while a rapid surge in AD could overheat the economy. Given China’s swift recovery and reliance on exports, employment likely improved significantly, but inflationary risks may have intensified in key sectors. Overall, while employment benefits are clear, price stability risks depend on how effectively supply capacities matched recovering demand."

","Monetary policies, which involve central banks adjusting interest rates and influencing money supply, can play a significant role in stimulating economic recovery in high-income countries like the US and the UK. By lowering interest rates, central banks reduce borrowing costs for households and firms, encouraging consumption and investment, which increases aggregate demand (AD). For instance, cheaper mortgages may boost housing demand, while lower corporate loan rates could incentivise business expansion. Expansionary monetary policy may also involve quantitative easing (QE), where central banks purchase government bonds to inject liquidity into financial markets, lowering long-term interest rates and supporting asset prices. Additionally, a depreciation in the exchange rate caused by loose monetary policy could enhance export competitiveness, as seen in the UK’s post-2008 recovery, improving the trade balance and AD.  

However, the effectiveness of monetary policy is constrained by several factors. In economies already experiencing near-zero interest rates, such as the US and UK during the pandemic, further rate cuts become impossible, a situation termed the *liquidity trap*. Even with low rates, weak consumer and business confidence may limit spending, as seen in 2020 when households increased savings despite rate reductions. Furthermore, QE risks inflating asset prices disproportionately, exacerbating wealth inequality without significantly boosting real output. A weaker exchange rate could also raise import prices, contributing to cost-push inflation, which erodes purchasing power—a concern given post-pandemic supply chain disruptions. Monetary policy also suffers from time lags, as it takes months for rate changes to permeate the economy, delaying recovery.  

By contrast, fiscal policy—such as direct government spending on infrastructure or welfare—can target specific sectors and immediately inject demand into the economy. The US and UK deployed large fiscal packages in 2020–21 to support incomes and businesses, which arguably had a more direct impact than monetary tools. However, excessive reliance on fiscal policy risks unsustainable public debt, particularly if growth remains sluggish. A balanced approach combining monetary easing to maintain low borrowing costs with targeted fiscal stimulus may be optimal. For example, the Bank of England’s low rates in 2021 reduced the cost of government borrowing, enabling higher spending without destabilising debt ratios. Ultimately, while monetary policy is a critical tool, its efficacy in isolation is limited by structural and cyclical constraints, necessitating complementary fiscal measures to ensure a robust recovery."

However, the rise of electric car sales could slow within the next few years due to a worldwide shortage of the supply of lithium needed for car batteries. Demand for lithium could triple by 2025 to one million tonnes per year and then double again to two million tonnes per year by 2030. A typical lithium mine produces 30000 tonnes per year which means the market needs approximately four new mines per year to meet demand. However, it usually takes about six years to discover, develop and put a lithium mine into production.
Rising global sales of electric cars are impacting on world oil producers. The boom years for the oil industry are over as economies start to deal with climate change. This will have significant implications for petrostates (countries whose economies are almost totally reliant on oil and gas). 
Volatile oil prices, as illustrated in Table 1.1, have already left many petrostate governments struggling. The governments of most Middle Eastern oil producing countries cannot maintain a balanced budget at the 2020 average oil price of around US$40. Years of unstable oil revenues have left these countries with significant levels of national debt.
Venezuela offers a cautionary tale. Serious mismanagement has caused its oil output in 2020 to drop to about 10% of its 2000 level. Gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen by more than 75% in the past 5 years and more than 5 million people have left the country.
The solution is diversification. Wealthy Middle East states, such as Oman and Saudi Arabia, are investing in renewable energy and international tourism. Attempts at change by less wealthy petrostates such as Venezuela are hampered by a lack of capital at home and because they are often unable to attract international investors. As a result, they tend to focus on short-term rather than long-term economic growth.
Ultimately, many petrostates are likely to need outside support to diversify their economies. In addition to financial aid, it is suggested that wealthy countries should also offer technical assistance such as retraining workers, help designing new tax systems and support with the adoption of renewable energy.

With the help of a diagram, explain why the supply problem referred to may lead to increases in the price of electric cars in the future and consider one policy that may be used to overcome this supply problem.
The shortage of lithium may be caused by a fall in its supply or an increase in its demand (not matched by an increase in its supply). For an accurate supply and demand diagram showing the effect on the price of lithium and/or the price of electric cars due to either of these changes (1) explaining that this will add to the cost of production of electric cars (1) and therefore increase the price of electric cars (1).
IF an accurate supply and demand diagram is drawn to illustrate the increase in the price of electric cars without any reference to the price of lithium and its importance as a cost of production then 1 mark MAX.
Clearly there are several potential valid policies, but these must clearly address the problems identified in the data i.e., a worldwide shortage in the supply of lithium needed for car batteries in electric vehicles. Evaluation must therefore focus on increasing the supply of lithium and not electric cars and methods may include:

R and D into alternative raw materials other than lithium or improve its extraction
Tax and subsidy incentives to increase R and D
Tax and subsidy incentives to increase the number of lithium mines.

Identify and explain valid policy and briefly explain how that this might overcome the problem of a lack of lithium (1)
Guidance Any valid way should be rewarded but it must clearly relate to the problems identified in the data and explain how the problem may be overcome for full marks.

","The supply problem of lithium, a key component in electric car batteries, may lead to future price increases for electric cars due to rising production costs. As global demand for lithium is projected to triple by 2025 and double again by 2030, supply constraints are likely because opening new lithium mines takes approximately six years. This creates an inelastic supply response to growing demand. In a supply and demand diagram for lithium, the supply curve (S) would shift leftward from S1 to S2 due to the shortage, while demand (D) shifts rightward from D1 to D2 as electric car production expands. The intersection of S2 and D2 results in a higher equilibrium price for lithium (from P1 to P2). Since lithium is a critical input, this raises marginal costs for car manufacturers, shifting the supply curve for electric cars leftward and increasing their market price.  

One policy to address this could be government subsidies for lithium mining. By reducing extraction costs through financial incentives, subsidies would encourage faster development of new mines, shifting the lithium supply curve back to the right (from S2 to S1) and lowering its price. This would mitigate cost pressures on electric car producers, stabilising or reducing their prices. Additionally, subsidies could accelerate the mining approval process, shortening the six-year lag and improving supply responsiveness to demand growth."

","The unemployment arising from the diversification of petrostates away from oil and gas production is likely to be **structural** rather than cyclical. Cyclical unemployment occurs due to fluctuations in aggregate demand during economic downturns, such as temporary falls in oil prices reducing demand for labour in the oil sector. However, diversification involves a long-term shift in the economy’s structure, moving resources from declining industries (e.g., oil) to emerging sectors (e.g., renewable energy or tourism). Workers in petrostates’ oil industries often possess skills specific to that sector, such as drilling or refinery operations, which are not transferable to new industries. This creates a **mismatch between labour skills and job requirements**, a hallmark of structural unemployment. For example, the extract highlights that petrostates like Saudi Arabia are investing in renewable energy, which demands technical expertise that oil workers may lack without retraining. Similarly, Venezuela’s reliance on oil has left its workforce unprepared for alternative sectors, exacerbating structural unemployment as the economy collapses.

Structural unemployment is likely to be **more damaging** to petrostates than cyclical unemployment. Cyclical unemployment can be addressed through demand-side policies, such as fiscal stimulus to boost spending and rehire workers when oil prices recover. However, structural unemployment requires **supply-side reforms**, such as retraining programmes or education systems overhaul, which are costly and time-consuming. The extract notes that less wealthy petrostates like Venezuela lack the capital to fund such initiatives and struggle to attract international investors, delaying diversification. Prolonged structural unemployment erodes human capital as skills become obsolete, leading to hysteresis and long-term economic scarring. By contrast, cyclical unemployment caused by temporary oil price volatility (e.g., the 2020 price collapse to US$39.7 per barrel) could reverse if prices rebound, allowing workers to return to their original roles. However, the shift towards electric cars and renewable energy is **permanent**, meaning oil demand may not recover, making structural unemployment a persistent issue. Without external support for retraining and investment, petrostates risk entrenched unemployment, social instability, and dependency on finite oil revenues, making structural unemployment far more damaging in this context."
40,"Electric cars create challenges for oil producers
Oil companies are facing uncertainty in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic causes a collapse in demand for their product, but car producers are predicting the pandemic will help accelerate the use of electric cars. Looking ahead, cuts in investment by oil companies as their revenues fall could reduce supply enough to cause a rise in oil prices. This makes electric cars more attractive just as car producers increase production.

However, the rise of electric car sales could slow within the next few years due to a worldwide shortage of the supply of lithium needed for car batteries. Demand for lithium could triple by 2025 to one million tonnes per year and then double again to two million tonnes per year by 2030. A typical lithium mine produces 30000 tonnes per year which means the market needs approximately four new mines per year to meet demand. However, it usually takes about six years to discover, develop and put a lithium mine into production.
Rising global sales of electric cars are impacting on world oil producers. The boom years for the oil industry are over as economies start to deal with climate change. This will have significant implications for petrostates (countries whose economies are almost totally reliant on oil and gas). 
Volatile oil prices, as illustrated in Table 1.1, have already left many petrostate governments struggling. The governments of most Middle Eastern oil producing countries cannot maintain a balanced budget at the 2020 average oil price of around US$40. Years of unstable oil revenues have left these countries with significant levels of national debt.
Venezuela offers a cautionary tale. Serious mismanagement has caused its oil output in 2020 to drop to about 10% of its 2000 level. Gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen by more than 75% in the past 5 years and more than 5 million people have left the country.
The solution is diversification. Wealthy Middle East states, such as Oman and Saudi Arabia, are investing in renewable energy and international tourism. Attempts at change by less wealthy petrostates such as Venezuela are hampered by a lack of capital at home and because they are often unable to attract international investors. As a result, they tend to focus on short-term rather than long-term economic growth.
Ultimately, many petrostates are likely to need outside support to diversify their economies. In addition to financial aid, it is suggested that wealthy countries should also offer technical assistance such as retraining workers, help designing new tax systems and support with the adoption of renewable energy.

and reaches a justified conclusion as to which country's economic growth is most likely to be impacted.

GuidanceClearly, according to the extract, the common problem for both economies is the forecast fall in oil demand led by the need to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change. However, as the data also makes clear, the impact of this will be different for countries such as Saudi Arabia and countries such as Venezuela, and the analysis and evaluation must refer to these differences for full marks. Points to consider from the extract may include:

The relative wealth and access to both internal and external capital
The relative focus on short- and long-term growth
The relative ease of diversifying e.g., Saudi Arabia has already begun investing in renewable energy and tourism, whereas Venezuela is suffering high rates of emigration and lacks the funds to do so.
The possible difference in the willingness of other economies to offer the needed support to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela respectively and the possible difference in the receptiveness to any aid offered.

","Diversification is likely to be more successful in Saudi Arabia than in Venezuela due to disparities in wealth, access to capital, and institutional stability. Saudi Arabia, as a wealthy petrostate, has already begun investing in renewable energy and international tourism, leveraging its substantial financial reserves to fund long-term projects. The extract highlights that such investments are feasible for wealthier states, which can mobilise domestic capital and attract international investors—factors critical for developing new industries. By contrast, Venezuela faces severe economic mismanagement, with GDP collapsing by over 75% in five years and oil output dropping to 10% of its 2000 levels. This has left the country with significant debt, a lack of capital, and an inability to attract foreign investment, forcing it to prioritise short-term survival over structural diversification. Additionally, Venezuela’s high emigration rate (5 million people leaving) erodes its human capital, further limiting its capacity to innovate or retrain workers for new sectors.

Saudi Arabia benefits from greater geopolitical stability and international credibility, making it more likely to receive technical assistance and financial aid from wealthy nations. The extract suggests that external support, such as retraining programs and renewable energy adoption, is crucial for diversification. Saudi Arabia’s existing initiatives align with global trends towards sustainability, enhancing its appeal to investors. Conversely, Venezuela’s political instability and historical mismanagement deter foreign support, as lenders perceive higher risks. While Saudi Arabia can exploit its sovereign wealth to subsidise transitions—such as developing tourism infrastructure or solar energy projects—Venezuela lacks this capacity, relying instead on depleted oil revenues and struggling to implement even basic reforms. 

However, diversification is not without challenges for Saudi Arabia. Its economy remains deeply entrenched in oil, and shifting labour markets may face resistance from populations accustomed to state-subsidised employment. Yet, these hurdles are less insurmountable than Venezuela’s systemic crises. Ultimately, Saudi Arabia’s financial resources, strategic investments, and access to international cooperation position it more favourably for successful diversification. Venezuela’s profound economic collapse, capital flight, and political dysfunction create a vicious cycle that external aid alone cannot resolve, making sustained diversification unlikely without prior institutional reform. Thus, Saudi Arabia is better placed to reduce oil dependence effectively."
41,"Economic growth in Taiwan
In 2021, Taiwan's economy is forecast to grow at its fastest rate in seven years, encouraged by increasing global demand for its technology products. Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise by 4.6% in 2021.
Exports from Taiwan's electronics industry include gaming devices, laptops, devices that aid cloud computing and semiconductors for car production. Taiwan is able to take advantage of a global shortage of semiconductors and it is estimated that exports will grow by 9.6% in 2021, the strongest export growth since 2017. A Taiwanese company is the world's largest producer of semiconductors, and it plans to increase its capital investment by as much as US$28 billion in 2021 to help meet the shortage of semiconductors.
Consumption expenditure in Taiwan is also expected to grow by 3.7% in 2021 which would be the fastest rate of growth in 17 years.

","Taiwan’s economic growth in 2021 is driven by two key internal factors: increased capital investment and rising consumption expenditure. The first internal cause is the planned capital investment of US$28 billion by Taiwan’s largest semiconductor producer, aimed at expanding production capacity to address global semiconductor shortages. The second is the forecasted 3.7% growth in consumption expenditure, the fastest rate in 17 years, reflecting stronger domestic demand.  

Capital investment is more likely to generate long-term economic growth. This is because investment in semiconductor production enhances Taiwan’s productive capacity, fostering technological innovation and economies of scale. Such infrastructure improvements raise potential output, aligning with endogenous growth theory where capital accumulation drives sustainable growth. In contrast, consumption expenditure, while boosting short-term aggregate demand, relies on cyclical consumer confidence and disposable income, which may fluctuate. Sustained growth depends more on investment in productive capacity, making the US$28 billion capital injection a stronger foundation for Taiwan’s future economic resilience."

","The appreciation of the Taiwan dollar will influence the terms of trade, which measure the ratio of average export prices to average import prices. A stronger currency increases export prices in foreign markets and reduces import prices in domestic terms. For Taiwan’s semiconductor and electronics industries, which dominate exports, the appreciation may not significantly harm demand due to the global shortage of semiconductors and inelastic demand for these high-value goods. The article highlights that Taiwan’s export sales growth is forecast to rise to 9.6% in 2021, suggesting robust demand despite higher prices. This could improve terms of trade, as export revenue rises relative to import costs, particularly for industries reliant on imported raw materials, which become cheaper.  

However, industries outside the tech sector, such as traditional manufacturing or agriculture, may face reduced competitiveness. Their exports, which are less differentiated or price-sensitive, could decline as foreign buyers switch to cheaper alternatives. Similarly, domestic industries competing with imports, such as food production or retail, may struggle as cheaper imports undercut local prices. While the tech sector benefits from sustained demand and lower import costs for components, other sectors could experience falling export volumes and profit margins.  

Ultimately, the net effect depends on the price elasticity of demand for each industry’s exports and their reliance on imported inputs. The semiconductor industry’s dominance and global supply constraints likely insulate it from adverse effects, but less specialised industries may suffer. Therefore, the appreciation’s benefits are not universal, creating winners and losers across Taiwan’s economy."

","A higher rate of economic growth in Taiwan could yield significant benefits, particularly through increased employment and income levels. The extract highlights that Taiwan’s GDP growth is driven by surging export demand for semiconductors and electronics, with capital investment rising by US$28 billion. This expansion in production capacity is likely to create jobs in high-value manufacturing and technology sectors, reducing unemployment and raising household incomes. Higher incomes could improve living standards, as seen in the forecasted 3.7% growth in consumption expenditure—the fastest in 17 years—which may stimulate further economic activity through the multiplier effect. Additionally, the government could benefit from increased tax revenues, enabling greater public spending on infrastructure, education, or healthcare, as suggested by the trade surplus rising to US$63.9 billion. A stronger Taiwan dollar, appreciated by 7% against the US dollar, might also lower import costs, reducing inflationary pressures and increasing real incomes.

However, rapid growth poses risks. The reliance on semiconductor exports exposes Taiwan to global demand cyclicality—a downturn in tech sectors could destabilise growth. While current CPI growth remains moderate at 1.3%, prolonged high growth might overstretch resources, causing demand-pull inflation if aggregate demand outpaces productive capacity. Environmental degradation is another concern, as expanded industrial output could increase pollution and resource depletion, particularly in energy-intensive semiconductor fabrication. Furthermore, currency appreciation risks making non-tech exports less competitive, potentially harming other sectors. For instance, a stronger Taiwan dollar could reduce foreign demand for non-semiconductor goods, worsening trade imbalances if the tech sector’s dominance crowds out diversification.

Evaluating these consequences, Taiwan’s growth trajectory appears sustainable in the short term due to its strategic position in global semiconductor supply chains and prudent fiscal management evidenced by rising trade balances. The benefits of job creation and technological advancement likely outweigh inflationary or environmental risks, especially given the modest CPI forecast. However, long-term sustainability depends on diversifying the economic base and investing in green technologies to mitigate environmental costs. Thus, while higher growth is advantageous, proactive policy measures are essential to address structural vulnerabilities."
46,"Pakistan and the Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI)
The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.
Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.
Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.
The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).

","Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a method used to compare the economic productivity and living standards between countries by adjusting for differences in price levels. It involves calculating the exchange rate at which a specific basket of goods and services would cost the same amount in two different currencies. For example, if a basket of goods costs 10,000 Pakistani rupees in Pakistan and $100 in the United States, the PPP exchange rate would be 100 rupees per dollar, reflecting the relative purchasing power of each currency. This adjustment allows for more accurate international comparisons of metrics like GDP per capita, as it accounts for variations in local prices rather than relying solely on nominal exchange rates."

The BRI is a strategy initiated by China in 2013 that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and sea networks. Its aim is to improve regional integration, increase trade and stimulate economic growth. It involves major investment in infrastructure projects. Under the BRI China is looking for markets with growth potential for their exports, in particular openings for profitable infrastructure and industrial investment. Profits in China are falling and over-capacity is widespread.
Better direct transport links will encourage growth for China’s inland provinces, for example, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This is a US$50 billion road building scheme linking an inland province in western China to a newly developed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea. The development offers a shorter and cheaper route for China’s exports to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Additionally, the port development includes plans for investment in Pakistan’s railways and industrial zones.
Other projects are focused on energy supply including coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation and the development of Pakistan’s electricity grid. Pakistan’s economy is affected by power cuts which lead to many firms having their own inefficient diesel generators that increase their costs of production. The generators are also highly polluting. A more reliable electricity supply will also benefit households as cooking can be done without using unhealthy solid fuels, such as straw, and students can study for longer in the evening.
The construction machinery used for these infrastructure projects is supplied mainly by China and the projects are supervised by Chinese managers. To pay for these projects Pakistan takes loans provided by Chinese banks and institutions. Pakistan already has outstanding foreign debt of approximately 25% of gross domestic product (GDP).

","The Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI) is likely to impact both Pakistan’s potential and actual economic growth. Potential economic growth refers to the expansion of an economy’s productive capacity, illustrated by an outward shift of the production possibility curve (PPC) from PPC₁ to PPC₂. This occurs when the BRI’s infrastructure investments, such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), enhance Pakistan’s capital stock and technological efficiency. Improved transport networks, energy grids, and industrial zones reduce production costs and increase long-term productive potential. For instance, reliable electricity from BRI projects reduces firms’ reliance on costly diesel generators, raising productivity and shifting the PPC outward.  

Actual economic growth is the increase in real GDP, represented by a movement from a point inside the PPC (e.g., point A) to a point closer to or on the curve (e.g., point B). The BRI stimulates actual growth by boosting aggregate demand through job creation in construction and infrastructure sectors. Enhanced trade routes lower transport costs, increasing exports and attracting foreign investment. However, Pakistan’s reliance on Chinese loans risks debt sustainability, which could constrain future growth if repayment pressures divert resources from productive investment.  

In a PPC diagram, the horizontal axis could represent consumer goods and the vertical axis capital goods. Initially, Pakistan operates at point A inside PPC₁. BRI investments in infrastructure (capital goods) shift the PPC to PPC₂, while increased efficiency moves output toward point B on PPC₂, illustrating both potential and actual growth."

","The standard of living refers to the material and non-material well-being of a population, encompassing factors such as income, employment, income distribution, and access to goods and services. Table 1.1 indicates that between 2014 and 2018, China’s GDP per capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity) rose by 28%, from US$11,917 to US$15,243, while Pakistan’s increased by 14%, from US$4,171 to US$4,740. This suggests material living standards improved in both countries, though the rise was far more substantial in China. Unemployment rates also fell marginally in both nations: China’s declined from 4.1% to 3.8%, and Pakistan’s from 5.8% to 5.5%, which could imply better job opportunities and income security.  

However, income inequality trends differed. China’s Gini coefficient fell from 43.7 to 38.5, indicating a reduction in income inequality and a more equitable distribution of economic gains. In contrast, Pakistan’s Gini coefficient rose from 29.8 to 33.5, signalling worsening inequality, which may have partially offset the benefits of higher GDP per capita for lower-income groups. While material living standards likely improved in China due to stronger GDP growth and falling inequality, Pakistan’s rising inequality suggests the gains from economic growth were less evenly shared.  

Non-material aspects of living standards, such as environmental quality or access to public services, are not reflected in the data. For instance, Pakistan’s reliance on polluting diesel generators (mentioned in the extract) could undermine non-material well-being despite GDP growth. Similarly, China’s infrastructure investments under the BRI might improve logistics but could also entail environmental costs. Thus, while the table highlights material progress, particularly in China, it provides an incomplete picture of overall living standards."

","The Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI) is likely to have significant but contrasting long-term impacts on the economies of Pakistan and China, as evidenced by the article. For China, the BRI offers opportunities to address domestic economic challenges such as falling profits and industrial overcapacity. By investing in infrastructure projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China can export construction machinery, steel, and rail equipment, utilising its excess production capacity. This reduces idle resources and lowers average costs for Chinese firms, potentially restoring profitability. The development of the Gwadar port provides a cheaper export route to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, particularly benefiting China’s inland provinces by integrating them into global trade networks. Additionally, Chinese banks gain a profitable market for loans, as Pakistan borrows heavily to finance these projects. However, China faces risks if Pakistan struggles to repay its debts, which could destabilise Chinese financial institutions. Furthermore, reliance on coal-fired power plants in BRI projects may conflict with global environmental goals, damaging China’s international reputation.  

For Pakistan, the BRI promises transformative infrastructure investments. The CPEC’s road and port developments could enhance trade connectivity, while upgrades to railways and industrial zones may stimulate export-oriented growth. Investment in energy infrastructure, such as coal-fired and nuclear power plants, addresses chronic electricity shortages that force firms to rely on costly, polluting diesel generators. A stable electricity grid could lower production costs, improve industrial competitiveness, and raise household living standards—for instance, by reducing reliance on unhealthy solid fuels for cooking. Over time, this could boost human capital as students benefit from extended study hours. However, Pakistan’s foreign debt, already at 25% of GDP, risks becoming unsustainable if projected economic growth falters. The reliance on Chinese loans increases vulnerability to debt distress, with potential defaults straining fiscal stability. Moreover, the environmental costs of coal-based energy could exacerbate health issues and long-term climate liabilities. While the article highlights employment opportunities from infrastructure projects, the dominance of Chinese machinery and managers may limit local job creation, reducing the multiplier effect on Pakistan’s economy.  

Judging the long-term impacts, the BRI could yield net benefits for China by resolving overcapacity and securing trade routes, provided debt repayments are managed. For Pakistan, the initiative offers critical infrastructure but carries substantial debt and environmental risks. The success of the BRI hinges on Pakistan’s ability to convert infrastructure into productive assets that generate export revenue and economic diversification. Without this, the debt burden could outweigh gains, perpetuating dependency. Conversely, if managed prudently, the BRI might catalyse sustainable growth, narrowing the development gap between Pakistan and China. The article’s evidence suggests cautious optimism, though structural challenges in both economies necessitate careful risk mitigation."

",The article refers to concentration ratios. Explain what is meant by a concentration ratio and how it is calculated. [4],"a

The article refers to concentration ratios. Explain what is meant by a concentration ratio and how it is calculated.
The concentration ratio is the sum of the market share percentage held by the largest specified number of firms in an industry. It ranges from 0% to 100%, and an indicates the degree of competition in the industry. Low concentration ratio in an industry would indicate greater competition among the firms in that industry. (2)
It is calculated by adding together the total sales for each of the specified number of largest firms in the industry. (E.g. a 4 firm concentration ration takes the sales of the largest 4 firms) That sum is then divided by the total sales of the industry and converted to a percentage. (2)

4

","A concentration ratio measures the extent to which a market is dominated by a small number of large firms by calculating the combined market share of the top firms in an industry. It is expressed as a percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%, where a higher value indicates greater market concentration and less competition. For instance, a four-firm concentration ratio (CR4) of 80% means the largest four firms collectively control 80% of the market. This metric helps assess market structure, with low ratios suggesting competitive markets and high ratios implying oligopolistic or monopolistic tendencies.  

To calculate a concentration ratio, the total sales (or output) of the specified number of largest firms is summed and divided by the total sales of the entire industry, then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage. For example, if the three largest firms in an industry generate £150 million in sales and the industry’s total sales are £500 million, the three-firm concentration ratio (CR3) would be \( \frac{150}{500} \times 100 = 30\% \). This calculation highlights the relative dominance of key players, aligning with the article’s reference to industries with high concentration ratios despite competition laws aiming to regulate market power."

Explain, with an example, whether the article is correct in saying that neither the producer nor the consumer pays for negative externalities.
A negative externality is a cost that is incurred by a third party. (1) Negative externalities exist when individuals bear a portion of the cost associated with a good’s production without having had any influence over the related production decisions. (1)
Accept any relevant example of the effect of production on a third party. (1 for example, 1 for application).Maximum 3 marks if only consumption externality discussed.

","The article is correct in asserting that negative externalities often remain unpaid by producers or consumers, as these costs are typically borne by third parties. A negative externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good imposes costs on individuals or society not involved in the transaction. For instance, a coal-fired power station emitting pollutants creates health hazards (e.g., respiratory diseases) and environmental damage (e.g., acid rain) for nearby communities. The firm’s private costs (labour, machinery) do not include these external costs, and consumers paying for electricity do not compensate affected third parties. This creates a divergence between private and social costs, leading to overproduction in a free market (Qm > Qopt in a negative externality diagram). While Pigouvian taxes or regulations could internalise these costs, the article highlights that, in unregulated markets, the absence of such measures allows externalities to persist unpaid, justifying its claim."

it allows increased power to monopolies with resulting higher profits that benefit the shareholders and producer management not the consumer.
it results in unequal bargaining power between employers and workers. Workers have little scope for arguing for pay rises.
it allows an unequal negotiation between large organisations and small independent suppliers. Large organisations can insist on low purchasing prices and small suppliers have limited power to resist. This has been noticeable in large supermarkets dealings with small farmers.


4

","The article highlights two key reasons why increased industry concentration may not enhance consumer welfare beyond the issue of negative externalities. First, it argues that the relentless focus on low consumer prices creates a ""low price/low wage spiral"". Firms driven by profit maximisation push for cheaper goods and services, which often leads to suppressed wages for workers. While prices may fall, stagnant or declining real incomes reduce workers’ purchasing power, undermining their ability to benefit from lower prices. This imbalance in bargaining power between ""powerful employers and workers"" leaves employees with limited capacity to negotiate fair wages, ultimately diminishing overall consumer welfare despite superficially lower prices.

Second, concentrated markets enable ""unequal bargaining positions between powerful buyers and small independent suppliers"". Dominant firms, particularly in monopolised industries, can exploit their market power to impose unfavourable terms on smaller suppliers, such as demanding lower prices for inputs. For instance, the article implies that large supermarkets might pressure small farmers into accepting reduced payments, squeezing supplier margins. This dynamic harms the sustainability of smaller businesses and reduces diversity in supply chains, potentially leading to long-term market inefficiencies. Consumers may face reduced product quality or variety as suppliers struggle to meet cost demands, negating any short-term price benefits from concentrated markets."

The article says that monopolies are tolerated because they are efficient.
Assess, with the help of a diagram, whether economic theory supports the idea that monopolies are efficient.
Definition of efficiency:

Productive efficiency producing at the lowest cost for the particular output. (2)
Allocative efficiency where every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the marginal cost of producing it. (2)

Diagram should illustrate:Correctly drawn and labelled Monopoly diagram. (3marks)
Conclusion: the theory does not support this opinion. (1)

8


","Economic theory provides a nuanced perspective on whether monopolies are efficient, primarily analyzing static efficiency through productive and allocative efficiency. A monopoly, characterized by a single firm dominating the market with high barriers to entry, maximizes profit by producing where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). In the standard monopoly diagram, this output level (Qm) is lower than the socially optimal quantity (Qc) under perfect competition, while the price (Pm) is higher than both the competitive price (Pc) and the marginal cost (MC). This results in allocative inefficiency, as price exceeds marginal cost (P > MC), indicating that resources are under-allocated to the good, creating deadweight loss (DWL) – a welfare reduction shown by the triangle between Qm, Qc, and the demand curve. Productive efficiency is also absent, as monopolies do not necessarily produce at the minimum point of the average total cost (ATC) curve, unlike firms in perfect competition.  

However, monopolies may achieve dynamic efficiency due to supernormal profits (shown as the shaded area between Pm, ATC, and Qm in the diagram), which can fund research and development (R&D). For instance, the article notes that monopolies are “relied upon to justify innovation,” aligning with Schumpeter’s hypothesis that market power incentivizes technological progress. Yet, this does not negate static inefficiencies: the diagram’s DWL persists, and consumer surplus shrinks as prices rise. Furthermore, natural monopolies – where economies of scale make single-firm production most efficient – still require regulation to prevent exploitative pricing. Thus, while monopolies might foster innovation (dynamic efficiency), economic theory largely refutes the claim that they are statically efficient, as illustrated by the divergence between monopoly and competitive equilibria in the diagram. The article’s assertion that monopolies are tolerated for efficiency is only partially valid, depending on the type of efficiency prioritized."

Consumers love to eat doughnuts. In 2019, 10 billion of these deep-fried sugar-coated products were consumed in the United States (US). Fig. 1.1 shows that the US market increased steadily from 2011 to 2019. Doughnuts are widely available throughout the US. There are specialist shops selling their branded products almost everywhere; local coffee shops invariably sell ‘hole in one’ doughnuts as a popular breakfast snack to tempt consumers on their way to work. The growing number of shops selling doughnuts has been an important reason behind overall market growth.

Fig. 1.1 Doughnut market size in the US, 2011 to 2021 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a varying impact on the US doughnut market. Despite having less income, many consumers have continued to buy small luxuries such as doughnuts which remain affordable and can provide some short-term relief from the stresses of the pandemic. Overall, sales of doughnuts fell in 2020 and are forecast to remain below their 2019 peak into 2021. Reasons for this fall in demand are that consumers are making fewer shopping trips and in cities, more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack.
In the United Kingdom (UK), more so than in the US, there are growing concerns about the increase in sugar consumption amongst children. This increase comes from soft drinks, chocolate biscuits and sweets (candy) as well as from jam-filled doughnuts, all of which are widely available in supermarkets and local convenience stores. In 2021, it was estimated that a third of teenagers and two thirds of adults in the UK were overweight. This has increased the pressure on the UK government to end online advertising of a range of products including doughnuts. It has been estimated that viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories. Moreover, a ban on advertising sugary foods would result in children consuming the equivalent of 62 million fewer doughnuts a year in the UK.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a varying impact on the US doughnut market. Despite having less income, many consumers have continued to buy small luxuries such as doughnuts which remain affordable and can provide some short-term relief from the stresses of the pandemic. Overall, sales of doughnuts fell in 2020 and are forecast to remain below their 2019 peak into 2021. Reasons for this fall in demand are that consumers are making fewer shopping trips and in cities, more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack.
In the United Kingdom (UK), more so than in the US, there are growing concerns about the increase in sugar consumption amongst children. This increase comes from soft drinks, chocolate biscuits and sweets (candy) as well as from jam-filled doughnuts, all of which are widely available in supermarkets and local convenience stores. In 2021, it was estimated that a third of teenagers and two thirds of adults in the UK were overweight. This has increased the pressure on the UK government to end online advertising of a range of products including doughnuts. It has been estimated that viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories. Moreover, a ban on advertising sugary foods would result in children consuming the equivalent of 62 million fewer doughnuts a year in the UK.

","The US doughnut market contracted in 2020 because the COVID-19 pandemic led to more people working from home, reducing foot traffic in city centres where doughnuts are often purchased as snacks. With fewer commuters visiting coffee shops or specialist stores, demand fell sharply, as highlighted in the article: ""more people are working from home and therefore not buying their daily coffee and doughnut snack."" This decline in habitual purchases directly contributed to the market contraction."

Identification that it is Income inelastic (1)
Sales of doughnuts have increased to some consumers despite them having a fall in income (1)


2

","The demand for doughnuts in the US is income inelastic. This is evident from the article’s statement that ""despite having less income, many consumers have continued to buy small luxuries such as doughnuts"". Income inelastic demand occurs when a change in income leads to a proportionally smaller change in quantity demanded. Here, even during reduced incomes in the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for doughnuts remained relatively stable, as they were perceived as affordable indulgences. The fall in sales in 2020 was attributed to fewer shopping trips and remote work patterns, not income changes, further supporting the conclusion that doughnuts are income inelastic."

","A ban on online advertising for sugary foods in the UK would likely reduce demand for these products, as shown by a leftward shift of the demand curve from D1 to D2 in a standard demand and supply diagram. This occurs because advertising plays a role in shaping consumer preferences and increasing awareness of products. The article states that ""viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories,"" implying that advertising artificially inflates demand by creating positive perceptions of sugary foods. The leftward shift would result in a lower equilibrium price (from P1 to P2) and quantity (from Q1 to Q2), as producers adjust to reduced consumer interest.  

However, the extent of this shift depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for sugary foods. Since these products are often cheap and constitute a small proportion of income, demand may be price inelastic. This means the percentage fall in quantity demanded could be smaller than the percentage fall in price, limiting the effectiveness of the ban. Furthermore, the article highlights that sugary foods are ""widely available"" and consumed as ""small luxuries,"" suggesting habit-driven purchases that are less responsive to reduced advertising.  

The ban’s impact may also be diluted by substitution effects. For instance, manufacturers could switch to offline advertising channels, such as television or in-store promotions, to maintain sales. The article notes that sugary foods are sold in ""supermarkets and local convenience stores,"" which could exploit physical marketing strategies. Additionally, an informal market might emerge, particularly among teenagers, bypassing regulated advertising channels.  

In conclusion, while the demand curve would shift left initially, the actual reduction in consumption could be modest due to inelastic demand and substitution effects. The ban’s success would hinge on complementary policies, such as sugar taxes or health education, to amplify its impact."

","A ban on online adverts for sugary foods in the UK could have several effects on consumers and the government. For consumers, particularly children, reduced exposure to advertising may decrease the consumption of high-sugar products like doughnuts, as the article states that “viewing one minute of advertising for products like doughnuts leads to a child consuming an additional 14.2 calories”. This could lower obesity rates, improving long-term health outcomes and reducing pressure on the National Health Service (NHS), which currently treats obesity-related conditions. Healthier consumers might also enhance workforce productivity and educational attainment, as obesity can impair cognitive function and physical activity. However, the ban may limit consumer choice and awareness of new products, potentially reducing short-term utility for those who derive pleasure from sugary snacks. For the government, lower obesity rates could reduce healthcare costs, freeing up fiscal resources. Yet, tax revenues might decline if reduced advertising lowers sales of sugary goods, as firms in this sector contribute to VAT and corporate tax. Additionally, the government could face lobbying from affected industries, risking political friction. The effectiveness of the ban is uncertain, however, since other advertising channels (e.g., in-store promotions) and habitual consumption patterns—such as the “daily coffee and doughnut snack” mentioned in the article—may persist. Moreover, the ban’s success depends on complementary policies, like sugar taxes or health education, to reinforce behavioural change. Overall, while the ban may yield public health benefits, its economic and behavioural impacts are contingent on broader factors, suggesting a cautious but favourable assessment."

Nigeria has about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of young people in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic, particularly due to the steep decline in oil prices. Nationally, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, while another 25% are vulnerable and could fall into poverty due to the pandemic.
Oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria’s export revenues, a dominant position that it has occupied since the 1970s. Many people believe that Nigeria needs to move further away from its dependence on oil and natural gas. Initial attempts at diversification have produced limited gains as the policies have been aimed mainly at the domestic market to create jobs and to improve living standards. There needs to be a focus on export‑orientated manufacturing that should boost economic growth as it has done in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
Based on the experience of these countries, more open trade and competition policies would help to diversify the economy, especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) takes effect. Nigeria needs to create at least five million new jobs each year to employ its growing population of young people.

Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 2020 due to fall in crude oil prices caused by falling global demand and measures to fight the spread of COVID‑19. Inflation rose in 2020 due mainly to higher food prices, the removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in the price of electricity. The budget deficit also worsened in 2020 because the COVID‑19 pandemic caused higher government spending and lower tax revenues, adding to the national debt.
Nigeria’s national debt is sustainable at 25% of GDP, but interest payments are high, accounting for about 50% of government spending. Nigeria’s government could improve its finances by reforming domestic tax collection. Non‑oil tax revenue is equivalent to just 4% of GDP. An increase in the rate of value‑added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 resulted in less revenue than forecast because of the recession. A wider tax base could help the budget, but this will require significant reform to reduce both tax evasion and a large informal economy.

","A production possibility curve (PPC) illustrates the maximum potential output combinations of two goods or sectors an economy can produce with its available resources and technology. In Nigeria’s case, rising unemployment represents underutilised labour resources, shifting the economy from a point on the PPC (full employment) to a point inside the curve (unemployment). For example, if the axes represent oil/non-oil output, unemployment reduces productive capacity, moving the economy inward (e.g., from point A on the curve to point B inside it), indicating inefficiency and lost output potential.

",Consider the extent to which the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria would lead to an increase in inflation. [4] ,"c

Consider the extent to which the removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria would lead to an increase in inflation.

For an explanation of why the removal of subsidies is likely to lead to an increase in the price of fuel e.g., by increasing the cost of producing and / or supplying fuel or by shifting the supply curve to the left to its original position. (1)
For an explanation of why this is likely to lead to an increase in inflation / a rise in the price level e.g., fuel will have a high weighting in the measurement of inflation / PED is likely to be inelastic/ it is an important cost of production that affects the price of many other products / it may lead to cost-push inflation. (1)
For an explanation of why this may lead to continuing inflation e.g., as price rises, wage demands fuel further inflation / may lead to an increase in the price level for a much wider range of products. (1)

For some evaluation of the overall impact e.g., the inflationary impact may be offset by the fact that: (1)

there is a reduction in other costs/prices OR
PED may in fact be elastic leading to a fall in demand and therefore prices rise but at a lower rate OR
It also may depend on the size of the original subsidy.

Accept any other valid reason why the inflationary impact may be offset.

4

","The removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria is likely to lead to an increase in inflation due to its direct and indirect effects on production costs and consumer prices. Fuel subsidies artificially lower the price of petrol and diesel, which are critical inputs for transportation, electricity generation, and manufacturing. When subsidies are removed, fuel prices rise, shifting the supply curve for fuel to the left (from S1 to S2) and increasing the equilibrium price. This directly contributes to inflation, as fuel has a high weighting in Nigeria’s Consumer Price Index (CPI). For example, the article states that inflation rose to 12.8% in 2020 partly due to the removal of fuel subsidies, highlighting this causal link.  

The inflationary impact is compounded by cost-push inflation mechanisms. Higher fuel costs raise transportation and production expenses across industries, increasing the prices of goods and services. Since fuel demand is price inelastic in the short term (PED < 1), consumers cannot easily reduce consumption, leading to sustained price rises. Furthermore, wage-price spirals may occur if workers demand higher wages to offset rising living costs, perpetuating inflationary pressures.  

However, the extent of inflation depends on mitigating factors. If the government reallocates subsidy savings to productive investments or social programs, it could stimulate aggregate supply, offsetting some inflationary pressures. Additionally, if global oil prices fall concurrently, the domestic fuel price rise might be less severe. The article notes that Nigeria’s 2020 VAT increase yielded less revenue than expected due to recessionary conditions, suggesting weak consumer demand could dampen inflationary effects. Nevertheless, given Nigeria’s reliance on fuel and its inelastic demand, the removal of subsidies is likely to result in significant, though not entirely unrestrained, inflationary pressure."
63,"Is Nigeria being held back by its dependence on oil and gas?
Nigeria has about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of young people in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.
Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic, particularly due to the steep decline in oil prices. Nationally, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, while another 25% are vulnerable and could fall into poverty due to the pandemic.
Oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria’s export revenues, a dominant position that it has occupied since the 1970s. Many people believe that Nigeria needs to move further away from its dependence on oil and natural gas. Initial attempts at diversification have produced limited gains as the policies have been aimed mainly at the domestic market to create jobs and to improve living standards. There needs to be a focus on export‑orientated manufacturing that should boost economic growth as it has done in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
Based on the experience of these countries, more open trade and competition policies would help to diversify the economy, especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) takes effect. Nigeria needs to create at least five million new jobs each year to employ its growing population of young people.

Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 2020 due to fall in crude oil prices caused by falling global demand and measures to fight the spread of COVID‑19. Inflation rose in 2020 due mainly to higher food prices, the removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in the price of electricity. The budget deficit also worsened in 2020 because the COVID‑19 pandemic caused higher government spending and lower tax revenues, adding to the national debt.
Nigeria’s national debt is sustainable at 25% of GDP, but interest payments are high, accounting for about 50% of government spending. Nigeria’s government could improve its finances by reforming domestic tax collection. Non‑oil tax revenue is equivalent to just 4% of GDP. An increase in the rate of value‑added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 resulted in less revenue than forecast because of the recession. A wider tax base could help the budget, but this will require significant reform to reduce both tax evasion and a large informal economy.

","To assess whether supply-side policy is the best way to diversify Nigeria’s economy away from oil and gas, it is necessary to evaluate how such policies could address structural weaknesses while considering their limitations. Supply-side policies aim to improve productivity and competitiveness, which are critical for developing non-oil sectors like manufacturing. For instance, investing in infrastructure, such as reliable electricity and transport networks, would reduce production costs for businesses, enabling them to compete in export markets. This aligns with the article’s emphasis on export-oriented manufacturing, as seen in Malaysia and Indonesia. Additionally, education and training programs could address skill shortages, creating a workforce suited for industries beyond oil, such as technology or agro-processing. Deregulation to simplify business creation and tax reforms to broaden the tax base (as highlighted by Nigeria’s 4% non-oil tax revenue-to-GDP ratio) might incentivise entrepreneurship and formalise the informal economy, fostering diversification.  

However, supply-side policies face significant challenges in Nigeria’s context. High inflation (12.8% in 2020) and a large budget deficit (–5.2% of GDP) limit the government’s ability to fund infrastructure or education projects. The dominance of oil revenues also creates a “resource curse,” where political focus and investment remain skewed toward oil, undermining diversification efforts. Furthermore, supply-side reforms often take years to yield results, whereas Nigeria’s unemployment rate (9% in 2020) and need for “five million new jobs annually” demand quicker solutions. For example, while improving tax collection could fund public investments, the article notes that VAT increases during the recession failed to raise expected revenue, illustrating implementation risks.  

Alternative approaches, such as demand-side policies, could complement supply-side measures. Fiscal stimulus targeting labour-intensive sectors might create immediate jobs, but Nigeria’s high debt service costs (50% of government spending) constrain this. Trade policies under the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) could boost export diversification by opening regional markets, but this requires competitive industries—a gap supply-side policies aim to fill. Protectionist measures for infant industries might shield emerging sectors but could conflict with ACFTA’s free trade principles.  

Ultimately, supply-side policies are necessary but insufficient alone. Their success depends on parallel institutional reforms to curb tax evasion and corruption, alongside strategic trade policies. While they address long-term structural barriers, short-term job creation may require targeted interventions. Therefore, a hybrid approach combining supply-side reforms with export-oriented trade strategies is likely more effective than relying solely on supply-side measures."

","To assess whether adjusting direct or indirect tax collection would more effectively increase tax revenue in Nigeria, it is necessary to evaluate the structural challenges highlighted in the article. Nigeria’s tax revenue from non-oil sources is only 4% of GDP, with a large informal economy and widespread tax evasion. Adjusting indirect taxes, such as VAT, may seem straightforward, as they are levied on consumption and easier to administer at the point of sale. However, the article notes that increasing VAT from 5% to 7.5% in 2020 yielded less revenue than expected due to the recession, which reduced consumer spending. Additionally, the informal sector, where transactions often go unrecorded, limits VAT effectiveness, as evasion is rampant. Higher indirect taxes could also exacerbate inflation (already at 12.8% in 2020) and disproportionately affect low-income households, reducing disposable income and worsening poverty.

In contrast, improving direct tax collection—such as income or corporate taxes—could address systemic issues. Nigeria’s informal economy means many individuals and businesses evade direct taxes. Reforming tax administration to broaden the tax base, formalize informal sectors, and reduce evasion could create a more sustainable revenue stream. For instance, progressive income taxes targeting higher earners in the formal sector might raise revenue without immediately affecting the poor. However, this requires significant institutional capacity to track incomes and enforce compliance, which Nigeria currently lacks. Furthermore, corporate tax reliance on the volatile oil sector (80% of export revenue) underscores the need to diversify the tax base towards non-oil sectors. While direct tax reform is challenging, it addresses root causes of low revenue, such as informality and evasion, offering long-term gains.

Evaluation suggests indirect taxes face immediate hurdles like inflation and informality, while direct taxes, though administratively demanding, target structural weaknesses. Given Nigeria’s high poverty (40%) and unemployment (9%), over-reliance on regressive indirect taxes risks deepening inequality. Therefore, prioritizing direct tax reforms to enhance compliance and formalization, despite short-term difficulties, is likely more effective for sustainable revenue growth."

","Measuring unemployment in India presents several challenges. Firstly, disguised unemployment is prevalent, particularly in the agricultural sector, where workers may appear employed but contribute minimally to output. For instance, the article notes that farming acts as a ""last resort"" for many unemployed individuals, yet in December 2020, agriculture shed 9.8 million jobs, highlighting how seasonal variations complicate distinguishing between productive and unproductive labour. Secondly, frictional unemployment arises due to information gaps and geographical immobility, as workers are ""unaware of job vacancies"" or ""reluctant to relocate"", making it difficult to capture transient job-seeking behaviour in surveys. Thirdly, India's vast informal economy means many workers engage in unreported or irregular employment, such as street vending or casual labour, which official statistics may classify as unemployed despite actual economic activity. Finally, discouraged workers who abandon job searches after prolonged unemployment are excluded from unemployment figures, understating true labour market slack. While these issues are significant, measurement efforts by institutions like CMIE still provide valuable insights, albeit with inherent limitations in capturing the full complexity of India's labour dynamics."

","Seasonal unemployment occurs when workers are unemployed at certain times of the year due to fluctuations in demand tied to seasonal industries, such as agriculture. In India, the article highlights that December 2020 saw 9.8 million job losses in agriculture, as farming requires fewer workers during this period. This type of unemployment is structural and recurring, disproportionately affecting rural populations reliant on seasonal income. Given India’s heavy dependence on agriculture—a sector employing nearly half its workforce—seasonal unemployment can exacerbate poverty and underemployment, as workers lack alternative income sources during off-seasons. This creates persistent income instability, particularly in regions with limited economic diversification.  

Frictional unemployment arises from temporary transitions between jobs, often due to information gaps or mobility barriers. The article notes that India’s labour force grew by 6 million in December 2020, with many new entrants struggling to find work due to reluctance to relocate or unawareness of vacancies. While frictional unemployment is typically short-term, geographical and occupational immobility can prolong job searches, stifling labour market efficiency. For instance, workers may lack skills for emerging sectors or resist moving to urban areas, hindering reallocation of labour to growing industries. However, frictional unemployment is less severe in the long term if policies improve job-matching systems or vocational training.  

Seasonal unemployment is likely more serious for India’s economy due to its scale and cyclical impact. The loss of 9.8 million agricultural jobs in a single month reflects systemic vulnerability in a sector central to livelihoods. This not only deepens poverty but also limits aggregate demand, stifling broader economic growth. In contrast, while frictional unemployment highlights structural inefficiencies, its transient nature and smaller relative scale (6 million new entrants) make it more addressable through targeted interventions. Nevertheless, persistent frictional unemployment amid economic recovery signals underlying labour market rigidities that could hinder long-term productivity. Overall, seasonal unemployment’s recurring, large-scale disruption to a critical sector renders it a more pressing challenge for India’s economy."

","To address unemployment in a country like India, a combination of fiscal, monetary, and supply-side policies could be considered, each with distinct mechanisms and challenges. Fiscal policy measures, such as increased government spending on infrastructure projects, could directly create jobs in construction and related sectors, while tax cuts might stimulate consumer demand and business investment, leading to higher labour demand. However, given India’s public sector debt constraints—highlighted by the borrowing surge during the 2020 recession—excessive fiscal expansion risks worsening debt sustainability. Monetary policy, through interest rate reductions, could lower borrowing costs for firms, encouraging investment and expansion. Yet, with interest rates already low in many economies, the scope for further cuts may be limited, and such measures may not effectively target structural issues like seasonal unemployment in agriculture.  

Supply-side policies are critical for addressing India’s specific challenges. Enhancing labour market flexibility through improved job-matching platforms could reduce frictional unemployment by connecting new entrants to vacancies, as cited in the article’s reference to workers’ reluctance to relocate or unawareness of opportunities. Training programmes targeting skills for emerging sectors like technology or manufacturing could shift labour away from agriculture, mitigating seasonal unemployment. Additionally, incentivising private investment in non-agricultural sectors through tax breaks or subsidies could diversify employment opportunities. However, these policies require long-term implementation and may face barriers such as inadequate funding or resistance to labour market reforms.  

Evaluation-wise, the fluctuating unemployment rate (6.5% to 11.9%) underscores the need for both immediate and sustained measures. Fiscal and monetary tools offer quicker relief but may exacerbate inflation or debt if overused. Supply-side reforms, while slower, address root causes like skills mismatches and sectoral dependence. Regional disparities in India further complicate policy effectiveness—urban areas may benefit from infrastructure projects, while rural regions require agricultural modernisation or SME support. Moreover, cultural factors, such as mobility reluctance, may persist despite policy efforts. Thus, a balanced approach, tailored to India’s dual unemployment drivers and regional diversity, is essential, though success hinges on coherent implementation and political will."

","A recession is a significant decline in economic activity across an economy, typically measured by a sustained period of negative growth in gross domestic product (GDP). GDP represents the total value of goods and services produced, and a recession occurs when this output contracts for two consecutive quarters. This contraction reflects reduced consumer spending, investment, and employment, leading to lower income levels and economic hardship."

Analyse why governments borrow and why it is said that a government should increase spending in a recession.
Governments borrow to finance government expenditure not covered by receipts or taxation (2) Government borrows to finance a deficit (1)
Borrowing would be used to increase government spending/ AMD (1) this would increase income (1) output (1) employment (1) and through the multiplier (1) encourage economic growth (1)

","Governments borrow primarily to finance expenditures that exceed their current revenue from taxes and other income sources, addressing budget deficits. During a recession, borrowing becomes a critical tool for fiscal policy. When economic activity contracts, tax revenues fall due to lower incomes and profits, while expenditures on welfare programs like unemployment benefits rise. To avoid deepening the recession through austerity measures, governments borrow to maintain or increase spending. This approach aligns with Keynesian economics, which advocates counter-cyclical fiscal policies: boosting aggregate demand (AD) through government spending during downturns to offset reduced private sector demand. For instance, the UK’s fivefold increase in borrowing in June 2020, as noted in the article, aimed to fund initiatives that stimulate AD, such as infrastructure projects or income support, which raise household income and consumption. Higher consumption increases demand for goods and services, prompting firms to expand output and hire workers, reducing unemployment. This process is amplified by the multiplier effect, where each unit of government spending generates more than one unit of economic growth as recipients of income spend a portion of it, creating further rounds of demand. In contrast, raising taxes to fund spending during a recession would reduce disposable income, worsening the downturn. Thus, borrowing enables governments to stabilise the economy without compromising recovery, as emphasised by the UK Finance Minister’s focus on maintaining debt-to-GDP stability rather than immediate deficit reduction."

",Consider what is meant by the phrase 'government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector.' [6],"c

Consider what is meant by the phrase 'government borrowing could 'crowd out' the private sector.
'Crowding out' idea is that the growth of government spending will lead to a transfer of scarce resources, or finance, from the private to the public sector. (2)
If the government borrows to fund the expenditure it may have to sell bonds to the private sector (1). Encouraging the private sector to buy bonds may require higher interest rates (1) or prevent the private sector using the money for other projects. A rise in interest rates will also make private borrowing more expensive (1) and crowds-out private investment and consumption (1)

6

","The term 'crowding out' refers to the phenomenon where increased government borrowing reduces the availability of financial resources for the private sector, leading to higher interest rates and suppressed private investment and consumption. When the government borrows to finance its spending—such as through selling bonds to the private sector—it competes for the same pool of loanable funds in financial markets. This heightened demand for funds drives up interest rates, as lenders require higher returns to compensate for the perceived risk of lending to the government, particularly when public debt levels are high. 

Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for businesses and households, discouraging private investment in capital projects and reducing consumer spending on credit-dependent purchases like housing or durable goods. This transfer of scarce financial resources from the private to the public sector can stifle economic dynamism, as private firms may delay or cancel investments that would otherwise drive growth and innovation. The crowding-out effect is most pronounced when the economy operates near full capacity, with low unemployment and limited spare resources. In such conditions, additional government borrowing exacerbates competition for funds, whereas in a recession with underutilised resources, crowding out is less likely, as idle savings can absorb higher borrowing without significant interest rate spikes. The mechanism underscores the trade-off between fiscal stimulus and long-term private sector vitality."

Sound because – the economy is in recession so there would be no crowding out (1)
the position could be worse if spending were reduced, and government revenue would be affected further (1)

Japan doesn’t have a problem (1) but that economy is different (1)
borrowing may increase interest rates; this would affect the rest of the economy. High interest rates would discourage investment (1)

Conclusion: Evidence is inconclusive. (1)

6


","The article presents both supporting and conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of high government borrowing, leaving the case inconclusive. On one hand, borrowing during a recession aligns with Keynesian theory, as governments can inject demand through fiscal stimulus when private sector activity contracts. The UK’s decision to borrow heavily in 2020 aimed to counteract falling output and unemployment, with the Finance Minister emphasising that stabilising the debt-to-GDP ratio matters more than absolute debt levels. This is supported by Japan’s experience, where a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200% has not triggered crises, suggesting high borrowing can be sustainable under certain conditions, such as low interest rates and domestic investor confidence. Additionally, the article notes that crowding out is unlikely during recessions due to idle resources, meaning higher public borrowing does not displace private investment when the economy operates below capacity.  

However, counterarguments weaken the conclusiveness. Rising debt risks higher interest rates if investors perceive bonds as riskier, increasing borrowing costs for both government and private firms. While Japan’s case offers reassurance, structural differences—such as Japan’s high domestic savings rate and central bank policies—limit its applicability to the UK. The article also highlights that the UK’s debt ratio (99.6%) was the highest in 60 years, raising concerns about long-term sustainability, particularly if growth remains sluggish. Reducing borrowing too soon could stifle recovery, but maintaining high deficits might destabilise the debt ratio if GDP growth underperforms. Furthermore, economists’ uncertainty about borrowing limits introduces ambiguity, as outcomes depend on unpredictable factors like investor sentiment and future growth.  

Ultimately, the evidence is mixed. While borrowing in 2020 addressed immediate recessionary risks and Japan’s example provides a precedent, the article does not conclusively prove effectiveness. Risks such as interest rate hikes, structural economic differences, and the absence of a universal debt threshold undermine certainty. The policy’s success hinges on context-specific variables, leaving the case for high borrowing persuasive but not definitive."
74,"Loyalty and consumer behaviour
Consumer loyalty can be shown in different ways. It may be through:

customer reward schemes (e.g. loyalty cards) that offer discounts based on the amount spent with a specific retailer
emotional loyalty where customers prefer a particular brand that they always buy
monopoly loyalty where there is no alternative to the retailer or brand.

Supermarkets try to attract customers by using loyalty cards that give promotions and price reductions to those who have a card. The cards also help the supermarket build barriers between retailers to gain a marketing advantage. 
When consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands. However, sometimes the discounts used by the scheme may be confusing and make it difficult for the consumer to compare prices. 
There are risks for the retailers too. The loyalty cards require substantial investment to run – one supermarket put the cost at US$60m a year. These costs could well result in higher prices for the consumer.
But how do loyalty card schemes fit into the context of the way in which consumers make choices? A research report found that in one country where 70% of consumers had a loyalty card, only about 10% were loyal to one particular card.
It has been found that when choosing to buy groceries consumers look for one-stop shopping (43%), good service (22%), price (18%), the availability of a coffee shop (12%) and help with packing (6%). Loyalty cards come below these. 
Companies use loyalty cards to gather data on customers and their buying preferences. They then direct future offers to consumer wishes in specific promotions both online and in the mail. Loyalty schemes are thus sometimes less about loyalty and more about understanding customers’ wants.
The economic model of consumer behaviour using indifference curves assumes that consumers conduct research and buy products and services in a rational way. Many purchases, however, are based on habit and consumer research is imprecise. When the consumer has a low involvement in research or a low emotional attachment to the product, there will be little loyalty.

Firstly, loyalty cards create barriers to competition by reducing consumer switching between brands, as highlighted by the concern that ""when consumers are collecting points towards a particular goal, the loyalty card may hinder free competition and prevent switching between brands."" This reduces contestability, a feature of imperfect markets, by tying consumers to specific retailers. Secondly, the high fixed costs of operating loyalty schemes—such as the ""$60m a year"" cost cited for one supermarket—act as a barrier to entry for smaller firms, entrenching the market power of larger retailers. Thirdly, the article suggests these costs ""could well result in higher prices for the consumer,"" indicating potential price distortions characteristic of imperfect competition. Finally, the ""confusing"" nature of discounts linked to loyalty cards creates information asymmetry, as consumers find it ""difficult to compare prices,"" undermining the perfect knowledge assumption required for perfectly competitive markets.

Explain why a profit-maximising retailer might be interested in the link between consumers’ loyalty and price elasticity of demand.

Loyalty will mean consumers do not change suppliers, this might create a lower price elasticity of demand. (1)
Define price elasticity. (1)
Explain the link between elasticity and revenue (1); explain the link between changes in revenue and profits, depending on cost changes. (1)


4

","A profit-maximising retailer would be interested in the link between consumer loyalty and price elasticity of demand because loyalty reduces consumers’ responsiveness to price changes, making demand more inelastic. Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the percentage change in quantity demanded relative to a percentage change in price. When consumers are loyal to a brand or retailer—whether through emotional attachment, habit, or schemes like loyalty cards—they are less likely to switch to competitors even if prices rise. This lower PED allows the retailer to increase prices without suffering a significant drop in sales, thereby raising total revenue. For instance, the article notes that loyalty cards aim to “build barriers between retailers,” suggesting they reduce substitutability, a key determinant of elasticity. With inelastic demand, marginal revenue remains positive over a wider range of output, enabling the firm to maximise profits by setting prices where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. However, the cost of maintaining loyalty schemes, such as the $60 million annual expense cited, must be weighed against these revenue gains. If the higher prices funded by loyalty schemes do not disproportionately raise costs, profits will increase. Thus, fostering loyalty aligns with profit maximisation by creating pricing power through reduced elasticity."

Evidence from the article for the effectiveness of using loyalty cards:

retailers recognise the importance of price and can offer discounts through loyalty cards. (1)

In contrast to that the article says:

price is not the most significant factor in determining choice (1)
there is no loyalty if buying is based on habit or has low emotional involvement. (1)

Conclusion: there does seem to be some conflicting evidence. (1)

5

","The article presents conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of loyalty cards offering price discounts. On one hand, loyalty cards are shown to enhance retailers’ ability to target consumers through data collection. The article states that companies use loyalty cards “to gather data on customers and their buying preferences”, enabling them to “direct future offers to consumer wishes” via tailored promotions. This suggests that price discounts linked to loyalty schemes could improve consumer engagement and sales by aligning offers with individual preferences. Additionally, retailers “recognise the importance of price” and use loyalty cards to offer discounts, implying that such schemes may attract price-sensitive consumers.  

However, the article also highlights limitations. Research indicates that price ranks third (18%) among factors influencing consumer choice, behind one-stop shopping (43%) and good service (22%). This implies that price discounts via loyalty cards may have a weaker impact on purchasing decisions than retailers assume. Furthermore, the article notes that “only about 10% [of consumers] were loyal to one particular card”, despite 70% holding loyalty cards. This low loyalty rate suggests that price discounts alone fail to secure long-term consumer commitment, particularly when purchases are habitual or lack emotional attachment. The article’s reference to the economic model of consumer behaviour reinforces this, as “low involvement in research” or “low emotional attachment” reduces loyalty, diminishing the effectiveness of price-based incentives.  

In conclusion, while loyalty cards offer retailers tools for targeted discounts and data-driven marketing, the evidence conflicts over their effectiveness. Price discounts are less influential than other factors in consumer choice, and habitual purchasing patterns limit the ability of such schemes to foster genuine loyalty."

","The indifference curve theory of consumer behaviour fundamentally relies on the assumption of rationality, which underpins how consumers make choices to maximise their utility. Rationality in this context means consumers have consistent, well-ordered preferences and make decisions based on perfect information to achieve the highest possible satisfaction within their budget constraints. 

Central to this theory is the idea that consumers can rank all combinations of goods through indifference curves, each representing bundles that provide equal utility. A rational consumer is assumed to know precisely which combinations they are indifferent between, maintaining transitive preferences (e.g., if Bundle A is preferred to Bundle B, and Bundle B to Bundle C, then A is preferred to C). This consistency ensures that indifference curves do not intersect, reflecting logical and stable decision-making. Furthermore, consumers are modelled to compare the marginal utility per unit of price for different goods, allocating their income to reach the tangency point between their budget line and the highest attainable indifference curve. At this point, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) equals the price ratio, illustrating a rational equilibrium where no reallocation could increase satisfaction.

The theory also presumes consumers act without uncertainty, possessing complete knowledge of prices, product qualities, and their own preferences. For instance, a rational consumer would not choose a bundle on a lower indifference curve if a higher one is affordable, as this would contradict utility maximisation. However, this assumption contrasts with real-world behaviour highlighted in the article, where purchases are often habitual or based on imperfect research, leading to ""low emotional attachment"" and limited loyalty. The indifference curve framework excludes such irrationalities, instead presenting an idealised scenario where consumers systematically evaluate trade-offs, such as sacrificing units of one good to gain more of another while maintaining constant utility. While this rational model provides a foundational understanding of consumer choice, its limitations become evident when compared to empirical behaviours like impulsive buying or brand inertia, which deviate from the theory’s rigidly logical framework."
78,"Vietnam's 'Economic Miracle'
Thirty years ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. Since then, its real GDP has increased rapidly. A series of economic and political reforms has been responsible for its so-called 'economic miracle'. 
Vietnam has benefitted from the increased protectionism in trade between China and the United States (US). For example, Vietnam has increased production of goods that are substitutes to those made in China to such an extent that Vietnam is popularly referred to as 'China plus one', in recognition of its similar comparative advantage to China. 
Rising export revenue is only one reason for Vietnam's spectacular economic growth. With a rapidly growing population, Vietnam has invested heavily in its human capital and physical capital in the form of infrastructure, including cheap access to the internet. 
A third reason for this success is how Vietnam has moved towards trade liberalisation. This is shown through its free trade agreement with the US and its membership of organisations of countries that have agreed to trade freely with each other, such as ASEAN and the TPP. These initiatives involve the removal of tariffs and other tools of protection, increasing the potential for Vietnam to trade with other countries.
Nevertheless, there are possible dangers in this strategy. Vietnam's economy is heavily dependent on its exports which in 2017 were over 90% of GDP. This reliance puts Vietnam at risk from downturns in the global economy and in the economies of its main trading partners. Even more worrying is the repeated threat from the US that it may put import tariffs on manufactured goods from Vietnam.

79,"Vietnam's 'Economic Miracle'
Thirty years ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. Since then, its real GDP has increased rapidly. A series of economic and political reforms has been responsible for its so-called 'economic miracle'. 
Vietnam has benefitted from the increased protectionism in trade between China and the United States (US). For example, Vietnam has increased production of goods that are substitutes to those made in China to such an extent that Vietnam is popularly referred to as 'China plus one', in recognition of its similar comparative advantage to China. 
Rising export revenue is only one reason for Vietnam's spectacular economic growth. With a rapidly growing population, Vietnam has invested heavily in its human capital and physical capital in the form of infrastructure, including cheap access to the internet. 
A third reason for this success is how Vietnam has moved towards trade liberalisation. This is shown through its free trade agreement with the US and its membership of organisations of countries that have agreed to trade freely with each other, such as ASEAN and the TPP. These initiatives involve the removal of tariffs and other tools of protection, increasing the potential for Vietnam to trade with other countries.
Nevertheless, there are possible dangers in this strategy. Vietnam's economy is heavily dependent on its exports which in 2017 were over 90% of GDP. This reliance puts Vietnam at risk from downturns in the global economy and in the economies of its main trading partners. Even more worrying is the repeated threat from the US that it may put import tariffs on manufactured goods from Vietnam.

Explain the relationship you would expect between the annual change in the balance of trade in goods and services and the annual change in real GDP growth.

A positive relationship might be expected. (1)
Exports are a component of AD so rising exports lead to faster economic growth. (1)


2

","A positive relationship is expected between improvements in the balance of trade and real GDP growth. This is because net exports (exports minus imports) are a component of aggregate demand (AD), calculated as \( AD = C + I + G + (X - M) \). When the balance of trade in goods and services improves—such as moving from a deficit (–188,557 billion dong in 2009) to a surplus (+140,282 billion dong in 2017)—net exports rise, directly increasing AD. This stimulates economic growth, as seen in Vietnam’s real GDP growth rising from 5.4% in 2009 to 6.8% in 2017. However, short-term fluctuations (e.g., GDP growth dipping to 5.3% in 2012 despite a surplus) may reflect other factors like investment or consumption changes."

Conversely, in 2017, the largest trade surplus (+140,282 billion dong) coincided with a relatively high GDP growth rate of 6.8%, suggesting some link between trade performance and growth. However, this pattern is inconsistent, as seen in 2015 when growth rose to 6.7% despite a much smaller surplus (+33,169 billion dong). While there is limited evidence of higher surpluses correlating with higher growth in certain years (e.g., 2014 and 2017), the overall data lacks a clear, direct relationship, and potential time lags or external factors may further obscure causality."

6

","The appreciation of the Vietnamese dong due to increased export demand is likely to have mixed macroeconomic effects. A stronger dong arises because higher export revenues increase foreign demand for the currency, shifting the exchange rate upwards. This appreciation makes Vietnamese exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing export competitiveness over time. For instance, if the dong strengthens significantly, Vietnam’s export-led growth model—where exports constituted over 90% of GDP in 2017—could face challenges, as seen in the threat of US tariffs on manufactured goods. Reduced export volumes might lower aggregate demand, slowing GDP growth and employment in export-oriented industries such as manufacturing, which has driven Vietnam’s ""economic miracle."" Conversely, cheaper imports due to a stronger dong could lower input costs for firms reliant on foreign materials, supporting domestic production and consumer spending, thereby partially offsetting declines in export sectors.  

Additionally, a stronger currency could dampen inflationary pressures by reducing the price of imported goods, improving living standards. However, this might also harm domestic producers competing with cheaper imports, leading to structural unemployment in vulnerable industries. The trade balance, initially bolstered by rising exports, could deteriorate if appreciation persists, as seen in the fluctuating trade surpluses from 2009–2018 (e.g., falling from +140,282 billion dong in 2017 to unknown in 2018). Yet, Vietnam’s heavy investment in human and physical capital, as noted in the extract, may enhance productivity, mitigating some negative impacts by maintaining cost competitiveness.  

Ultimately, the net effect depends on the magnitude of exchange rate pressure and policy responses. While short-term benefits like lower inflation and import costs are probable, long-term risks to export-driven growth and employment highlight the need for diversification, as over-reliance on exports leaves Vietnam vulnerable to external shocks. Thus, while appreciation reflects economic success, its sustainability hinges on balancing export competitiveness with structural reforms to strengthen domestic demand."

6


","Vietnam’s ‘economic miracle’ may persist due to several structural advantages. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China position Vietnam as a substitute exporter under the ‘China plus one’ strategy, leveraging its comparative advantage in low-cost manufacturing. This has already driven export-led growth, with real GDP rising consistently (e.g., 7.1% in 2018) and trade surpluses expanding (e.g., +140,282 billion dong in 2017). Trade liberalisation through agreements like the TPP and ASEAN reduces tariffs, enhancing access to global markets and attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Additionally, heavy investment in human capital and infrastructure, such as affordable internet, boosts productivity and supports long-term growth by improving labour quality and technological adoption. Rising domestic consumption, spurred by higher incomes from GDP growth, could further diversify the economy away from pure export reliance.  

However, significant risks threaten this trajectory. Vietnam’s export dependency (90% of GDP in 2017) leaves it vulnerable to external shocks, such as a global recession reducing demand for manufactured goods. The US has repeatedly threatened tariffs on Vietnamese exports, which could erode price competitiveness and deter FDI. Crowding out by MNCs relocating to lower-cost countries could occur if Vietnam’s wage costs rise or geopolitical risks intensify. The economy’s reliance on external markets contrasts with Japan’s debt-driven model cited in the extract, which is less export-dependent. A downturn in key partners like the US or China could sharply reduce export revenue, destabilising growth.  

Evaluating these factors, the sustainability of Vietnam’s growth hinges on balancing external risks with domestic reforms. While diversification into human capital and infrastructure may mitigate some export dependency, the immediate threat of protectionism (e.g., US tariffs) or a global slump could overwhelm these efforts. Vietnam’s proactive trade agreements and cost advantages suggest resilience, but its narrow economic base remains a critical weakness. Without stronger domestic demand or reduced export reliance, the ‘miracle’ remains precarious, particularly if global trade dynamics worsen. Thus, while growth is likely to continue in the short term, its persistence over the next decade depends on structural diversification and stable international conditions."
84,"The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil
Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland. 
Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt. 
Nations producing palm oil view it as a means of reducing poverty, while international finance organisations regard it as an engine of growth for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) encouraged Malaysia and Indonesia to cultivate natural resources and to produce more palm oil in spite of an awareness of high external costs. Dutch banks provided more than US$12 billion in loans to Indonesian producers. Palm oil is Indonesia’s main export earner. 
Widespread adoption of palm oil began when, in 1995, one of the world's major multinational companies decided to use it in its global food manufacturing industries instead of animal fats and other vegetable oils, which were then said to be unhealthy. It invested heavily in expanding palm oil plantations in Malaysia and achieved considerable cost savings because palm oil has a much higher yield per hectare than other vegetable oils.
Palm oil's versatility is not limited to food. It is used in 70% of personal care products (toiletries) such as soap, shampoo and make-up. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel fuel.
As the palm oil industry expanded, conservationists began to raise the alarm about the devastating effects from carbon emissions and on wildlife habitats. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of some rare animals. 
In 2019, one supermarket promised to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. Norway banned imports for biodiesel production. The European Parliament proposed that public subsidies for biodiesel should be removed by 2021. If this proposal is enacted it will affect the demand for biodiesel and may force palm oil producing countries to reduce deforestation programmes, leading to improved environmental sustainability.

","Developing countries that produce palm oil view it as a means of poverty reduction because it generates significant income and employment opportunities, particularly in rural economies where underemployment and low wages are prevalent. The extract highlights that palm oil production has ""raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia,"" where 85% of global output originates. This aligns with the agricultural sector’s role in absorbing surplus labour, as palm oil plantations provide stable employment compared to seasonal farming, directly increasing household earnings and living standards. Additionally, high global demand for palm oil — driven by its use in food, toiletries, and biodiesel — makes it a critical export commodity. For instance, palm oil is Indonesia’s ""main export earner,"" earning foreign exchange (forex) that strengthens the balance of payments, as seen after the 1998 crisis when declining manufactured exports led to external debt. By prioritising palm oil, these nations leverage comparative advantage in natural resources to stimulate economic growth, supported by foreign investment such as the ""US$12 billion in loans from Dutch banks."" This investment expands plantations, creating multiplier effects in local economies through infrastructure development and ancillary industries. Consequently, sustained demand and export revenues translate into poverty reduction by raising incomes and diversifying rural livelihoods."

","The European Parliament’s proposal to remove public subsidies for biodiesel by 2021 represents a contractionary fiscal policy that could significantly reduce demand for palm oil in the biodiesel market. Subsidies lower the price of biodiesel, making it more affordable for consumers. Removing these subsidies would raise biodiesel prices in Europe, leading to a contraction in demand due to the price elasticity of demand. Since palm oil is a key input in biodiesel production, this would reduce imports of palm oil by European countries. For Malaysia and Indonesia, which collectively produce 85% of global palm oil and rely on it as a major export—particularly Indonesia, where it is the ""main export earner""—this would decrease export revenues. A fall in exports would worsen their balance of payments, potentially leading to current account deficits and external debt pressures, as seen during the 1998 crisis when export declines caused economic strain.  

Lower demand for palm oil would also depress incomes in rural areas where production is concentrated, exacerbating poverty and reducing employment in plantations and processing industries. The extract highlights that palm oil production has raised rural incomes and acted as an ""engine of growth,"" so reduced demand could reverse these gains, increasing unemployment and lowering household consumption. Furthermore, multinational companies, such as the Dutch banks that provided ""$12 billion in loans"" to Indonesian producers, might scale back investments if profitability declines, reducing capital inflows and limiting future growth. This chain of effects illustrates how fiscal policy changes in one region can create negative multiplier effects across global supply chains, disproportionately impacting developing economies dependent on commodity exports."
87,"The Hidden Cost of Palm Oil
Worldwide production of palm oil has been increasing for many years. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled. The amount of land taken to produce palm oil is vast. It accounts for 10% of all global cropland. 
Over 3 billion people in 150 countries now use products containing palm oil. The worldwide demand has raised incomes, especially in the rural areas of Malaysia and Indonesia that produce 85% of the output of palm oil. After the global economic crisis of 1998, the region had been suffering from a significant decline in the exports of manufactured goods. This had a detrimental effect on the balance of payments and resulted in external debt. 
Nations producing palm oil view it as a means of reducing poverty, while international finance organisations regard it as an engine of growth for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) encouraged Malaysia and Indonesia to cultivate natural resources and to produce more palm oil in spite of an awareness of high external costs. Dutch banks provided more than US$12 billion in loans to Indonesian producers. Palm oil is Indonesia’s main export earner.

To what extent do you agree with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to encourage Indonesia to expand its production of palm oil?
In support of the advice: Indonesia was suffering from external debt problems and the IMF advocated expansion of a big earner of forex to eliminate this debt with positive outcomes for growth of incomes in-country. Plus any relevant positive effects identified. (4 max)
The disadvantage was the devastation of rain forests to increase land area for oil palms. Fires increase greenhouse gas emissions (global warming) and destroy habitats. External costs will exceed private costs of plantation owners. Danger of monoculture – prices influenced by foreign buyers – could result in job losses eventually if foreign trade is reduced. (4 max)
Conclusion: Although Europe may reduce its demand, increasing demands in India, China and Indonesia will be critical. Palm oil can be seen as both a positive benefit and a negative impact with a high social cost. Environmentally production is unsustainable at present rate of expansion. [1] (8 max total)

","The advice of the IMF to encourage Indonesia to expand palm oil production presents a complex trade-off between economic growth and environmental sustainability. On one hand, palm oil has been a critical driver of Indonesia’s economic recovery and development. Following the 1998 global economic crisis, the country faced significant external debt and a deteriorating balance of payments due to declining manufactured exports. Expanding palm oil production, which accounts for 85% of global output alongside Malaysia, provided a viable solution. By focusing on this natural resource, Indonesia leveraged its comparative advantage, boosting export earnings and attracting substantial foreign investment, such as the US$12 billion in loans from Dutch banks. This aligns with export-led growth strategies, where increasing exports of a high-demand commodity improves the current account balance, reduces external debt, and raises incomes in rural areas—key for poverty reduction. The versatility of palm oil, used in food, personal care products, and biodiesel, ensured diversified demand, enhancing economic stability. Multinational corporations further entrenched its viability by shifting to palm oil for cost efficiency, given its high yield per hectare compared to alternatives.  

However, the environmental and social costs undermine the long-term sustainability of this strategy. The expansion of palm oil plantations has led to extensive deforestation, with fires used to clear land contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change. This represents a negative externality, where the private costs borne by producers (e.g., land clearance) are far lower than the social costs (e.g., biodiversity loss, habitat destruction for endangered species like orangutans, and global warming impacts). Market failure arises as these external costs are not priced into production, leading to overproduction relative to the socially optimal level. Additionally, reliance on palm oil creates risks of monoculture, where overdependence on a single export leaves Indonesia vulnerable to price volatility and demand shifts, such as the EU’s proposed removal of biodiesel subsidies or consumer boycotts. Norway’s import ban and supermarket pledges to eliminate palm oil illustrate such demand-side risks, which could destabilize export revenues and employment in the sector.  

While the IMF’s advice was justified in the immediate post-crisis context to restore economic stability, the long-term implications are contentious. The environmental degradation threatens global ecological balance, and the economic benefits may diminish if sustainable alternatives reduce palm oil demand. However, growing markets in India and China could offset declines in Western demand, prolonging reliance on palm oil. A balanced approach is essential: Indonesia could adopt stricter environmental regulations, invest in sustainable practices like certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO), and diversify its economy to mitigate monoculture risks. Thus, while the IMF’s advice catalysed short-term growth, its long-term viability hinges on addressing externalities and transitioning toward environmentally sustainable and economically diversified frameworks."

Romania, like other former planned economies in eastern Europe has increased the amount of private enterprise and foreign direct investment (FDI) in its economy. Romania's economy has boomed in recent years and compares favourably with economies in the European Union (EU) as indicated in Fig. 1.1.

This economic boom has been characterised by the expansion of services and manufacturing sectors. In particular the high-tech industries have been very successful and are expected to double their contribution to GDP to 12% by 2025. The low wage rate in Romania was a benefit for foreign companies. For example, global car companies have, since 2008, invested US$1.4 billion in Romania’s car factories that has increased employment. 
After Romania joined the EU in 2007, many Romanian workers took advantage of the free movement of labour the EU allows. In 2008, 600000 out of a population of 21.2m left Romania. In spite of its economic boom, Romania has failed to attract sufficient workers back and there is now a shortage of labour. The total population is lower than in 2008 at 19.4m. Unemployment was only 5.9% in 2017 compared with an average rate of 8.6% for the EU as a whole. 
Since 2015, the government has taken measures to boost the economy. It reduced sales tax from 24% to 19%, which increased consumer demand. It also doubled the national minimum wage providing a boost for both private sector and public sector employment. 
But there are also serious economic challenges. The gap between government income and spending has widened causing a rising budget deficit. The transport infrastructure remains poor. In a World Economic Forum report in 2016, Romania was ranked 128th out of 138 countries for the quality of its road network and 79th for its railway system.

","Romania's rapid economic growth can be attributed to several factors outlined in the article. Firstly, the expansion of high-tech industries and manufacturing sectors, particularly through foreign direct investment (FDI), has been significant. Global car companies, for example, invested US$1.4 billion in Romanian factories, drawn by the country’s low wage rates, which reduced production costs and increased employment opportunities. This FDI likely triggered a multiplier effect, where initial job creation in the automotive sector stimulated further economic activity through higher incomes and demand for related goods and services. Additionally, government policies such as reducing sales tax from 24% to 19% boosted consumer demand by lowering prices, incentivising household spending and private consumption. The doubling of the national minimum wage further supported this by raising disposable income, stimulating both private and public sector employment. These combined factors—foreign investment in high-tech industries, cost advantages attracting multinational firms, and expansionary fiscal policies—collectively drove Romania’s economic growth."

Describe the changes in Romanian's workforce mentioned and consider whether they have been a benefit to Romania.
In 2008, 600 000 left to seek work in higher income countries in the EU. Trend continues to deplete labour force creating shortages in Romania as the economy expands. Total population still lower today than 2008 as migrants fail to return due to lower wage levels.

(1) Benefit: Cost to Romania may be offset partly by greater productivity in high tech and manufacturing. (1) Benefit: Also possible repatriation of funds from economic migrants.(1) Benefit: Lower welfare payments/greater tax revenue. (1m) Cost: Economic migrants have failed to return to overcome labour shortages. (1) Cost: Wage rates still relatively low (1)

","The extract highlights significant changes in Romania’s workforce following its EU membership in 2007. A key development was the emigration of 600,000 workers in 2008, driven by the opportunity to seek higher wages in other EU countries through free labour movement. This trend has persisted, contributing to a decline in Romania’s population from 21.2 million to 19.4 million and creating labour shortages despite the economy’s expansion. Unemployment fell to 5.9% in 2017, below the EU average of 8.6%, reflecting tighter labour markets. In response, the government doubled the national minimum wage to incentivise retention and attract workers, alongside reducing sales tax to stimulate demand.  

The workforce changes present both benefits and costs. On one hand, emigration reduced welfare dependency and increased remittances, potentially boosting household incomes and aggregate demand. Higher minimum wages improved living standards for low-skilled workers, while labour shortages may have driven productivity gains in high-tech and manufacturing sectors, evidenced by FDI inflows like the US$1.4 billion in car factories creating jobs. Lower unemployment also suggests efficient labour utilisation, reducing idle resources. However, persistent emigration exacerbated labour shortages, constraining growth in sectors like manufacturing and services. Despite wage increases, Romanian wages remain relatively low compared to EU averages, failing to entice sufficient return migration. This shortage risks inflationary wage spirals and undermines long-term growth, particularly given poor infrastructure ranked 128th globally for roads, which could deter further FDI.  

While higher wages and remittances offer short-term benefits, the structural labour deficit and population decline pose significant challenges. Without addressing wage competitiveness and infrastructure weaknesses, Romania’s capacity to sustain its economic boom may be limited, suggesting the workforce changes yield mixed outcomes overall."

The information states that Romania had a budget deficit. Explain what is meant by a budget deficit and discuss whether the measures taken by the government in 2015 were likely to reduce this deficit.
Explanation of the term (2)Reduced taxes would be no help initially but extra spending may increase revenue in longer term. Depends on elasticity of demand for products. Likely to reduce deficit. (3)Minimum wage may increase spending; government doesn’t have to pay for the increased wage in private industry. But they do have to pay for minimum wage in public sector. Increased income/consumer spending raises tax revenue. In the short run this would be likely to increase the deficit. In the long run the change in deficit is more uncertain. (2)

7


","A budget deficit occurs when a government’s expenditures exceed its tax revenues and other income over a fiscal year. This shortfall necessitates borrowing to finance the gap, increasing public sector debt. In Romania’s case, the deficit widened due to the imbalance between government income and spending. The government’s 2015 measures—reducing sales tax from 24% to 19% and doubling the national minimum wage—aimed to stimulate economic activity, but their impact on the deficit is ambiguous. Reducing sales tax lowers immediate tax revenue, potentially worsening the deficit in the short term. However, if the tax cut boosts consumer demand (as stated in the article), it could increase output and employment, raising income tax receipts and corporate tax revenues over time. This depends on the price elasticity of demand for taxed goods: if demand is elastic, higher sales volumes may offset lower tax rates, improving revenue. 

The minimum wage hike could have mixed effects. In the private sector, higher wages increase disposable income, potentially driving consumer spending and indirect tax revenues. However, firms facing higher labour costs may reduce hiring or raise prices, dampening employment and demand. For the public sector, the government directly bears the cost of higher wages, increasing expenditure and exacerbating the deficit. While the article notes that unemployment fell to 5.9%, labour shortages due to emigration limit the workforce’s expansion, constraining output growth and tax base improvements. 

Over the long term, these measures might reduce the deficit if economic growth—stimulated by higher demand and wages—generates sufficient tax revenue to offset initial losses. However, the immediate effect of lower sales tax revenue and higher public sector wage costs likely worsened the deficit initially. Without complementary policies to address structural issues like poor infrastructure (ranked 128th for roads), productivity gains may be limited, weakening the long-term fiscal impact. Thus, while the measures could support deficit reduction indirectly via growth, their short-term effectiveness is questionable, and success hinges on broader economic conditions."

As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

Explain how the lower level of subsidy currently paid to Pakistan's farmers is likely to affect Pakistan's trade in agricultural goods when competing with India in international markets.
It is likely to make exports of Pakistan's agricultural products less price competitive / imports of India's agricultural products more price competitive (1) and the resulting reduction in exports (1) and increasing imports (1) is likely to lead to a (increased) deficit in Pakistan's trade in agricultural goods (1)

Responses may consider the following points within the explanation:

Pakistan is already at a cost disadvantage when trading with India
Pakistan's agricultural exports are likely to be less competitive than similar exports from India
Lower subsidies exaggerate the cost differences
Could mean that imports of staple foods from India increase
Other countries will buy more goods from India due to cost difference



","The lower level of subsidies in Pakistan raises domestic production costs relative to India, as shown in Table 1.1, where Pakistan’s costs for staples like wheat (76 vs. 51 rupees) and rice (124 vs. 68 rupees) are significantly higher. This cost disparity reduces the price competitiveness of Pakistan’s agricultural exports in international markets, as Indian goods can be sold at lower prices due to their higher subsidies. Consequently, Pakistan’s exports of agricultural goods are likely to decrease, while imports of cheaper Indian products may rise. This imbalance would widen Pakistan’s trade deficit in agricultural goods, exacerbating its current account challenges."

As in most developing countries, the agricultural sector in Pakistan is heavily dependent on subsidies. Agriculture is an important activity, employing 45% of the population. Domestic production is vital in providing food for its growing population. Farming in Pakistan is not very profitable and without subsidies, many farmers would be forced to leave their farms.
Despite subsidies, as shown in Table 1.1, the cost of production in Pakistan is much greater for a range of staple products than it is in India where farmers are more heavily subsidised.

A sales tax increases the price of fertilisers to farmers in Pakistan. This can be shown by a shift to the left of the supply curve.
The effect on the market is likely to depend upon the PED for fertilisers and the size of the sales tax.


","A sales tax on fertilisers increases the cost of production for suppliers, causing the supply curve to shift leftward from S1 to S2 in the fertiliser market. This is because the tax raises the marginal cost of supplying each unit, effectively reducing the quantity suppliers are willing to offer at any given price. In the diagram, the vertical distance between S1 and S2 represents the per-unit tax burden. The new equilibrium price rises from P1 to P2, while the equilibrium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2. The extent of the price increase and quantity reduction depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for fertilisers. Since fertilisers are a necessity for agricultural production, demand is likely price inelastic (PED < 1), meaning the tax burden falls disproportionately on farmers, as seen in the larger rise in price (P1 to P2) compared to the smaller decrease in quantity. This aligns with the article’s mention of farmer complaints about GST increasing costs, as the tax raises input prices, reducing profitability. If PED were elastic, the quantity demanded would fall more sharply, but given farming’s reliance on fertilisers, the inelastic case is more relevant, leaving farmers with limited alternatives despite higher prices."

Various possibilities include:

Income support through transfer payments
Advice on how to cut costs and improve crop yields
Cheap finance to buy better quality seed
Policy of protectionism (N.B. do not accept 2 policies of protection as 2 separate ways)
Education and training



","The government could implement minimum support prices for key crops such as wheat or cotton. By guaranteeing a stable price floor, farmers are shielded from market price volatility, ensuring predictable revenue even during periods of oversupply or falling global prices. This reduces income uncertainty, incentivizes continued production, and prevents farm closures, which is critical in a sector employing 45% of Pakistan’s population. For instance, a minimum price for rice would allow farmers to invest in higher-quality seeds or irrigation systems without fearing financial loss, thereby improving long-term productivity.  

Another approach is providing subsidized access to agricultural training and technology. Government-funded extension services could educate farmers on cost-effective techniques, such as precision farming or drought-resistant crop varieties, directly addressing the high production costs highlighted in Table 1.1. Improved knowledge would raise yields per hectare, lowering average costs and enhancing competitiveness against Indian farmers. For example, training in efficient fertilizer use could reduce input waste, aligning with farmers’ complaints about GST on fertilisers, and indirectly lowering production expenses without direct tax cuts."

",Discuss whether agricultural subsidies should not be paid to farmers in countries which have lower opportunity costs in other areas of production. [6],"e

Discuss whether agricultural subsidies should not be paid to farmers in countries which have lower opportunity costs in other areas of production.
For an explanation of the benefits of paying agricultural subsidies to farmers (up to 3 marks)
For an evaluation of whether agricultural subsidies should be paid to farmers if the country already has lower opportunity costs in other industries. (Up to 3 marks with 1 mark reserved for a conclusion)

6
The answer should consider the benefits of subsidies to farmers in terms of increasing their incomes and benefits to the economy in terms of reducing import dependence and keeping the prices of staple goods affordable. The evaluation should consider these benefits in countries that have lower opportunity costs in other areas of production e.g., may be an unnecessary burden on government expenditure, may invite retaliation, may restrict trade etc.


","Agricultural subsidies can be justified in countries with lower opportunity costs in other areas of production if they address critical socio-economic objectives. Subsidies support farmers’ incomes, maintain employment in sectors like agriculture (which employs 45% of Pakistan’s population), and ensure food security by stabilising domestic production. This is vital in developing economies where reliance on food imports could worsen trade deficits and expose the population to global price volatility. For instance, Pakistan’s higher production costs for staples such as wheat and rice (Table 1.1) mean subsidies may prevent farm closures, safeguarding food access for its growing population. However, if a country has comparative advantages in non-agricultural sectors—such as manufacturing or services—subsidising agriculture could misallocate resources. Redirecting funds to industries with lower opportunity costs might enhance overall economic efficiency, as per David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. For example, if Pakistan’s opportunity cost of producing textiles is lower than India’s, prioritising textile exports over subsidising inefficient agriculture could improve trade balances and GDP growth.  

Yet, abandoning agricultural subsidies risks destabilising rural economies and increasing unemployment, particularly where alternative industries cannot absorb displaced labour. Additionally, food security concerns may justify subsidies despite inefficiencies, as over-reliance on imports creates vulnerability to supply shocks. Pakistan’s farmers argue that neighbouring countries’ subsidies distort global markets, disadvantaging developing nations. However, maintaining subsidies in such contexts may strain government finances, especially when fiscal space is limited—evident in Pakistan’s reluctance to increase subsidies despite farmer demands. Furthermore, persistent subsidies could disincentivise innovation, as farmers rely on state support rather than improving productivity.  

In conclusion, while subsidies may be economically inefficient in countries with lower opportunity costs elsewhere, they can be socially and politically necessary to prevent food insecurity and unemployment. The decision hinges on balancing short-term welfare needs against long-term structural reforms to enhance agricultural competitiveness or transition resources to more efficient sectors. For Pakistan, gradual subsidy reduction paired with investments in technology and infrastructure might align economic efficiency with socio-economic stability."

","One change in a factor of demand that could lead to rising maize prices in Malawi despite increased domestic production is a significant increase in consumer income. If maize is a normal good, higher household incomes would shift the demand curve to the right, as consumers purchase more maize at every price level. Even with greater domestic supply from increased production, a surge in demand—driven by rising incomes—could outpace the supply expansion, creating a shortage and exerting upward pressure on prices. This aligns with the basic demand-supply model: if the rightward shift in demand exceeds the rightward shift in supply, the equilibrium price rises. For instance, improved economic conditions in Malawi might boost disposable incomes, leading to higher consumption of maize-based products, thereby driving up its price despite greater output."

With reference to extract 2 explain two reasons why maize prices are rising in Zimbabwe despite the fall in the world export price of maize.
For identification of a reason (1 mark) and for explanation of how this will cause prices of maize to rise (1 mark)

4

Extract 2 states that the two reasons are 'sustained weakness in Zimbabwe's currency' and the 'sharply reduced harvest'. These need to be identified and explained. Only accept valid reasons contained in extract 2 that explicitly refer to Zimbabwe. The explanation should develop into why this reason will cause the price of maize to rise in Zimbabwe.
Relevant diagrams should only be rewarded if used as part of the explanation.


","The rise in maize prices in Zimbabwe despite falling world prices can be attributed to two key factors outlined in Extract 2. First, the sustained weakness of Zimbabwe’s currency has reduced its purchasing power in international markets. A depreciating currency means that importing maize requires exchanging more Zimbabwean dollars for foreign currency (e.g., US dollars), increasing the domestic cost of imported maize. Even if global maize prices fall, this exchange rate effect offsets the benefit, limiting imports and constraining domestic supply, which drives up local prices due to scarcity.  

Second, the ""sharply reduced harvest"" in Zimbabwe has directly decreased domestic maize production. Table 1.1 shows a forecasted 54.3% decline in Zimbabwe’s maize output from 2019 to 2020, reducing supply from 1.7 million tonnes to 777,000 tonnes. With lower domestic production, reliance on imports increases, but currency weakness exacerbates the shortage. This creates excess demand relative to supply, leading to price rises as consumers compete for limited maize stocks. Together, these factors—currency depreciation and supply shortages—explain the divergence between falling global prices and rising domestic prices in Zimbabwe."

","A rise in the minimum price of maize in Malawi can be illustrated using a supply and demand diagram. In this diagram, the original equilibrium price (P1) and quantity (Q1) occur where the supply curve (S) intersects the demand curve (D). When the government raises the guaranteed minimum price to a higher level (Pmin) above the equilibrium, it creates a horizontal price floor. At this higher price, farmers are incentivised to increase production due to the prospect of greater revenue per unit, leading to an extension along the supply curve from Q1 to Q2. This reflects the law of supply: higher prices encourage producers to supply more maize. However, the quantity demanded contracts to Q3 at Pmin, creating a surplus (Q2–Q3). The diagram demonstrates that the policy directly stimulates production by offering farmers a guaranteed price that exceeds market equilibrium, thereby shifting resources towards maize cultivation."

For an accurately labelled diagram that shows the shift to the right of the supply curve and the fall in equilibrium price that benefits the consumer (1 mark) and the rise in price received by the producer (plus 1 mark) and for an evaluative comment that refers to and accurately explains the significance of at least one measure of elasticity on the benefit to the producer and / or the consumer. (1 mark) and reaches a justified conclusion that benefit may / may not be enjoyed equally. (1 mark)

The diagram should show a shift to the right of the supply curve and a fall in pricebenefitting consumers and the payment to producers shown as the vertical distance between the new supply curve and the old supply curve at the new price. For both marks for the diagram, the impact on the price paid by the consumer and the effective price received by the producer must be clearly shown.
The answer just requires a brief explanation that the extent of the benefit to producers and consumers depends mainly on PED e.g. if it is elastic then producers will gain more and if inelastic, consumers will. May also depend on PES and consumers gain more when PES is more elastic and vice versa.
Justified conclusion needed for final mark


","A subsidy on maize production can be illustrated using a supply and demand diagram. The subsidy shifts the supply curve rightward from \( S_1 \) to \( S_2 \), reducing the equilibrium price from \( P_1 \) to \( P_2 \) for consumers and increasing the effective price received by producers to \( P_2 + \text{subsidy} \). Producers benefit directly from the subsidy, as their revenue per unit rises by the subsidy amount. However, the extent to which poorer households benefit depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for maize. If demand is inelastic—likely for a staple food like maize—the price decrease from \( P_1 \) to \( P_2 \) is minimal, limiting consumer gains. In Zimbabwe’s case, where maize production is forecast to fall by 54% (Table 1.1), supply constraints may render PES inelastic, further dampening the price reduction. Consequently, producers gain significantly from the subsidy, while poorer households experience limited price relief. Additionally, the government’s provision of subsidised maize to poorer households (Extract 2) may offer separate benefits, but the production subsidy itself disproportionately advantages producers. Thus, the benefits are unequal, favouring producers more than consumers under inelastic conditions."

Extract 1: World export prices of maize fall sharply
Export prices of maize declined further in April 2020, with the United States (US) maize price nearly 10% down from April 2019. It is now at the lowest value in more than ten years. Large global supplies and good harvest prospects in South America continue to reduce prices. In addition, lower demand for maize from the biofuel and animal feed industries is depressing the price further.
Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 12/05/2020
Extract 2: Zimbabwe takes steps to curb the rise in maize prices
Despite a falling world price for maize, the price of this staple food in Zimbabwe has continued to increase and is now at an exceptionally high level. The increased price mostly results from continued weakness in Zimbabwe’s currency that has damaged the country’s ability to import maize. In addition, the sharply reduced harvest of maize in Zimbabwe resulted in low domestic supplies. In an effort to tackle the soaring prices, the government has implemented several policies. To increase market supplies, the government removed a ban on imports of certain types of maize. It also increased producer subsidies on maize by 40%. Poorer households should benefit from access to this subsidised maize.

Extract 3: Malawi raises guaranteed minimum price for maize 
Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture has released updated guaranteed prices for cereals produced on Malawi's farms in 2020. These are the minimum prices that farmers will receive for their crops. The guaranteed price for the food staple, maize, was raised by just over 10%. The government has begun purchasing maize at this increased price. This change in the minimum price is expected to increase the production of maize in 2020 and in the future to an average level of 3.7 million tonnes per year.

The imposition of the maximum price will lead to a shortage of maize in the market. In the absence of equilibrium price another method of distributing maize will need to be found. This might lead to queuing, first come first served or illegal markets. A rationing system might alleviate the problems.
Although a diagram is likely to be used, this is not a requirement of the question and marks cannot be allocated specifically. The use of a diagram if accurate and correctly explained may be used in the explanation and rewarded accordingly.



","The effectiveness of maximum prices on staple foods like maize in Zimbabwe depends on their ability to address shortages while maintaining affordability for poorer households. A maximum price set below the equilibrium price would reduce the market price, making maize more affordable. However, this creates excess demand, leading to shortages as the quantity supplied falls (producers may cut output due to lower revenue) while quantity demanded rises. In Zimbabwe, where maize production fell by 54.3% in 2020 (Table 1.1), such shortages could worsen, forcing reliance on rationing or black markets, which disproportionately harm poorer households unable to compete in informal markets.  

The government’s removal of maize import bans (Extract 2) could mitigate shortages by increasing supply, but Zimbabwe’s weak currency raises import costs, limiting this solution. Additionally, producer subsidies (raised by 40%) may incentivise supply despite the price ceiling, but these require significant fiscal resources, risking inefficiency or corruption.  

Maximum prices could succeed if paired with robust supply-side measures, such as subsidised imports or direct state distribution to poor households. However, without addressing structural issues like currency instability and low domestic productivity, shortages and black markets may persist. Thus, while maximum prices aim to improve access, their effectiveness is contingent on complementary policies to stabilise supply and distribution, which remain challenging in Zimbabwe’s economic context."

Governments generally impose price controls for one of three reasons:

to redistribute income in an economy: maximum prices help the poor afford the necessities of life, whereas minimum prices support the livelihoods of farmers
to stabilise a market: governments use stocks to smooth fluctuations in the price of a commodity like cocoa, buying when there is excess supply in the market and selling when there is excess demand
to control inflation: maximum prices have been used in many countries

Many economists have been critical of the use of price controls by governments. In a market without government intervention, a product's price acts as a signal of its scarcity and an incentive to overcome scarcity. However, minimum prices can lead to food rotting in warehouses while maximum prices can lead to hoarding and black markets. 
Another reason not to impose price controls in an economy is that they can be very unpopular. For example, in Santiago, the capital city of Chile, an increase in the minimum price on the public transport system led to widespread unrest in 2019. In the same year, the government of Iran decided to raise the minimum price of fuel sharply and suddenly, leading to a great deal of protest.

","A product's price acts as a signal of its scarcity by reflecting the balance between supply and demand in a free market. When a product becomes scarce—due to limited supply or rising demand—its price increases, signaling to consumers that the resource is in short supply and encouraging them to ration their use or seek alternatives. Simultaneously, the higher price incentivises producers to allocate more resources towards increasing production, as the potential for greater profits motivates them to address the scarcity. This dual role of price ensures efficient resource allocation, guiding both consumption and production decisions in response to relative scarcity."

Possible reasons could include:

the need to reduce the demand for fuel; an increase in the price could be effective if the PED for fuel is elastic
this could benefit the country's current account on the balance of payments if a substantial amount of fuel is imported, although Iran does have a large amount of crude oil reserves
this will encourage producers to increase the supply of fuel which will help them to increase their profits
an increase in producer profits could lead to a substantial increase in government revenue from the taxes on profits
if subsidies have been reduced, the money saved could be reallocated



","The Government of Iran may have raised the minimum price of fuel in 2019 to reduce costly subsidies and reallocate public spending. Fuel subsidies impose a significant fiscal burden, as artificially low prices require the government to compensate producers for the difference between production costs and controlled retail prices. By increasing the minimum price, the government could reduce subsidy expenditure, freeing funds for alternative public investments such as healthcare or infrastructure. This aligns with economic reforms aimed at fiscal sustainability, particularly in an economy reliant on volatile oil revenues. However, abrupt subsidy cuts risk public backlash, as seen in the protests following Iran’s price hike, since low-income households disproportionately rely on subsidised fuel for transportation and heating."

","An effective minimum price in the market for rice in Haiti would be set above the equilibrium price, creating a surplus. In a standard supply and demand diagram, the equilibrium occurs where the downward-sloping demand curve intersects the upward-sloping supply curve. A horizontal minimum price line drawn above this equilibrium point would result in a higher price (Pmin) than the market-clearing price (Pe). At Pmin, the quantity supplied (Qs) by farmers exceeds the quantity demanded (Qd) by consumers, creating excess supply equal to Qs – Qd. This surplus, as noted in the article, risks food “rotting in warehouses” if the government does not purchase or store the excess. While the policy aims to support farmers’ incomes by guaranteeing higher prices, it distorts market signals: the artificially high price encourages overproduction despite insufficient consumer demand. Over time, this could lead to inefficiencies, such as misallocation of resources toward rice farming, and potential long-term dependency on government intervention to manage surpluses. The diagram illustrates the deadweight loss from the reduction in traded quantity from Qe to Qd, representing welfare loss to society."

Government action might help the workings of the price mechanism:

it can help to stabilise a market
stocks can be used to smooth fluctuations in the price of commodity, such as cocoa, avoiding/reducing large price variations
a government could buy stocks when there was an excess supply of a product in the market
a government could sell stocks when there was an excess demand for a product in the market

Government action might not help the workings of the price mechanism:

it could distort the market by not allowing prices to reflect changes in the conditions of demand for, and supply of, a product
the consideration of how such action by a government might not help the workings of the price mechanism can be discussed in relation to the different functions of the price mechanism, i.e. rationing, signalling and the transmission of preferences



","Government action to smooth price fluctuations can both support and hinder the price mechanism, depending on the context and implementation. On one hand, stabilising prices through stock management can reduce extreme volatility, which may improve market efficiency. For example, if a government buys cocoa during periods of excess supply (when prices would otherwise collapse due to low demand), it prevents producer revenues from falling unsustainably, protecting farmers’ incomes and maintaining incentives for future production. Similarly, selling stocks during shortages (when prices would spike) ensures continued affordability for consumers, preventing rationing solely through higher prices. This aligns with the article’s assertion that such interventions aim to “stabilise a market”, avoiding disruptive swings that could deter investment or cause social unrest. By moderating extreme price movements, governments may preserve the price mechanism’s signalling function over the longer term, as producers and consumers face fewer destabilising shocks.  

However, this intervention can distort the price mechanism’s core functions. Prices act as signals of scarcity: a rising price incentivises producers to increase supply and consumers to reduce demand, while a falling price does the opposite. If governments artificially stabilise prices, these signals are weakened. For instance, cocoa farmers might not reduce production during a global surplus if government purchases prevent price falls, leading to prolonged overproduction and misallocation of resources. Similarly, consumers may not adjust consumption patterns during shortages if prices are kept low through stock sales, exacerbating scarcity. The article highlights related risks, noting that maximum prices can cause “hoarding and black markets”, suggesting similar distortions could arise from poorly managed stock policies. Furthermore, maintaining stocks is costly and prone to inefficiencies, such as perishable goods spoiling or storage costs diverting public funds from other uses.  

The extent of the distortion also depends on the economy’s structure. In markets with inelastic demand or supply (e.g., essential foods), price volatility can cause severe welfare losses, justifying intervention. Yet in flexible, competitive markets, smoothing prices may stifle the transmission of preferences—a key function of the price mechanism. For example, if cocoa prices are stabilised despite rising demand for sustainable farming practices, the price signal fails to reward ethical producers, slowing innovation. The World Bank’s warning that price controls are “hard to remove” underscores the risk of long-term market rigidity, where governments become perpetual market participants rather than facilitators.  

Overall, while smoothing fluctuations can mitigate short-term instability, it risks undermining the price mechanism’s dynamic efficiency. A balanced conclusion is that such interventions are most beneficial in markets prone to extreme volatility with inelastic responses, but they should be temporary and targeted to avoid distorting the allocative and signalling roles of prices."

The advantages of establishing a maximum price in a market in the form of a price ceiling:

the price will be lower than what would otherwise be the case if there was no government intervention
this would lead to a lower rate of inflation in an economy
this helps the poor afford the necessities of life
these could include essential foodstuffs, housing rents and transport
specific examples given include the price of foodstuffs, including bread in Benin and rice in Haiti

The disadvantages of establishing a maximum price in a market in the form of a price ceiling:

lower prices could stimulate demandpull inflation
the creation of a shortage as a result of the excess demand created in the market
hoarding
black/illegal markets which can charge relatively high prices
queuing or rationing
if the controls are not effective, it will not control inflation




","Maximum price controls, such as those imposed on essential goods like bread in Benin or rice in Haiti, aim to control inflation by capping prices below equilibrium levels. In theory, this prevents prices from rising rapidly, directly reducing inflationary pressures on specific goods. For instance, if inflation is driven by spikes in food or energy prices—common in developing economies—targeted price ceilings could stabilize costs for necessities, shielding low-income households from hardship. This aligns with Keynesian interventions, where governments correct market failures to protect vulnerable groups. However, the effectiveness of maximum prices in controlling inflation depends on multiple factors, and they are not universally successful.

A key issue arises when maximum prices create persistent shortages. By setting prices below the market-clearing level, excess demand emerges because quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied. In the energy sector, where 89% of governments intervene, shortages could lead to rationing or black markets, as seen historically in fuel crises. Black markets often charge prices *above* the original equilibrium, counteracting the intended anti-inflationary effect. For example, if rice prices are capped but hoarding occurs, illegal markets may sell rice at even higher prices, worsening inflation for consumers unable to access regulated supplies. This undermines the policy’s goal and distorts resource allocation, as producers divert goods to illegal channels.

Additionally, maximum prices fail to address the root causes of inflation. If inflation stems from demand-pull factors (e.g., excessive money supply) or cost-push pressures (e.g., rising global commodity prices), capping individual product prices does little to resolve systemic issues. In Argentina’s case, despite strict price controls on 300 products, annual inflation exceeded 50% in 2020, illustrating the limits of partial interventions. Moreover, price controls can discourage investment in production. If firms face artificially low revenues due to price ceilings, they may reduce output, exacerbating shortages and inflationary pressures over time—a problem observed in Venezuela’s collapsing oil industry.

However, maximum prices might temporarily stabilize inflation if combined with complementary policies. For example, subsidizing producers to offset losses from price caps could maintain supply, preventing shortages. Similarly, releasing government stockpiles during shortages—as done to stabilize cocoa prices—could mitigate excess demand. Yet, such measures require significant fiscal resources and administrative efficiency, which many developing economies lack. The World Bank highlights the difficulty of removing price controls once implemented, as seen in Chile’s transport protests, creating long-term economic rigidity.

In conclusion, maximum price controls are not always effective in controlling inflation. While they may offer short-term relief for specific goods, their success hinges on strict enforcement, addressing underlying inflation drivers, and avoiding market distortions. Persistent shortages, black markets, and underinvestment often render them counterproductive, particularly in economies with weak institutional capacity. Thus, their utility is situational, and broader macroeconomic policies—such as monetary tightening or supply-side reforms—are typically more sustainable solutions."
109,"Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.

","A cartel is a formal agreement between producers to operate collectively in a market, typically by coordinating output levels or setting prices, with the aim of reducing competition and increasing profits. This collusion allows members to restrict supply, such as limiting oil production as seen with OPEC in the article, which raises prices above competitive levels by creating artificial scarcity. Cartels function by aligning the actions of firms that would otherwise compete, enabling them to exert control over market conditions for mutual benefit."
110,"Recent changes in the world oil market
The world price of oil is primarily determined by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is a cartel consisting of 15 major oil producing countries. These countries have over 75% of the world’s reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia is effectively the leader of the cartel. It exercises leadership by adjusting the output of the cartel to maintain the price agreed by the cartel’s members. Russia and the US are not members of OPEC, but they engage in collusion with the cartel by accepting the oil price agreed by OPEC.
Between 2010 and 2019 United States (US) oil production increased from 6m barrels per day (mbd) to 12 mbd, equal to the output of Russia and exceeding that of Saudi Arabia. The increase in US production was mainly through a process known as fracking, with low fixed costs and high variable costs. This contrasts with Russia and Saudi Arabia where oil production involves high fixed costs and low variable costs.
In spring 2020, faced with a falling world oil price, Saudi Arabia proposed to cut its oil production. Russia did not agree with the proposal and increased its output by 4%. Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its output by 20%. The result of this disagreement was that the world price of oil fell significantly from US$70 per barrel to under US$30 per barrel. The situation was not helped by a sharp drop in the global demand for oil as many countries shut down large sections of their economies in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
The joint action of Russia and Saudi Arabia was thought to be an attempt to undermine the US oil industry. This was because oil exports were a major source of income for both countries. Oil was responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provided more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). For Saudi Arabia, the importance was even greater. The oil sector accounted for about 70% of export earnings, and 50% of GDP.
The high price of oil in past years had enabled Russia to accumulate a significant budget surplus. The recent fall in the price of oil was thought to double the budget deficit of Saudi Arabia to US$100 billion at a time when the government was seeking to develop the country's industry and reduce unemployment.

","Collusion in an oligopoly refers to firms coordinating their actions, either formally or informally, to reduce competition and maximise joint profits. In this context, Russia and the US, while not OPEC members, engage in tacit collusion by aligning their output decisions with the cartel’s agreed price levels. This involves accepting OPEC’s pricing strategy, such as maintaining higher prices through coordinated production cuts, even without a formal agreement. For instance, if OPEC restricts output to stabilise prices, Russia and the US may implicitly limit their own production to avoid undercutting the market, thereby benefiting from the elevated prices. Such behaviour reflects a mutual understanding to avoid price wars, typical of oligopolistic interdependence, where firms recognise that aggressive competition harms all parties. However, collusion often faces instability due to incentives to cheat, as seen when Russia increased output by 4%, triggering a price collapse."

Explanation of the relationship between price and average variable costs:-

If the price remains above AVC but below ATC a US well can still make a contribution to fixed costs, reducing losses. (1 mark)
If price is less than AVC a US well cannot continue in production as losses would be greater than fixed costs. (1 mark)

Conclusion: Some US oil wells may close (1 mark) but without more detailed information on the AVC of US wells no definite estimate of the number can be made. (1 mark)

7

","The fall in the price of oil is likely to have a more significant effect on US oil output due to the differences in cost structures between US fracking operations and Saudi Arabian oil production. Fixed costs are expenses that do not vary with output levels, such as infrastructure investments, while variable costs, such as labour or raw materials, rise directly with production. In the US fracking industry, production involves **high variable costs** and **low fixed costs**, whereas Saudi Arabia’s conventional oil extraction has **high fixed costs** and **low variable costs**.  

If the oil price falls below the **average variable cost (AVC)** for US producers, they will shut down operations immediately. This is because continuing production would mean incurring losses greater than their fixed costs. For example, if the price per barrel drops to $30, and the AVC for a US fracking well is $35, each barrel sold would add $5 to losses. In this scenario, shutting down minimises losses to fixed costs alone. Even if the price remains above AVC but below **average total cost (ATC)** (fixed + variable costs), US firms may still reduce output, as operating only partially offsets fixed costs while generating negative profits.  

By contrast, Saudi Arabia’s low variable costs mean their AVC threshold is far lower. If their AVC is $10 per barrel, a price of $30 still covers variable costs, allowing them to continue production despite falling prices. Their high fixed costs (e.g., infrastructure) are ""sunk"" in the short run, so they prioritise maintaining cash flow to service debts or retain market share. This explains why Saudi Arabia increased output by 20% during the 2020 price war, aiming to pressure higher-cost US rivals.  

However, the US response depends on how many wells face AVC above the new price. Some may continue operating if prices cover AVC, contributing to fixed costs. Yet with fracking’s **high variable costs** (e.g., labour, water, sand), a larger proportion of US wells are likely to breach the shutdown threshold compared to Saudi Arabia. Without precise AVC data, the exact scale of closures is uncertain, but the structural cost difference ensures US output is more price-sensitive. Thus, the oil price collapse disproportionately threatens US production, as seen in 2020 when falling prices led to widespread fracking bankruptcies."

","The fall in oil prices, from US$70 to under US$30 per barrel, significantly impacts Russia and Saudi Arabia due to their heavy reliance on oil exports. For both economies, declining oil revenues reduce aggregate demand (AD), as exports constitute a major component of AD. This can be illustrated using AD/AS diagrams. A leftward shift of the AD curve (from AD1 to AD2) would lead to lower real GDP (Y1 to Y2) and deflationary pressure (P1 to P2), exacerbating unemployment and budget deficits.  

Russia, with its prior budget surplus accumulated during high oil prices, may adopt **expansionary fiscal policy** to counteract falling AD. By increasing government spending or cutting taxes, Russia can stimulate consumption and investment, shifting AD back to the right (AD2 to AD1). This is shown in an AD/AS diagram by an outward shift of the AD curve, restoring output and employment. However, prolonged deficits risk inflation if the economy nears full capacity.  

Saudi Arabia, facing a doubled budget deficit (US$100 billion), has less fiscal flexibility. Instead, as OPEC’s leader, it could **restrict oil supply** to raise global prices. Given oil’s price inelastic demand, even modest supply cuts could sharply increase prices. Higher oil prices would boost export revenues, shifting AD rightward (AD2 to AD1) and improving fiscal stability. However, this strategy depends on OPEC coordination—historically unstable, as seen in the 2020 dispute with Russia.  

For both nations, structural weaknesses persist. Russia’s dependence on oil (30% of GDP) limits diversification, while Saudi Arabia’s fiscal vulnerability (oil accounting for 70% of exports) underscores the risks of supply-side interventions. Diagrams illustrating supply restrictions in the global oil market (shifting supply left, raising price) and subsequent AD recovery would reinforce this analysis. Ultimately, while Russia’s fiscal surplus allows short-term demand management, Saudi Arabia’s reliance on supply adjustments highlights the precarity of cartel-dependent economies."

Innovation can occur using different factor inputs such as IT hardware and software, investment in staff training, research and development (R&D) and marketing. In 2015, the US had the most advanced software and IT services industries in the world accounting for a third of the global IT market. In 2018, the industry accounted for 12% of private sector employment and contributed 7.1% of GNP. Three of the top ten IT companies in the world were based in the US.
In 2014, in the UK, businesses spent US$26 billion on R&D, notably on digital technology and biomedical research projects that are world-renowned. However over the past 25 years R&D in the UK has only averaged between 1% and 1.3% of GNP and falls behind Japan with 3.4%, Germany 2.9%, the US 2.7% and France 2.2%.
There were concerns about the UK government reducing spending but in 2018 it made a commitment to a large investment programme in transport and communications to provide a boost to productivity. At that time one threat to the UK economy was its decision to leave the European Union’s single market. The decision created uncertainties for investors and the balance of foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that there were more investments abroad than there were foreign investments in the UK.

However, Japan’s case contradicts this trend, as it allocates the highest R&D spending (3.4% of GNP) but has the lowest productivity index (93) in 2016. This inconsistency suggests that while innovation and R&D are significant drivers of productivity, other factors—such as management practices, infrastructure, or workforce skills—may also play critical roles, as seen in the UK’s underperformance despite its “world-renowned” biomedical and digital R&D projects. Thus, the evidence supports the importance of innovation but highlights exceptions where high R&D investment does not guarantee superior productivity."

Use the information to discuss whether or not it is likely that the UK's productivity within the G7 countries will improve.
Seems unlikely to improve in the short-term (1) because:

low levels of investment over a 20 year period (1)
R&D as a % of GNP is only 1.3% 7& well below some other G7 countries (1)
poor management practices and lower skills levels generally (1)

But there are some factors which may lead to improvement in the long term (1)

world-renowned R&D in digital technology and biomedical research (1)
increased government investment in transport infrastructure (1)

","The likelihood of the UK’s productivity improving within the G7 is uncertain, with significant barriers in the short term but potential for gradual progress in the long term. On one hand, the UK faces entrenched challenges that hinder immediate improvement. Productivity has been persistently low due to poor management practices and a skills deficit in the workforce, particularly in sectors like retail and hospitality, where the UK lags 40–45% behind the US and France. Furthermore, the UK’s R&D expenditure has averaged just 1–1.3% of GNP over 25 years, far below Japan (3.4%), Germany (2.9%), and the US (2.7%). This chronic underinvestment limits innovation, a critical driver of productivity growth. Compounding this, Brexit-related uncertainties have disrupted foreign direct investment (FDI), with net FDI outflows exceeding inflows. Industries such as car manufacturing, which rely heavily on foreign-owned firms for R&D and labour productivity, are particularly vulnerable, as declining FDI could reduce technological spillovers and capital inflows. These factors suggest that short-term productivity gains are unlikely without addressing structural weaknesses in skills, management, and investment.

However, there are indications that long-term improvements may emerge. The UK has strengths in specialised R&D sectors, such as digital technology and biomedical research, where it remains “world-renowned”. These sectors could stimulate productivity if adequately funded, though current R&D spending remains insufficient relative to peers. Additionally, the government’s 2018 commitment to invest in transport and communications infrastructure may enhance efficiency over time. Improved infrastructure can reduce logistical costs, accelerate supply chains, and incentivise private sector investment, fostering multiplier effects. For example, better connectivity could enable firms to adopt lean production techniques or expand market access, raising output per hour worked. Nevertheless, the benefits of such investments are typically realised over decades, not immediately. The success of these measures also depends on sustained political will and funding, which may fluctuate with economic conditions.

The balance of evidence suggests that the UK’s productivity trajectory will remain subdued in the near future. While targeted R&D and infrastructure spending offer a pathway to gradual improvement, these are overshadowed by acute short-term challenges. The skills gap and management deficiencies require systemic reforms in education and corporate governance, which take years to implement. Similarly, reversing the decline in FDI demands stability post-Brexit, yet ongoing trade uncertainties may deter investors. Without higher R&D expenditure to match G7 peers, the UK risks falling further behind in innovation-driven sectors. Therefore, while long-term gains are plausible, immediate progress is constrained by structural and cyclical headwinds, making a significant near-term rise in productivity unlikely."

The question implies that an explanation of changes in demand and supply over the period April to July 2019 is required. So, no marks should be awarded for the usual general demand and supply factors.Demand side: new research into health benefits of avocados, buying for a special event e.g., Superbowl, panic buying. These changes will lead to a shift to the right of the demand curve.
Supply side: bad weather in Mexico leads to less supply; increased demand elsewhere reduces supply available to USA leading to a shift to the left of the supply curve


","The increase in avocado prices can be explained by a demand-side factor linked to rising health-conscious consumer preferences. Growing awareness of avocados’ nutritional benefits, such as high unsaturated fat and fibre content, has boosted demand for guacamole and avocado-based products, shifting the demand curve to the right (D1 to D2). This is evident from the article’s emphasis on “health benefits” driving global consumption growth, particularly in the US. On the supply side, drought conditions in Central America in 2018 reduced harvests, as avocado production requires intensive water use (2000 litres per kilogram). This caused a leftward supply curve shift (S1 to S2), compounding price rises. The article explicitly connects drought to “unpredictable” supply and subsequent price spikes in 2019, demonstrating how scarcity from environmental shocks restricts market availability."

The data refers to the supply of avocados as being ‘unpredictable’ and therefore difficult to control when price changes. This is a short run consideration. Longer term improved methods of farming and irrigation can make supply more responsive to price changes.

","The supply of avocados is likely price inelastic in the short run due to production constraints. The article highlights that avocado supply is “unpredictable” because production is “highly susceptible to drought conditions”, such as those experienced by Central American growers in 2018. Since avocados require 2000 litres of water per kilogram, short-term supply cannot easily respond to price increases when droughts limit water availability, making supply inelastic (PES < 1). For example, Fig. 1.2 shows price spikes in 2019, likely reflecting supply shortages that producers could not immediately resolve.  

In the long run, however, supply becomes more price elastic. The article notes that “rising prices will continue to increase production” as new producers like Kenya and New Zealand farmers enter the market, switching from dairy farming. Over time, investments in irrigation, expanded cultivation (e.g., forest clearance in Mexico), and technological improvements can increase productive capacity. These long-term adjustments allow supply to respond more flexibly to price changes, aligning with the price mechanism’s role in reallocating resources. Thus, long-run supply elasticity (PES > 1) is achievable as barriers like water scarcity are mitigated through strategic planning and innovation."

","A production possibility curve (PPC) illustrates the maximum potential output combinations of two goods an economy can produce with its available resources. For a New Zealand farmer choosing between dairy and avocado production, the PPC would have dairy output on one axis and avocado output on the other. The curve’s concave shape reflects increasing opportunity costs, meaning that as the farmer reallocates resources from dairy to avocados, each additional unit of avocados requires sacrificing progressively larger amounts of dairy. This occurs because resources such as land, labor, and capital are not perfectly adaptable—specialized dairy farmland or equipment becomes less efficient when used for avocado cultivation. Moving along the PPC from a point of high dairy output to higher avocado output demonstrates this trade-off: the slope of the curve steepens, indicating that the opportunity cost (lost dairy production) rises with each extra avocado produced. Thus, converting resources involves not just a one-time loss but escalating sacrifices as the farmer pushes further into avocado production."

The market is operating effectively-price is signalling consumer preferences and being responsive to changes in demand and supply.
Market could collapse if the health benefits prove to be wrong. New producers such as Kenya could flood the market with additional supply leading to a collapse in prices. Environmental pressures due to pressure on water supplies and forests being destroyed to plant new avocado bushes.



","The price mechanism in the avocado market has demonstrated partial success in allocating resources, though significant limitations undermine its efficiency. On one hand, rising global demand for avocados, driven by health trends and guacamole’s popularity, has led to higher prices (as seen in Fig. 1.2 during the 2018 Central American drought). This price signal incentivised new producers like Kenya and New Zealand to enter the market, reallocating resources towards avocado cultivation and expanding supply. For instance, Kenyan farmers increased productive capacity to meet Chinese demand, while New Zealand dairy farmers switched to avocado production, illustrating how price rises stimulate supply adjustments. This aligns with the price mechanism’s role in signalling scarcity and directing resources to high-demand sectors, ensuring market responsiveness.

However, the mechanism fails to account for negative externalities, leading to resource misallocation. Mexican farmers clearing forests for avocado plantations strain water supplies (requiring 2000 litres per kilogram) and exacerbate climate change, costs not reflected in market prices. The absence of pricing for environmental degradation means producers over-exploit resources, prioritising short-term profits over sustainability. Furthermore, the market’s volatility—exemplified by price spikes during droughts—creates uncertainty, potentially deterring long-term investment in efficient irrigation or sustainable practices. While rising prices encourage immediate supply increases, they do not address the long-term environmental risks, suggesting the price mechanism operates myopically. The market research report’s conclusion that “the price mechanism is not working” highlights this failure to internalise external costs, undermining allocative efficiency. Thus, while the price mechanism successfully coordinates short-term supply responses, its inability to price environmental externalities and ensure sustainable resource use indicates partial success."

","Real wages in Russia could have declined between 2016 and 2018 if nominal wage growth failed to keep pace with rising inflation. For instance, if annual inflation rates exceeded the percentage increase in nominal wages during this period, the purchasing power of wages would fall. This is particularly plausible if the depreciation of the rouble (mentioned in the extract) increased import prices, contributing to cost-push inflation. Additionally, a surplus of labour in the economy could suppress nominal wage growth, as higher unemployment reduces workers’ bargaining power, leaving wages stagnant even as prices rise. Together, these factors—accelerating inflation and weak nominal wage growth—would result in a decline in real wages."

","School lunches provided free-of-charge by the Russian government would be classified as private goods rather than public goods. Private goods are defined by two key characteristics: excludability and rivalry in consumption. Excludability means that access to the good can be restricted to those who pay or meet specific criteria, while rivalry implies that one person’s consumption reduces the quantity available for others. Free school lunches are excludable because they are typically limited to enrolled students, excluding others outside the school system. They are also rivalrous, as each meal consumed by a student means one fewer meal available for another individual. In contrast, public goods like national defence are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Although the government funds the lunches, their classification depends on their inherent economic properties, not the funding source. Therefore, school lunches align with the definition of private goods."

","Assess, using aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis, the likely impact of the changes shown in Table 1.1 upon the rate of inflation in Russia. [6] ","c

Assess, using aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis, the likely impact of the changes shown in Table 1.1 upon the rate of inflation in Russia.
For analysis of how the move to a budget surplus will affect aggregate demand through its impact on at least one component of AD and the likely consequence of this on the rate of inflation. (Up to 3 marks)
For analysis of the likelihood of the rate of inflation being controlled that considers the possible impact on AS resulting from the change from a budget deficit to a surplus. (Up to 2 marks)
1 mark for a valid conclusion

6

The data in table 1.1 shows that the government budget has moved from a deficit to a surplus and the most likely cause will be a cut in government spending and/ or an increase in taxes. Analysis should consider how this is likely to impact at least one component of AD and therefore reduce AD and control the rate of inflation.
However, this move may also affect AS and analysis should consider e.g., how reduced subsidies due to a fall in government spending, possible reduced investment due to a rise in taxes etc. may cause AS to shift to the left. Other government policies such as a cut in interest rates may also have a counter effect and may be accepted.


","The data in Table 1.1 shows Russia’s government budget balance shifted from a deficit of -2.4% of GDP in 2015 to a surplus of 2.9% by 2018, moderating to 1.8% in 2019. This transition likely reflects fiscal consolidation through reduced government spending (G) or higher taxation (T), both of which would reduce aggregate demand (AD). A budget surplus implies contractionary fiscal policy, decreasing AD via lower public expenditure (directly reducing the G component of AD) and/or higher taxes, which reduce household disposable income and consumption (C). In the AD/AS model, a leftward shift of AD from AD1 to AD2 would lower real output (Y1 to Y2) and reduce demand-pull inflationary pressures, as seen in Fig. 1.1 where inflation fell from 16.9% (2015) to 2.5% (2020). For instance, reduced subsidies or welfare spending could lower consumption, while cuts to infrastructure investment might reduce business confidence and private investment (I), further contracting AD.  

However, the impact on aggregate supply (AS) must also be considered. Prolonged austerity could reduce public investment in education, healthcare, or infrastructure, lowering long-term productive capacity and shifting AS leftward (AS1 to AS2). This would increase cost-push inflation, offsetting some disinflationary effects of lower AD. For example, reduced subsidies to energy firms might raise production costs, causing firms to raise prices. Nevertheless, the significant decline in inflation shown in Fig. 1.1 suggests AD effects dominated. Additionally, fiscal surpluses might enable monetary policy easing (e.g., lower interest rates), stimulating AD and partially countering contractionary fiscal policy. However, in Russia’s case, the sustained disinflation trend implies AD contraction from fiscal tightening was the primary driver, outweighing potential AS constraints. Thus, while AS shifts could theoretically raise inflation, the evidence supports the conclusion that reduced AD from budget surpluses effectively lowered inflation."

The fall in the price of oil is likely to reduce the value of Russia’s exports and have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments, but this is only the case if the PeD is inelastic. A possible opportunity is that costs of production will fall for domestic firms that use oil and this may impact the Russian economy by making its exports more price competitive,
The impact of the fall in the value of the rouble could be positive or negative depending upon the PED of Russia's imports and exports. There is a threat however that will result from the possible imported inflation and this may impact the Russian economy by lowering living standards.



","The significant decrease in oil prices and the depreciation of the rouble present both opportunities and threats to the Russian economy, though the balance of these effects depends on the interplay of price elasticity and structural factors. A sharp fall in oil prices poses a substantial threat to Russia, given its heavy reliance on oil exports. If global demand for oil is price inelastic—as is often the case in the short term—the revenue from oil exports would decline sharply, worsening the current account balance and reducing government income. This is particularly concerning for a commodity-dependent economy like Russia’s, where oil revenues fund public spending and influence fiscal stability. However, lower oil prices could also reduce production costs for domestic industries reliant on oil as an input, such as manufacturing or transport, potentially lowering prices for consumers and stimulating non-oil sectors.  

The depreciation of the rouble further complicates this picture. A weaker currency makes Russian exports cheaper internationally, which could boost demand for non-oil exports if their price elasticity of demand (PED) is relatively high. For instance, industries like agriculture or metals might gain competitiveness, improving the trade balance. Conversely, a falling rouble raises the cost of imports, leading to imported inflation. This threatens living standards by increasing prices for goods like electronics or machinery, which Russia imports heavily. The resulting inflationary pressure, evident in Fig. 1.1’s rising inflation rates, could force the central bank to raise interest rates, stifling investment and consumption.  

Combined, these factors create a nuanced scenario. While the rouble’s depreciation might partially offset the oil price slump by making non-oil exports more competitive, Russia’s economy remains structurally vulnerable due to its oil dependence. The immediate threats—reduced export revenue, inflationary pressure, and potential stagflation—are likely to outweigh opportunities unless the economy diversifies rapidly. However, if domestic industries leverage cheaper oil inputs and export competitiveness to expand, longer-term gains could emerge. Ultimately, the dominance of oil in Russia’s export portfolio suggests that the threats from falling oil prices and currency depreciation may outweigh the opportunities, particularly in the short term."

","Price changes in the food and non-food sectors are treated differently in Bangladesh’s CPI calculation because each category is assigned a distinct weight reflecting its proportion of total consumer expenditure. For instance, food items like fish, chicken, and vegetables may account for a larger share of household spending compared to non-food items such as healthcare or transport. Consequently, price increases in heavily weighted sectors like food have a greater proportional impact on the overall CPI than equivalent price changes in less-weighted non-food sectors. This weighting system ensures the CPI accurately represents the relative importance of different goods and services in typical consumption patterns, as households allocate income unevenly across categories."

The domestic consequences for Bangladesh of a relatively high rate of inflation could include:

redistribution of income as the real earnings of some workers in Bangladesh rise and the real earnings of others in Bangladesh fall
borrowers in Bangladesh will gain and lenders in Bangladesh will lose
menu costs in Bangladesh, e.g., the cost of changing prices
shoe leather costs in Bangladesh, e.g., the search for good returns
greater uncertainty – could discourage investment in Bangladesh
purchasing power of money for people in Bangladesh weaker

The external consequences for Bangladesh of a relatively high rate of inflation could include:

if the rate of inflation in Bangladesh is higher than in other countries (it states it is one of the highest in Asia), this will make the country's exports less competitive (the effect will depend on PED)
this may worsen the current account position of Bangladesh.



","A domestic consequence of Bangladesh’s relatively high inflation rate is the redistribution of income between borrowers and lenders. When inflation rises, the real value of money decreases, meaning borrowers repay loans with money that has less purchasing power than when they borrowed it, effectively transferring wealth from lenders to borrowers. For example, the article highlights that wages in Bangladesh increased by 6.6% in December 2019, but if inflation outpaces wage growth, workers’ real incomes fall, exacerbating inequality as fixed-income earners and savers lose purchasing power while those with debt benefit.  

An external consequence is reduced international competitiveness. If Bangladesh’s inflation rate exceeds that of its trading partners, its export prices rise relative to other countries, making its goods less attractive globally. The article notes Bangladesh’s average inflation of 6.7% is among Asia’s highest, which could diminish demand for exports like textiles—a key sector—if foreign buyers switch to cheaper alternatives. This may worsen the current account balance, as higher export prices reduce sales volumes (depending on price elasticity of demand), while imports could become relatively cheaper, further straining trade dynamics."

Demand-pull inflation:

it is stated that there has been an annual increase in the Wage Rate Index (WRI) of 6.6% in the last month of 2019
increased consumer spending, e.g., through greater consumer confidence resulting from an increase in income
the AD curve will shift to the right causing an increase in the general price level

Cost-push inflation:

wage increases to employees that are not linked to higher productivity
the AS curve will shift to the left causing an increase in the general price level

The diagrams need to be accurately labelled, with the vertical axis labelled 'general price level' or 'price level' and the horizontal axis labelled 'real output' or 'real GDP'.


","Increasing wages in Bangladesh can lead to both demand-pull and cost-push inflation through distinct mechanisms, as illustrated by aggregate demand and aggregate supply (AD/AS) analysis. Firstly, rising wages increase household disposable income, shifting aggregate demand (AD) to the right. In the AD/AS diagram, this is represented by a movement from AD1 to AD2, causing the equilibrium price level to rise from P1 to P2 and real output to expand from Y1 to Y2. This demand-pull inflation occurs because higher wages stimulate consumer spending on goods and services, particularly in sectors like food (e.g., fish, vegetables) and non-food items (e.g., healthcare, transport), as noted in the article. For instance, the 6.6% rise in the Wage Rate Index (WRI) in December 2019 likely boosted consumption, exacerbating upward pressure on prices in an economy already experiencing an average inflation rate of 6.7%.

Secondly, wage increases unrelated to productivity gains act as a cost-push factor. When firms face higher labor costs without corresponding efficiency improvements, their production costs rise, leading to a leftward shift of the aggregate supply (AS) curve from AS1 to AS2. In the AS/AD diagram, this results in a higher price level (P1 to P2) and reduced real output (Y1 to Y2). In Bangladesh, this is evident in sectors like manufacturing, where wage hikes could reduce profit margins, forcing firms to raise prices to maintain profitability. The article highlights that such cost-push pressures are compounded by rising prices in energy resources like gas, further straining production costs. The central bank’s challenge lies in addressing these dual inflationary pressures: demand-pull requires contractionary policies (e.g., higher interest rates to reduce AD), while cost-push necessitates measures to improve productivity or supply-side efficiency to shift AS rightward. However, excessive monetary tightening risks stifling growth, particularly in an economy where inflation stems from both demand and supply factors. Thus, wage-driven inflation in Bangladesh exemplifies the complexity of managing overlapping inflationary mechanisms through policy interventions."

Potential advantages of monetary policy:

a rise in interest rates can be effective in reducing the level of aggregate demand, especially if demand is interest-elastic; can be effective reducing demand-pull inflation
other monetary policies to control inflation can include a reduction of the money supply and a rise in the exchange rate

Potential disadvantages of monetary policy:

an increase in interest rates may not be significant enough to have an effect, i.e., demand is relatively inelastic
the impact of an increase in interest rates can take a relatively long time to take effect
it will be less useful in controlling cost-push inflation
a rise in the exchange rate will not be useful if the PED for imports and exports is inelastic
a reduction of the money supply may sometimes be difficult to bring about

Potential advantages of fiscal policy:

a reduction in public expenditure can help to reduce the level of aggregate demand in an economy
an increase in the level of taxes can also have such an effect

Potential disadvantages of fiscal policy:

it may not always be easy for a government to change its expenditure/revenue plans
increased taxes can have a disincentive effect
less useful controlling cost-push inflation




","The effectiveness of monetary versus fiscal policy in controlling inflation depends on the underlying causes of inflation and the economic context. Monetary policy, managed by central banks, typically involves adjusting interest rates or money supply. Raising interest rates can reduce demand-pull inflation by increasing borrowing costs, thereby dampening consumption and investment. For example, higher interest rates in Bangladesh could lower aggregate demand, particularly if households and firms are sensitive to interest rate changes. However, this approach may be less effective if inflation is driven by cost-push factors, such as rising wages or food prices, as seen in Bangladesh where the Wage Rate Index increased by 6.6% in 2019. Monetary tightening could also harm economic growth by reducing business investment and increasing unemployment, particularly if the economy is already fragile. Additionally, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy may be slow, delaying its impact.  

Fiscal policy, involving government spending and taxation, can directly target demand-pull inflation through measures like reducing public expenditure or increasing taxes. For instance, cutting government subsidies on energy or raising indirect taxes could reduce disposable income and aggregate demand. However, fiscal policy faces challenges such as implementation delays due to political processes, as seen in many democracies where legislative approval is required. Higher taxes may also disincentivize productivity and exacerbate income inequality, which could undermine long-term growth. Furthermore, fiscal policy is less suited to addressing cost-push inflation, such as the rising prices of healthcare and transport in Bangladesh, as these stem from supply-side issues rather than excess demand.  

A key advantage of monetary policy is its flexibility, as central banks can adjust interest rates swiftly compared to fiscal measures. However, in economies like Bangladesh, where inflation arises from both demand and supply factors, a combination of policies may be necessary. For example, monetary tightening could curb demand-pull pressures, while targeted fiscal measures, such as subsidies for essential goods, might alleviate cost-push inflation. Ultimately, neither policy is universally superior, but monetary policy is often more effective for demand-driven inflation, while fiscal policy can address structural issues if carefully designed. A balanced approach, tailored to the specific inflationary drivers, is likely optimal."
134,"Changes in the New York yellow taxi industry
The yellow taxi is one of New York's famous sights.
There are two types of drivers of yellow taxis: owner-drivers who own the licence and lease-drivers who pay a yearly fee for the licence to the owner. Historically, owning a licence was valuable because the demand for them has been greater than the supply. The huge demand for licences meant that, in 2011, two licences sold for US$1m each.
For lease-drivers the only way to cover the lease fee and expenses such as fuel and maintenance is to work long hours and have few days off. By 2020 the value of the licence had fallen significantly leaving owners in financial hardship.
It was in 2011 that things began to change. Until then part of New York, known as Manhattan, had always been monopolised by yellow taxis. They worked only in the busiest areas resulting in large numbers of yellow taxis often seen in movies and on television.
In 2011 the local government allowed the introduction of another taxi service (painted green) in the less densely populated areas of the city where yellow taxis typically did not go. Regulations stopped the green taxis picking up customers in Manhattan, and at the airports – unless they were pre-booked. Also in 2011, a third company launched a rival taxi service right in Manhattan. This service again could not pick up customers in the street but it could be booked on a smartphone app and was cheaper than the yellow taxi. By 2019 this new company's taxis outnumbered the yellow taxis by four to one.
In 2018, as a result of protests and strikes organised by the yellow taxi drivers' trade union, the local government agreed to limit the number of alternative taxis. Also, the body responsible for the licences did not increase the fee.
In 2018, there was also a plan to introduce a minimum wage for drivers whose taxis were booked using the smartphone app. One analyst said: 'this would put enormous economic pressure on the business model of the app-based companies who operate on methods that have very low labour costs.'
In 2019, there was a proposal to introduce a surcharge for taxis, known as congestion pricing. Every taxi trip will have a surcharge added to the fare and the funds from this would go towards repair work on the underground subway (metro) system to improve its efficiency and reduce fares.

","The article provides an example of cross-subsidisation through the proposal to introduce a congestion pricing surcharge on taxi fares, with the funds used to subsidise repairs and fare reductions for the underground subway system. This means taxi users would pay higher prices to fund improvements benefiting subway passengers, who would enjoy lower fares and enhanced efficiency.  

This cross-subsidisation could be justified on grounds of addressing negative externalities. Taxis contribute to congestion and pollution in densely populated areas like Manhattan, representing a demerit good. By imposing a surcharge, the policy internalises these external costs, aligning with the “polluter pays” principle. The revenue raised could improve subway services—a merit good with positive externalities—by reducing overcrowding and travel times, encouraging a shift from road to rail transport. This would enhance allocative efficiency, as resources are reallocated to correct market failures.  

However, critics might argue that taxi drivers and passengers unfairly bear the costs. Lease-drivers already face financial strain from falling licence values and competition from app-based rivals, as highlighted by their “long hours” and reliance on Manhattan monopolies. A surcharge could reduce demand for taxis, worsening their income. Additionally, subway improvements may take years, while taxi users face immediate price hikes without guaranteed benefits. This regressive impact could disproportionately affect lower-income passengers reliant on taxis.  

Ultimately, while cross-subsidisation risks inequity, its justification lies in correcting market failures and improving long-term social welfare, provided measures mitigate short-term harm to vulnerable groups."

","The market structure for New York taxis exhibits characteristics of a monopoly, particularly before 2011, when yellow taxis held exclusive rights to pick up street hails in Manhattan. A monopoly is defined by a single dominant firm with significant barriers to entry, limiting competition. The licensing system created artificial scarcity, as the supply of licenses was restricted, leading to their value reaching $1 million each in 2011. This barrier to entry prevented new competitors from entering the market, allowing yellow taxis to monopolise high-demand areas like Manhattan. Furthermore, even after 2011, regulations prevented green taxis and app-based services from freely competing in central areas unless pre-booked, maintaining yellow taxis’ dominance in street pickups. However, the market is not a pure monopoly, as substitutes like green taxis, app-based services, and the subway exist. Yet, the legal restrictions on competitors’ operations in key zones, combined with the licensing system, sustain monopolistic control over specific segments of the market, aligning with monopoly characteristics."

2 for identification and 2+2 for development. 1 for conclusion.

","In 2018, the local government introduced two key interventions affecting the New York yellow taxi industry. First, they limited the number of alternative taxis operating in Manhattan, reducing competition for yellow taxis. Second, the licensing body did not increase the annual licence fee for taxi owners, maintaining fixed costs at existing levels. These interventions could influence taxi owners’ profits through distinct mechanisms.  

Limiting alternative taxis reduces supply in the market, which may allow yellow taxi owners to increase fares or benefit from higher demand. With fewer competitors, yellow taxis could face less price undercutting, particularly in Manhattan where green and app-based taxis were restricted from street pickups. This could increase revenue if demand remains stable or grows, raising profits. However, the extent of this effect depends on price elasticity of demand: if fares rise but demand falls sharply (e.g., due to substitutes like public transport), revenue gains might be limited.  

Not increasing the licence fee directly reduces fixed costs for owner-drivers, improving profit margins. Licence fees are a significant fixed expense, so freezing them prevents cost-push pressures on owners, especially when licence values had already fallen sharply by 2020. For lease-drivers, stable fees might lower lease rates charged by owners, indirectly supporting their profitability. However, this intervention does not address variable costs like fuel or maintenance, which remain volatile.  

The combined effect hinges on market dynamics. While limiting competitors could enhance revenue opportunities, the long-term sustainability of higher profits depends on demand elasticity and broader economic conditions. Conversely, fixed cost stability provides immediate relief but does not stimulate growth. Thus, while both policies may support profits in the short term, their efficacy is contingent on external factors such as consumer preferences and macroeconomic trends."

In 2016 in the EU labour market there was free movement of people seeking work among the EU's 28 member countries. One country reported that an extra 252000 workers from other EU countries came to work there during 2014–2015. This meant that the total number of EU workers was 2.1 million, or 6.8% of the country's workforce. The eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 supplied 987000 of those workers by 2015.
A critic of this free movement of labour stated that ""It is the workers on low pay in the receiving country – and those out of work – who feel the consequences of uncontrolled migration. They are forced to compete for jobs with thousands of people from abroad, and they suffer downward pressures on their wages.""
In contrast, other studies have shown that migration of workers has been good for both economic growth and public finances. These studies reported ""There is no correlation between high migration and unemployment. Unemployment fell significantly as total migration rose to a record level of 392000 in May 2014. Migration is acknowledged to be positive for public finances. In the EU, migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes in the decade to 2011 than they used in welfare and public services.

","The critic argues that increased migration creates downward pressure on wages for low-paid workers due to heightened labor market competition. Using a marginal revenue product (MRP) diagram under imperfect competition, this can be illustrated as follows. Initially, the firm’s equilibrium wage is determined where the MRP curve (downward-sloping due to diminishing marginal returns) intersects the marginal cost of labor (MCL) curve, which is upward-sloping. A surge in migrant workers shifts the labor supply curve to the right, reducing the MCL at each employment level. This shifts the MCL curve downward and to the right. The new equilibrium occurs at a lower wage rate where the unchanged MRP curve intersects the lower MCL curve. The diagram thus shows wages falling from \( W_1 \) to \( W_2 \), reflecting the critic’s claim that increased labor supply depresses wages for existing workers. This aligns with the substitution effect of migrant labor increasing competition, particularly in low-skilled sectors where workers are close substitutes."

What do the high numbers of workers migrating from Eastern Europe to other countries in the EU suggest about the state of their own economies compared with the country to which they migrate? Lower wages for the same skills; higher unemployment / fewer job opportunities; weaker infrastructure and welfare systems; lower living standards.

","The high numbers of workers migrating from Eastern European countries to other EU nations suggest significant disparities in economic conditions between these regions. Firstly, the influx of 987,000 workers from Eastern Europe by 2015 implies that wages for comparable skills are likely lower in their home economies compared to the destination country. This aligns with the critic’s argument that migrants compete with low-paid workers in the receiving country, indicating wage differentials act as a ""pull factor"". Secondly, such large-scale migration suggests weaker job opportunities or higher unemployment in Eastern Europe, as workers seek employment abroad where labour demand is greater. The article notes that unemployment in the receiving country fell despite record migration levels, indirectly highlighting that migrants may fill labour shortages in stronger economies. Additionally, the reference to migrants contributing US$25 billion more in taxes than they used in welfare implies the destination country has robust public finances and infrastructure, attracting workers from economies with comparatively weaker welfare systems and lower living standards. These factors collectively indicate Eastern European economies lag in wage levels, employment opportunities, and public services relative to the host nation."

Explain whether the introduction of a minimum wage will always result in a different outcome for employment from that which would occur in a free market. Minimum wage might increase unemployment if it is higher than the wage based on supply and demand for labour. If it is lower than the market wage there will be no effect on employment. In imperfect competition (monopsony) the result will vary depending on extent of the increase, could have a rise in wage and employment, or a rise in wage but a decrease in employment.
5

","The introduction of a minimum wage does not always result in a different outcome for employment compared to a free market, as the impact depends on whether the minimum wage is set above or below the equilibrium wage. In a competitive labour market, wages are determined by the intersection of supply and demand. If the minimum wage is set below this equilibrium, it has no effect, as market forces continue to dictate wages and employment levels, meaning outcomes remain unchanged. However, if the minimum wage exceeds the equilibrium wage, it creates a surplus of labour, leading to higher unemployment as firms reduce hiring due to increased costs, altering the free market outcome.

Furthermore, in monopsonistic labour markets, where a single employer has significant wage-setting power, outcomes differ. A monopsonist pays wages below the competitive equilibrium to maximise profits, employing fewer workers. Introducing a minimum wage can increase both wages and employment if set between the monopsonist’s original wage and the competitive equilibrium. For example, raising the wage to W1 in a monopsony shifts the labour supply curve, incentivising the firm to employ more workers (Q1) up to the point where the new wage equals the marginal cost of labour. This contrasts with the free market outcome, demonstrating that under certain conditions, a minimum wage can improve employment. Thus, the employment effect varies with market structure and the minimum wage’s level relative to equilibrium."

Positive effects

skills of migrant workers can complement those domestic workers and increase productivity and therefore increase economic growth
earnings of migrant workers can create jobs – multiplier effect – increase in AD
without migrant workers the level of AS could not meet AD causing inflation
migrants fill jobs where there are labour shortages
research shows migrant workers make a positive contribution to the taxes which is higher than payments for welfare and public services spent on migrants.

Negative effects

EU workers have taken to jobs of domestic workers increasing unemployment
Increased competition for jobs drives down wages with a loss of government tax revenues
EU workers willing to accept lower wages, causing industrial unrest.

","The increasing numbers of migrant workers present both advantages and disadvantages to the receiving country, as outlined in the article. On the positive side, migrant workers contribute significantly to economic growth and public finances. Studies cited in the article indicate that EU migrants contributed US$25 billion more in taxes than they consumed in welfare and public services over a decade, enhancing fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, migration addresses labour shortages, particularly in sectors where domestic supply is insufficient, preventing inflationary pressures that could arise if aggregate demand (AD) outstripped aggregate supply (AS). Migrants’ skills can complement those of domestic workers, raising productivity and wages in the long run. For instance, if migrants possess technical expertise that existing workers lack, their presence increases marginal revenue productivity (MRP) of labour, shifting the demand curve for labour to the right and lifting equilibrium wages. This aligns with the article’s theoretical argument that complementary skills boost productivity. Additionally, the multiplier effect arises as migrant earnings stimulate consumption, increasing AD and creating jobs in sectors like retail and services. The article also notes that unemployment fell to record lows despite high migration, suggesting migrants fill vacancies without displacing domestic workers, particularly in a growing economy.  

However, there are disadvantages, particularly for low-skilled domestic workers. Critics argue that migration increases labour market competition, exerting downward pressure on wages. The article acknowledges that low-skilled workers may experience marginal wage reductions if migrants are “substitutes” for their skills, as seen in the short run when labour supply increases (shifting the supply curve rightward, reducing equilibrium wages from W1 to W2 in a competitive market diagram). This is exacerbated in sectors with high migrant concentration, such as manual labour, where an influx of 252,000 workers over two years could suppress wages. While the article dismisses the correlation between migration and unemployment, localized job displacement may occur if domestic workers cannot compete with migrants willing to accept lower pay. Moreover, the reliance on migrant labour could discourage investment in automation or upskilling domestic workers, creating long-term structural dependencies.  

The evidence leans towards net advantages. The fiscal contribution of migrants and their role in sustaining economic growth outweigh short-term wage pressures, which the article describes as “only marginal”. Crucially, the long-run adjustment mechanism allows economies to absorb migrant labour through capital investment and skill diversification, mitigating initial substitution effects. While low-skilled workers face challenges, these are offset by broader macroeconomic benefits, including higher tax revenues and enhanced productivity. Thus, the advantages of migrant workers appear more significant, provided governments implement policies like minimum wage adjustments (as mentioned in the article) to protect vulnerable workers."

'Large airlines benefit from economies of scale' With the use of an example and a diagram, explain how a large airline can benefit from economies of scale.

","Economies of scale occur when a firm experiences lower average costs as it increases its scale of production. Large airlines benefit significantly from technical economies of scale, which arise from efficiencies in production processes. For example, a large airline can purchase aircraft in bulk, negotiating substantial discounts from manufacturers due to the volume of orders. This reduces the average cost per plane, spreading the fixed costs of acquisition over a larger fleet. Additionally, larger airlines can operate more fuel-efficient routes by utilizing hub-and-spoke systems, where high-capacity aircraft serve central hubs, and smaller planes distribute passengers to secondary destinations. This optimizes seat occupancy and reduces fuel costs per passenger, further lowering long-run average costs (LRAC).  

The relationship between scale and costs is illustrated by the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve. On a diagram with cost per unit (e.g., $) on the vertical axis and quantity of output (e.g., number of flights) on the horizontal axis, the LRAC curve initially slopes downward due to economies of scale. As the airline expands its operations—increasing the number of flights or passengers—it benefits from technical efficiencies like bulk purchasing and optimized route networks, shifting the LRAC curve downward. For instance, when a large airline increases its output from Q1 to Q2, the average cost per flight decreases from C1 to C2. This downward slope reflects the cost advantages of scale, enabling super-airlines to operate at lower costs than smaller competitors, as highlighted in the article’s reference to bankrupt smaller airlines struggling without such efficiencies."

Explain what is meant by a contestable market and discuss how making the airline market more contestable could benefit passengers.

Definition of a contestable market (1): the threat of competition on existing firms (1), reference to low barriers to entry (1)
Benefit to passengers: prices, quantity or quality of service 2 examples × 2 marks


6

","A contestable market is one where existing firms face the threat of competition from potential new entrants, even if the market currently has few competitors. This threat arises when barriers to entry and exit are low, allowing firms to enter the market quickly if supernormal profits are available and exit without significant costs if they incur losses. Contestability incentivises incumbent firms to minimise inefficiencies and avoid excessive pricing, as they risk losing market share to new rivals.  

Making the airline market more contestable could benefit passengers in several ways. First, increased contestability would likely reduce fares. If barriers to entry—such as restrictive EU operating licences that prevent non-EU airlines from competing on intra-EU routes—were lowered, new entrants could challenge super-airlines. For example, the article notes that overcapacity persists despite airline bankruptcies, as surviving firms absorb assets like aircraft. Greater contestability would disrupt this consolidation, forcing dominant airlines to lower prices to deter new competitors. This aligns with the theory that contestable markets prevent monopolistic pricing (P > MC) by keeping firms allocatively efficient.  

Second, passengers could see improved service quality. In a more contestable market, the threat of competition would pressure airlines to innovate, such as by offering inclusive services (e.g., meals and entertainment) at competitive prices. The article highlights that smaller airlines currently charge extra for these services, while larger firms use economies of scale to include them. If contestability increased, super-airlines might enhance service quality to retain customers, fearing new entrants could replicate their cost advantages through flexible strategies. For instance, low-cost carriers entering the market could adopt hybrid models, combining affordable fares with better amenities, mirroring the ""hit-and-run"" competition described in contestability theory.  

Thus, reducing regulatory barriers and encouraging new entrants could counteract the dominance of super-airlines, leading to lower prices, greater choice, and higher-quality services for passengers."

Identify the market structure for airlines in Europe in 2019 following the development of the super-airlines and discuss how airlines may compete in this market structure.

Oligopoly (1)

","The market structure for airlines in Europe in 2019, following the emergence of super-airlines, can be classified as an oligopoly. This is evident from the dominance of a few large firms, with the top five European airlines controlling 50% of the market share, a figure projected to rise towards 77% to mirror the concentration seen in the United States. Oligopolies are characterised by high barriers to entry, interdependence between firms, and competition through non-price strategies. In this context, EU regulations restricting operating licences to EU airlines further reinforced barriers to entry, limiting competition from non-EU carriers and consolidating the dominance of existing super-airlines.  

Airlines in this oligopolistic market may compete through product differentiation and service quality. For instance, large airlines bundle services such as meals and entertainment into ticket prices, distinguishing themselves from smaller competitors who charge extra. This aligns with the oligopolistic tendency to avoid price wars by competing on added value rather than price reductions. Additionally, airlines might invest in brand loyalty programmes, frequent flyer benefits, or superior customer service to retain market share. The article highlights that super-airlines acquired aircraft and crew from bankrupt rivals, enabling them to expand capacity and potentially offer more routes or frequency, enhancing their competitive edge.  

Another strategy is strategic pricing, where firms tacitly align prices to avoid undercutting profits. While overt collusion is illegal, oligopolies often exhibit price leadership, where dominant firms set trends followed by others. However, the risk of price competition remains, particularly if smaller airlines adopt a low-cost model, as seen with carriers charging base fares and extras. Finally, airlines may leverage economies of scale to reduce costs, allowing them to fund innovations like premium lounges or advanced booking systems, further differentiating their offerings in a concentrated market. Thus, competition in this oligopoly revolves around service differentiation, regulatory advantages, and strategic scaling to maintain dominance."
146,"The economic impacts of the increasing use of all-electric cars
Some governments have agreed targets to reduce air pollution and, as part of this, are concerned about the social costs caused by the use of petrol and diesel vehicles. In response, car manufacturers are producing all-electric cars. The sales of these are increasing, especially in developed countries. The success of this switch to all-electric cars will depend on improving both battery technology as well as building an infrastructure in which, as drivers reduce their use of fossil fuels, electricity charging points will replace petrol pumps.
Fig. 1.1 shows the cumulative number of all-electric cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Fig. 1.2 shows the annual sales of all cars in the world between 2010 and 2016.

Some forecasters predict that about one third of the world’s cars will be all-electric by 2040. Their forecasts are based on the assumption that the costs of batteries to run these cars will have declined steeply from their present levels. Battery costs are dependent on supplies of various metals which are used as component parts. Supplies of these metals are finite and their prices, linked to mining costs, will be crucial in increasing the scale of all-electric car production.
In 2016, the cost of the batteries was 49% of the total cost of the car. In 2017 it was stated at a New Energy conference in Shanghai that battery prices would need to drop by more than half before all-electric cars would become competitive with cars powered by petrol and diesel engines. 
Oil producers claim that growth in sales of all-electric cars will not substantially reduce world demand for oil. The world needs oil for much more than just cars. Cars account for only about a fifth of the 95 million barrels the world consumes every day. Most of the rest is used in industry or to fuel heavy goods vehicles, aircraft and ships, which do not have easy non-oil alternatives. In developing economies, petrol sales are expected to continue rising because these countries do not have the infrastructure or sufficient capital investment to enable the switch to electric vehicles.

Use the information to discuss what might happen to the long-run average cost of producing batteries for all-electric cars.

Falling LRAC depends on economies of scale. LRAC comprises AFC and AVC [2].
Output of electric cars is expected to rise significantly in the long run. As output rises, AFC may well fall because of economies of scale in production [1]
However, unless battery technology changes, AVC are likely to rise eventually. Batteries are a large component of the cost, and their manufacture depends on finite supplies of component metals. As demand increases, prices will rise as mineral reserves become depleted. This could counteract possible reductions in AFC. [2]


5

","The long-run average cost (LRAC) of producing batteries for all-electric cars may initially decrease due to economies of scale as output expands. With forecasts predicting a significant rise in electric car adoption, increased production volumes could spread fixed costs such as research, development, and capital investment in battery technology over a larger output, reducing average fixed costs (AFC). For example, if battery manufacturers invest in specialised machinery or automation for mass production, the per-unit cost of batteries would fall. However, the article highlights a critical constraint: battery production relies on finite metal supplies, such as lithium and cobalt, whose prices may rise as demand escalates. This would increase average variable costs (AVC) due to higher raw material expenses, counteracting economies of scale. If mining costs rise sharply or resource scarcity intensifies, AVC could eventually outweigh reductions in AFC, leading to rising LRAC. Thus, while initial economies of scale might lower LRAC, long-term cost trends depend on balancing technological advancements in battery efficiency against volatile input prices linked to finite mineral supplies."

Use the information to assess whether it is likely that the switch to allelectric cars will substantially reduce world demand for oil. Evidence that there will be a substantial reduction in demand for oil

Forecasters predict ⅓ cars will be electric by 2040 it must reduce demand for oil as a fuel. [1]

Evidence against a large reduction in demand for oil:

In 2016 only 20 % of world demand for oil was for use as a fuel for cars. Demand for the other 80 % of uses do not have easy non-oil alternatives. Demand is, thus, relatively price inelastic. [2]
Demand for oil in emerging economies is also expected to continue to rise. They also do not have the resources to change the infrastructure to install charging points. Their demand for oil is also relatively price inelastic. [2]

On balance the evidence suggest that oil demand will not be reduced substantially. [1]

6

","The likelihood that the switch to all-electric cars will substantially reduce global oil demand depends on the interplay of multiple factors outlined in the extract. On one hand, forecasters predict that one-third of the world’s cars could be all-electric by 2040, which would directly reduce oil consumption for passenger vehicles. This substitution effect is significant, as electric vehicles eliminate the need for petrol or diesel fuel, aligning with government targets to cut air pollution. If battery costs halve, as suggested at the Shanghai conference, adoption rates could accelerate, further displacing oil use in personal transport.  

However, the extract highlights critical limitations. Cars account for only 20% of global oil demand (95 million barrels daily), with the remaining 80% used in industries, heavy goods vehicles, aviation, and shipping, sectors lacking viable non-oil alternatives. For instance, industrial processes and freight transport rely heavily on oil-derived fuels due to their energy density and infrastructure lock-in. This suggests that even a large shift to electric cars would leave the majority of oil demand unaffected. Furthermore, developing economies face infrastructural and financial barriers to adopting electric vehicles, with petrol sales expected to rise as these regions industrialise. The extract notes their inability to install charging points at scale, implying continued reliance on oil.  

Additionally, oil demand in non-transport sectors is relatively price inelastic, as alternatives like biofuels or electrification are either technologically unfeasible or prohibitively expensive. For example, aviation and shipping have no immediate substitutes for oil-based fuels, making their demand resistant to price changes. Even if electric car adoption grows, rising consumption in emerging markets and entrenched industrial use could offset reductions in passenger vehicle oil use.  

In conclusion, while the shift to electric cars may reduce oil demand in specific segments, the evidence suggests this reduction is unlikely to be substantial. The dominance of oil in non-car sectors and persistent demand growth in developing economies—coupled with the inelasticity of industrial oil use—outweigh the impact of electric vehicle adoption. The extract’s data on oil consumption distribution and infrastructural constraints support this assessment, indicating that global oil demand will remain robust despite advancements in electric car technology."

Assess the effects on the social costs of transport of replacing diesel and petrol engine cars with all-electric cars.

Some understanding required of private costs plus external costs = social costs: reward a definition and/or diagram [2]
Petrol and diesel engines emissions linked to negative externalities due to causing pollution of the atmosphere and health problems especially for those living in urban areas:MSC > MPC [1]
Electric car use will lower external costs through eliminating carbon pollution [1] but there may still be as many cars so problems of traffic congestion, especially in urban areas, will continue to get worse as demand for cars increases. [1]
Other transport – ships, planes, heavy goods vehicles – will still depend on oil and will probably increase as demand increases. External costs are likely to rise. [1]
Therefore, external costs will not be eliminated entirely. Some negative external costs will be associated also with increased mining of metal ores.[1]
However, the beneficial consumption externality of electric cars makes MSB > MPB so they will be promoted as a kind of merit good. Overall balance is uncertain. [1]

","Replacing diesel and petrol engine cars with all-electric vehicles could reduce certain social costs of transport but may not eliminate all negative externalities. Social costs encompass private costs incurred by producers and consumers as well as external costs imposed on third parties, such as pollution-related health issues. Petrol and diesel cars generate significant negative externalities due to carbon emissions and air pollutants like nitrogen oxides, shifting the marginal social cost (MSC) above the marginal private cost (MPC). All-electric cars, which produce zero tailpipe emissions, could lower these external costs by reducing urban air pollution and associated health problems, thereby aligning MSC more closely with MPC. For instance, the article highlights governmental targets to reduce air pollution, implying that electric vehicles (EVs) may mitigate the social costs linked to respiratory diseases and environmental degradation caused by fossil fuels.  

However, external costs such as traffic congestion would persist if the total number of cars remains high or increases, as EVs do not address road space limitations. Additionally, the production of electric car batteries relies on finite metals like lithium and cobalt, whose extraction involves mining activities that generate environmental degradation and social costs, such as habitat destruction and pollution. The article notes that battery costs depend on metal prices tied to mining, suggesting that scaling up EV production could exacerbate these externalities unless sustainable mining practices are adopted. Furthermore, if electricity generation for charging EVs relies on fossil fuels, indirect emissions would partially offset the benefits, maintaining a divergence between MSC and MPC.  

The article also argues that oil demand will persist because sectors like shipping, aviation, and heavy goods vehicles lack viable alternatives to oil, limiting the overall reduction in external costs. Moreover, developing economies may continue relying on petrol due to insufficient infrastructure for EVs, perpetuating regional pollution. Conversely, EVs could generate positive externalities if they accelerate renewable energy adoption or spur innovations in battery recycling, reducing long-term social costs. While the shift to EVs lowers specific externalities linked to urban air quality, the persistence of congestion, mining impacts, and incomplete decarbonisation of energy sources mean the net effect on social costs remains uncertain. A comprehensive assessment must weigh reduced emissions against emerging externalities in the EV supply chain and energy sector."

In 2018, real output in China's economy grew by 6.6%, its lowest figure this century (see Fig. 1.1). Many economists believe that growth in China's real output will continue to be around this level over the next few years.
In looking to the future, the Chinese government has sought to restructure its economy. This has resulted in an increased contribution from domestic consumption, with less reliance on large-scale manufacturing in favour of quality manufacturing. For Chinese consumers, buying a house is the main priority, followed by purchasing a new car. Table 1.1 shows the annual rate of change in new car sales from 2010 to 2017.
China's plans for maintaining its growth in real output at a rate of around 6.6% are threatened by ongoing tensions over trade with the United States (US). These tensions provide a real threat to China meeting even its most pessimistic growth targets for real output. Various studies have estimated the effects of a protectionist trade war with the US on China's economy. These estimates are all negative and range from –0.6% to –1.4% of real output.

Consider whether the evidence in Fig. 1.1 and Table 1.1 supports this relationship. It is broadly consistent (1) Highest and lowest rates of growth correspond (2010 and 2017 respectively) (1) There is positive growth in all years for both real output and sales of new cars, but rates of growth do not always match (1) Growth rate is more consistent than growth in car sales throughout (1) (2 marks)

","The evidence in Fig. 1.1 and Table 1.1 broadly supports the relationship between real output growth and new car sales. The highest growth rate for both real output and car sales occurred in 2010 (33.2% for cars, with real output growth likely peaking similarly), while the lowest growth rates coincided in 2017 (2.4% for cars and 6.6% for real output, the latter being China’s lowest this century). However, the correspondence is not exact across all years: for example, car sales growth fluctuated sharply (e.g., 15.7% in 2013 vs. 7.6% in 2015), whereas real output growth trends in Fig. 1.1 may show less volatility. Despite this, the general direction of positive growth in both metrics aligns, supporting the link between domestic consumption and real output."

State one protectionist measure that may be adopted by the US in a trade war with China and explain what effect this would have on consumers and producers in the US. Various possibilities including: • Tariff, quota, regulations (maximum of 1 mark for identifying one measure) • Increases prices of imported goods for consumers (1) and raises costs of production for producers due to higher imported raw material costs (1) increases demand for domestic producers (1) (3 marks)

","A protectionist measure the US might adopt in a trade war with China is the imposition of tariffs on imported Chinese goods. Tariffs increase the price of these goods for US consumers, reducing their purchasing power and forcing them to either pay higher prices or switch to more expensive domestic alternatives. For US producers, tariffs could create a competitive advantage by making imported Chinese goods less price-competitive, potentially increasing demand for domestically produced goods. However, if US producers rely on Chinese inputs for their production processes, the tariffs would raise their costs, leading to higher prices for their final products and reduced profitability."

",Discuss whether cuts in direct taxes would increase the demand for all types of consumer goods in China. [6],"d
Discuss whether cuts in direct taxes would increase the demand for all types of consumer goods in China. Award 1 mark for recognising that a cut in direct taxes may increase demand for consumer goods due to a rise in disposable income (1) Up to 2 marks for explanation of why a cut in direct taxes would increase demand for normal/luxury with a positive YED value consumer goods Up to 2 marks for an explanation of why a cut in direct taxes will not lead to an increase in demand for inferior/negative value consumer goods Up to a maximum mark of 5 for analysis Reserve 1 mark for a reasoned conclusion

Alternative ways of expressing disposable income are acceptable and should be rewarded, e.g. more spending power, more money in the pockets of consumers, etc.

","A cut in direct taxes, such as income tax, would increase households’ disposable income, which could raise demand for many consumer goods. For normal goods with positive income elasticity of demand (YED > 0), higher disposable income would lead to greater consumption. For example, luxury goods like cars, which Chinese consumers prioritise (as noted in the article), have high YED (>1), meaning demand would rise proportionally more than the increase in income. This aligns with Table 1.1, where new car sales grew significantly in years like 2010 (33.2%) and 2013 (15.7%), potentially reflecting rising incomes. However, demand for inferior goods (YED < 0), such as low-quality substitutes, may fall as consumers switch to higher-quality alternatives. If tax cuts disproportionately benefit higher-income groups, demand for luxury goods like housing and cars could rise sharply, while staple goods (necessities with YED < 1) might see smaller increases. Furthermore, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) influences the extent of demand growth—if households save rather than spend their extra income, the boost to demand would be muted. Given China’s economic restructuring towards “quality manufacturing” and domestic consumption, tax cuts may disproportionately increase demand for higher-value goods rather than “all types”. Thus, while tax cuts would likely increase demand for most normal goods, inferior goods could experience declining demand, meaning not “all types” of consumer goods would benefit."
