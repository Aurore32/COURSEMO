Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology.
Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on international trade.
One of the main potential negative effects of globalisation on high-income economies might be caused by the import of goods produced at low cost by other countries. This might cause a rise in unemployment.
Analysis should be provided to show the impact of selective tariffs on imports into high-income countries. A clear, accurately labelled diagram should be provided to underpin this analysis.
Further analysis should be provided to illustrate the potential impact on different stakeholders of these tariffs. For example, an increase in tax revenue can be re-invested into the economy to promote long term economic growth.

N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

The imposition of tariffs may lead to retaliation by other countries, possibly leading to a trade war and misallocation of resources.
Restricting imports and subsequent trade diversion will reduce allocative and productive efficiently and lead to a net welfare loss.
Tariffs will lead to higher prices for both consumers and producers due to lack of international competition.
In some cases, higher tariffs will lead to higher costs which could lead to higher prices, falling demand and ultimately increase the level of unemployment.
Although tariffs might reduce the negative effects of globalisation, they might also remove some existing benefits of globalisation. For example, by reducing choice for consumers.
Protecting inefficient domestic firms by using tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the economy in the long term.
A conclusion should attempt to use cost/benefit analysis and use the preceding analysis to examine the net effect of the introduction of selective tariffs by high-income countries on their economies.

A definition of what is meant by inflation.
An explanation of what constitutes the key components of the money supply. This should primarily consist of commercial bank balances held at the central bank plus all bank deposits held in the commercial banks.
Examples of the instruments available to use by the central bank to control the money supply. Reference to and explanation of Open Market operations/Quantitative Easing, plus the use of changes in interest rates should be made and explained.
The potential link between changes in the money supply and/or changes in the rate of interest rate and inflation should be examined.
Analysis of the use of specific monetary policy instruments and their impact on reducing the money supply should be provided. For example, examining the links between the sale of long-term government securities and changes in the level of bank deposits.
Analysis of how changes in interest rates/money supply might impact upon the level of aggregate demand and inflation. 

AO3 Evaluation

The money supply is very difficult to measure, thus there are many different definitions of what might constitute the money supply.
The link between changes in the money and changes in the price level is not altogether clear.
The link between changes in the rate of interest and changes in the money supply are not always clear. For example, an increase in the rate of interest might lead to an increase in savings. This would cause bank deposits and therefore, the money supply to rise.
The effectiveness of the use of monetary policy to control inflation will also depend upon the cause of inflation. For example, demand pull inflation might be controlled more effectively by the use of contractionary fiscal policy.
A conclusion should use the preceding discussion to decide the extent to which this type of monetary is likely to be used effectively to control inflation.

Characteristics of a perfectly competitive labour market should be described. This should be supported by a relevant diagram.
An explanation of how monopsony markets work should be provided, emphasising the importance of how wages are determined in this type of market.
A diagram should be provided which shows a monopsony labour market and used to show how wages and level of employment are determined.
Analysis should refer to the factors which affect both the supply of and demand for labour in both these types of labour market.

Note: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

Evaluation should then be used to link external factors which might affect final wage levels in both markets. For example, Trades Union or government intervention. In some cases, the intervention of Trades Union might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. This would support that wages would be higher in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Although a monopsony labour market model would predict lower wages due to buyer power on the part of monopsony firms, other factors will still determine the extent to which monopsony market wages will remain low. For example, the ease with which capital can be substituted for labour.
Also, the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry will influence the extent to which wages might rise in either market.
Accusations of labour exploitation might lead to government intervention in a monopsony labour market. A minimum wage might be fixed that it is higher than wages gained in a perfectly competitive labour market.
Trades Unions might also intervene in monopsony markets and enable workers to gain higher wages through collective bargaining.
Higher wages might not be sustainable in the long run in perfectly competitive markets, due to increases in the supply of labour responding to the opportunity to gain higher wages.
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the question preceding argument.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction.
This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.
One form of government intervention might be the introduction of indirect taxation. A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of an indirect taxation on the level of output and efficiency.
Analysis would use this to show the impact of an indirect tax on the PC curve.
Further analysis should then identify the links between the indirect tax and the behaviour of firms. This would link the creation of negative externalities to the benefits of removing them and then linking this to addressing this cause of market failure

N.B: L2 max if no or incorrect diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce indirect taxation however it is difficult to determine the extent of the taxation necessary which will address the issue of market failure without causing other problems, for example, an increase in unemployment.
Also, the impact of indirect taxation in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Some large firms might produce and sell products which have an inelastic demand therefore this would be unlikely to have a significant impact on output and efficiency.
The introduction of indirect taxation might be costly and unnecessarily bureaucratic, as well as being difficult to monitor and enforce.
It might be that government intervention based on the use of alternative more direct approaches such as the use of pollution permit might be more effective.
Indirect taxation is regressive and might unfairly penalise lower income groups.
A conclusion should consider alternatives, compare these with the use of indirect taxation and attempt to form some judgement regarding the effectiveness of this type of policy.

4,Distinguish between limit pricing and predatory pricing.,4,"Limit Pricing is a strategy used by the existing supplier to restrict the entry of new entrants into the market. The existing firm sets a price low enough to prevent new entrants considering it a worthwhile market in which to try and compete. They set a price possibly close to average cost so that just normal profit is made. (2)
Predatory pricing by contrast is a strategy which is used by one supplier to force another supplier already in the market to leave the market. They set a price below unit cost in the short run to drive out competition. Then later raise prices to recover those losses. It is considered anti-competitive and is illegal under their anti-trust laws. (2)

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Definition and explanation of long-term economic growth as a function of more inputs such as labour, land, and equipment creating an outwards shift of the productive possibility curve. Economic growth is measurable in terms of increases in real GDP.
Many developing countries are characterised by low incomes which prevent savings and the funds needed to finance investment and economic growth. Funding is needed to finance the investment and technological aspects of economic growth which comes from internal sources (savings) or from foreign lending/investment.
Foreign investment may be from governments (e.g. China’s Belt and Roads initiative), international agencies (e.g. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) or sovereign wealth funds. Governments borrow from other governments and international agencies to invest in infrastructure and other development projects which under lie economic growth.
Private capital investment via multinational corporations (e.g. Toyota, Intel). MNC investment is usually in factories, plant and machinery which increase output directly.
Candidates may analyse the effects of the increase in investment through aggregate supply and demand analysis.
Successful investment requires a return (marginal efficiency of capital (MEC)) which exceeds the rate of interest that has been relatively easy to obtain.
The effects of rising interest rates on developing countries: Many developing countries will suffer from falling exchange rates, especially if US$ interest rates rise this will increase the US$ funding cost of borrowings. The balance of payments (X-M) will deteriorate.
Accept references to IMF and World Bank lending investment funds.

AO3 Evaluation

Impact depends on the proportion of funding which comes from abroad and how much is locally sourced. If domestic funds are not available, then how else will the growth be funded.
The quality of the investment projects and the likelihood of realising a profit will affect the ability to cover the increase in interest rates. In some cases ‘vanity projects’ with little long-term economic benefit are funded (Roads to Nowhere) which enhance the standing of the government amongst its supporters but have no economic benefit.
The short-term effects of the project in terms of raising aggregate demand may be of limited benefit to the borrower if the lender requires much of the construction and materials to be sourced from them. This will have a negative effect on the current account of the balance of payments.
Higher interest rates in high income countries will raise the cost of borrowing by the low-income country. This means the cost of financing projects has risen representing an opportunity cost for borrowing. The balance of payments current account will deteriorate as the higher interest is paid.
Many low-income countries may be affected by a commodity price slump which reduces export earnings and depreciates a floating exchange rate making interest rate and capital repayment more expensive.

Impact depends on PED/PES for the products/services in the membership of the FTA. More inelastic PED/PES the smaller the quantity effects will be and the lower the benefits. Some countries may have very strong preference for domestically produced goods and services and the removal of tariffs has minimal effects.
The change in demand from domestic goods to imported goods will cause structural unemployment.
The removal of barriers may enable a country to ‘export’ some forms of production which are highly polluting to fellow FTA members.
Cheaper costs of production due to cheaper raw materials/components lowering domestic costs and increasing export competitiveness.

Macroeconomic:

Effect depends on the marginal propensity to export/import (MPX/M). If the net effect is that (X – M) increases, there will be a positive effect on aggregate demand.

In the 1960s/1970s there was more structural strength between wages and inflation as there was a larger proportion of unionised labour and the ability of workers to negotiate higher wages was stronger.
Since the 1950s when the Phillips curve relationship was determined, there has been a significant increase in world trade and development of MNC the supply of labour is no longer limited by national borders.

Advantages of protectionism – for example, tariffs can reduce the value of imports in the short term as infant industries grow and gain the economies of scale to enable them to be internationally price competitive. This reduction in foreign dependency will reduce the value of imports which (ceteris paribus) reduce a deficit on the current account.
Problems of protectionism includes – the ability to reduce the value of imports will be influenced by the price elasticity of demand for imports. Moreover, the possibility of retaliation thereby reducing the value of exports. This may not only limit any reduction in the current account deficit but may hinder a government’s ability to achieve other macroeconomic objectives – e.g., reducing the level of unemployment or possibility of increasing cost-push inflation.
Alternative policies that may be considered include contractionary monetary policy – higher interest rates will increase the cost of debt and mortgage repayments and leave people with less money to spend. Therefore, this will reduce their consumption of imports, improving the current account.
Problems of the alternative policy – for example, an increase in interest rates will tend to cause hot money flows and therefore an appreciation in the exchange rate. This appreciation makes exports less competitive, and imports more attractive. Assuming demand is relatively elastic, this appreciation will worsen the current account.

An explanation of cost-push inflation – when the price level rises due to higher costs of production and raw materials (1).
An accurate aggregate and aggregate supply diagram showing a shift to the left of the short run AS curve (1).
This results in a rise in the price level and a contraction/movement along the aggregate demand (AD) curve (1).

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Points to consider:

For example, an increase in wages/salaries increases the firm’s costs of production (1). Firms will look to pass these additional costs onto its customers which increase the price of all goods and services (1).
Increased import prices (due to a depreciation of the domestic currency) (1) will increase the costs of production to firms that are reliant on other countries to produce raw materials/price inelastic demand for imports (1)

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)

Evaluation should explain the extent to which inflation in the named economy is the result of cost-push factors as opposed to demand pull causes (1), leading to a justified conclusion (1).

Potential benefits of an increasing rate of inflation include:

It stimulates output – a low and stable inflation rate caused by existing demand may make firms feel more optimistic about the future and encourage them to invest to expand their business.
A possible reduction in the burden of debt. If inflation is rising faster than the nominal rate of interest on previous borrowing then real interest rates become negative which may stimulate consumer expenditure which, in turn, could lead to higher output and employment. 

Potential costs of an increasing rate of inflation include:

A reduction in net exports as rising inflation rates may reduce the international competitiveness of a country resulting in reduced export revenue and increased import expenditure.
Fiscal drag – if tax rates are not increased in line with inflation, then people are ‘dragged’ (pulled) into higher tax brackets. As such, lower proportions of any increase in incomes are enjoyed by the taxpayer.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding (max 3 marks)

An explanation of how inequality of income and wealth means an uneven distribution of income and wealth among a population (1).
An explanation of two reasons for income and wealth inequality. – For example: Poor education and training results in the individual gaining fewer/less marketable skills that prevents them from applying for jobs with higher salaries (1). – Low rates of saving which makes it increasingly difficult to buy property. Wealth inequality widens as rising property prices not only make it more difficult to purchase a property, but benefits those who are already property owners (1).

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Points to consider may include (other difficulties may be considered):

Wealth is comprised from many sources housing assets, savings, financial instruments, pensions, and different countries have different ways of measuring it (1).
Some wealth may not be included in any calculation should wealthy individuals legally use tax havens to reduce the value of their wealth (1).

Polices may include:

Use of policies to redistribute income. For example, the introduction of a minimum wage (or increase an existing minimum wage) will increase the wage of the lowest earners and reduce the difference between the highest and lowest earners.
Problems of minimum wages include the possibility of increasing costpush inflation, higher rates of unemployment and that in some countries only a small proportion of the population are in receipt of the minimum wage.
Alternative policies that may be considered include progressive tax systems – by increasing the number of tax brackets or increasing the higher tax rates will reduce the post-tax income of higher earners and reduce the difference between the highest and lowest earners.
Problems of the alternative policy – for example, increased incentives for individuals to seek ways to legally avoid the higher tax rates. Increased administrative costs associated with implementing new systems for income assessment and tax collection.

Free goods are not scarce and have zero opportunity cost / no prices as no factors of production are required to produce them (1).
Public goods have two main characteristics of non-excludability and nonrivalry with a brief explanation of both terms (1).
Provide accurate examples of both e.g., fresh air and street lighting respectively (1).

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)

For example, the vaccine is free at the point of use to the consumer (1). However, there is a cost to the taxpayer (1). This means that there is an opportunity cost to the government as providing the vaccine involves the use of scarce resources (1).

Alternative approach:

If governments provide free-of-charge vaccinations, then there is no price charged to the consumer (1). This means consumers do not need to use their own their own scarce resources to be vaccinated (1) which means there is no opportunity cost to them because they do not need to make a choice between ‘consuming’ the vaccine and reducing their consumption of other goods and services (1).

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks)

Up to 2 marks for evaluating whether or not free-to-charge vaccinations offered by a government can be considered a free good. For example, there is an opportunity cost to the government as the money spent on buying the vaccine might have been used for spending on another priority e.g. education.

This question is asking whether a balanced budget should always be a main objective rather than the main objective and consequently an analysis of the importance of other government macroeconomic objectives is not essential.
An analysis which directly compares the strengths and weaknesses and uses of a balanced budget with a budget in surplus and deficit may gain access to Level 3 and full marks.
The strengths of a balanced budget may include stability and may encourage both domestic and inward investment, but it may not be sufficiently flexible to deal with changing economic conditions e.g., unemployment and inflation.
A budget deficit may enable, e.g., economic growth or reduce unemployment but may be unsustainable in the long run.
A budget surplus may be necessary to solve inflation, but this may cause opportunity costs due to a lack of government spending.
Analysis of other government macroeconomic objectives may be rewarded but only in the context of a balanced or unbalanced budget e.g., the problems of achieving other objectives if the sole aim is a balanced budget. These may include difficulties in controlling inflation, unemployment, creating actual economic growth etc.

Answers focused on types and not measures cannot answer the question without any reference to methods of measurement and must not be rewarded. For the identification of 2 methods of measuring unemployment (1) plus for a brief explanation of both measures 2x(1).
Guidance for explanation marks: The two most used measures are the claimant count measure which is a measure based on those claiming benefits (1) and the labour force measure which is a measure of unemployment based on a survey that identifies people who are actively seeking a job (1). However, if the meaning of these measures is clearly understood then they do not need to explicitly refer to the terms.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

The discussion should focus on the strengths and weaknesses of supply side policy to solve both cyclical/demand-deficient and structural unemployment.
For example, supply side policies may be used to encourage investment into education and training and infrastructure to solve structural problems in the economy and hence structural unemployment.
However, supply side policies may be less successful in solving cyclical/demand deficient unemployment as they have less impact on the level of aggregate demand (AD) – unless for example, if they involve a direct injection of government spending due to the additional investment.
Other disadvantages include the potential cost of the policy and the time taken for the policy to be effective.
Although not necessary, other demand side policies, e.g., fiscal and monetary policies, may be analysed to explain the possible disadvantages of supply side policy. This is an acceptable approach.

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)
Candidates may analyse the impact on the demand for one good as a result of whether they are substitutes or complements of other goods (of any valid relationships between goods): 
This will include an analysis of the impact on demand for one good because of e.g.:

Price changes and the availability of complements (a negative value indicates a complement) e.g. a rise in the price of the complement would be expected to reduce the demand for the ‘other good’.
Price changes and the availability of substitutes (a positive value indicates a substitute) e.g. a rise in the price of the substitute would be expected to increase the demand for the ‘other good’.
For example, an increase in the price of a complement good is likely to reduce the demand of the good (1) due to the nature of the joint demand between both goods (1).
For example, a rise in the price of a substitute good is likely to increase the demand for the other good (1) if the consumer now sees the other good as a direct replacement (1).

Identification and explanation of market failure regarding this question may relate to allocative inefficiency, productive inefficiency or information failure. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC or MSB = MSC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency. 
Productive inefficiency occurs when the firm is not producing at its minimum average costs. Forms of competition other than perfect competition may be used to show both the lack of allocative and productive efficiency.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market 
forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-consumption of a good or service. The negative externality leads to an over production of the good. 
A wide range of government intervention can be used to correct market failure. These may include:subsidies to increase consumptionindirect taxation producersuse of advertisingthe direct provision of goods and servicesprice restrictions/quantity direction 

A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive/negative externality on the level of output and the welfare change will be identified. 

The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of market failure and may compare this with the efficient level of output when the market failure is taken into account. 
The diagram may be amended or re-drawn to show the impact of a chosen policy(ies) and the impact on consumption or production shown.
Reference to the diagram and the outcomes it illustrates showed be made in the text. 

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy/indirect tax to encourage consumers/producers to change behaviour, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy/indirect tax. 
Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.
Indirect taxes may be used to offset the effect of the market failure. 
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long
time to become effective depending on the length of contract or production process.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached. 
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces. 
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities, but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Efficiency may not be achieved because of 

Market failure, explained by reference to possible excessive profits, the need for very large investments, the existence of externalities, merit goods and of the need for public goods.
Government intervention can help overcome this by regulation, taxation, subsides, or ownership aimed at achieving productive and allocative efficiency.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding (max 3 marks)

Explanation of what is meant by the terms of trade i.e., the ratio of export price index to the import price index. (1)
It measures the number of exports that have to be sold to buy a given number of imports. (1)
Terms of trade are said to improve when the ratio increases and / or to deteriorate when the ratio falls. (1) 

AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks) 

The two main causes of changes in the terms of trade occur e.g., when there is an increase in export prices and a fall in import prices. Such changes are often the result of changes in the demand for exports and the demand for imports. (1) 
Low-income countries are more likely to export primary goods and to import manufactured goods. The demand for primary goods may be lower than that for manufactured goods when income rises, e.g., for agricultural goods, so import prices may fall and terms of trade deteriorates. (1) 
However, commodity prices such as oil may have an inelastic demand and prices may rise leading to an improvement in terms of trade. (1) .

AO3 Evaluation (max 2 marks) For evaluation that considers the significance of changes in terms of trade for low-income countries that are producers of food stuffs and similar products compared to the benefits for low-income countries that have exports of products such as minerals that are in high demand in high-income countries.

Points to consider:
A subsidy may encourage poorer households to consume more merit goods as the reason for underconsumption may be unaffordability as it reduces the price of merit goods. (1)
However, quantity demanded may be price inelastic meaning it is less responsive to price changes so quantity demanded will be less responsive to the change in price/the rise in quantity demanded would be less than the decrease in price. (1)

AO1 Knowledge and Understanding (max 3 marks) For a clear understanding of what the Gini coefficient is e.g., it is a numerical measure of the extent of income inequality in an economy (1) if there is no inequality the value will be zero and at the other extreme, if all income is earned by one person the value will be one (1) For an explanation that the nearer the value is to zero income is more equally distributed and/or the nearer the value is to one the more it is unequally distributed (1). 
AO2 Analysis (max 3 marks)Reasons may include: 

A lack of employment opportunities e.g., which will mean that income levels are low (1) which may be more of a problem in low-income countries because industry may be less well developed (1). 
Poor vocational training e.g., leading to fewer people being able to develop their skills and earn a higher income (1). This may be more of a problem in such countries because of the lack of finance to provide such training. (1) 
A lack of investment in education and health e.g., meaning that some people may not receive a better level of education or may suffer long term health issues which will lower their potential income levels. (1) This may be more common in such countries due to a lack of government budget (1)

Investment in infrastructure 

Accept any valid policies but the analysis must focus on how they may be used to redistribute income and wealth and their advantages and disadvantages to be credited. 
E.g., A minimum wage rate that is set above the equilibrium, should increase the income levels of those on the lowest levels and therefore possibly ensure that poverty is reduced. However, if everyone’s income levels increased, this will not have a redistribution effect. It will not impact on the self-employed. It may lead to unemployment and more poverty leading to less redistribution if businesses cannot afford the higher rates. 
E.g., Progressive income taxes should ensure that those on lower incomes pay less tax as a percentage of income than those on higher incomes. This should have a redistributive effect. However, those on higher incomes may have the ability to reduce their tax burden or may simply leave the country. It may also reduce incentives to earn more.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of high-income countries would include: high levels of productivity; high GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting secondary/tertiary goods/services.
High living standards are generally associated with: low poverty levels; advanced infrastructure; good housing, education and health; and low infant mortality rates.
Economic growth is usually measured by changes in real GDP per capita in a specific time period.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita.
Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth. 
Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a high-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in economic growth and an increase in living standards are not clear. Economic growth is a quantitative measure not a qualitative measure
Economic growth which depends upon globalisation would increase long distance transport which would create more negative externalities.
It is not clear how any benefits of economic growth might be used in a high-income economy
Globalisation might lead to an increase in cheap imports from low-income economies which might lead to higher levels of unemployment in more advanced economies.
A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term benefits of globalisation in relation to the improvement of living standards in high-income countries. Also a judgement should consider whether this will automatically improve living standards.

Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to increase aggregate supply, in the long term, by increasing productivity through direct investment. For example, by increasing expenditure on education/infrastructure. This analysis might also be supported by a relevant diagram
In the short term, a government might focus on attempting to reduce the cost of producing goods and services by introducing widespread subsidies, reducing indirect taxation, removing tariffs on key imports or the use of incomes policies.

L2 maximum if no accurate diagram providedMust refer to some supply side polices to gain L3 marks
AO3 Evaluation

Increasing the use of subsidies and/or decreasing the use of indirect taxation is likely to have a negative effect on a government’s budget. For example, increasing the budget deficit and subsequently increasing the need for more government borrowing.
Removing tariffs is likely to have a negative effect on the incomes and output of domestic producers and possibly lead to an increase in unemployment
The introduction of incomes policies is likely to lead to opposition from trade Unions and the possibility of industrial disruption.
Long run supply-side policies are likely to focus on attempts to increase productivity. This frequently involves significant investment in new technology which will lead to a rise in unemployment in the short run
Other policies which might be used in the long run might include immediate investment in skills training and improving the quality of the infrastructure. Skills training is expensive and hence has a high initial opportunity cost. While the immediate effect of an increase in expenditure on improving the infrastructure is likely to increase aggregate demand and add to the inflationary pressure 
A conclusion should attempt to assess the relative effectiveness of each type of policy approach and consider which approach is likely to be the most effective in the short run and then compare this with possible outcomes that might be achieved in the long run.

Analysis should discuss alternative ways in which a trade union might affect wages and employment. References might be made to factors which affect both the supply of and demand for labour.
Analysis should then be used to determine the extent to which the intervention of a trade union can influence wage and employment levels in a perfectly competitive labour market.

L2 maximum if no accurate diagram provided.
AO3 Evaluation

In some cases, the introduction of trade unions might lead to an increase in the productivity of the workforce through the provision of better training. Although an increase in productivity might also be produced by substituting capital for labour which might lead to an increase in unemployment.
Trade unions might gain higher wages for labour but because this makes capital relatively cheaper, machines might be substituted for labour which will further reduce employment.
The impact of higher wages on employment will also depend upon how easy it is to substitute capital for labour and the existing proportion of capital to labour in the particular industry.
If trade unions manage to bargain for higher wages but the new wage is above the market equilibrium, there will be an excess supply of labour at the new wage leading to higher unemployment. The extent of this impact will be determined by the relative elasticities of supply of and demand for labour
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

The link between climate change on negative externalities is very difficult to accurately establish
It is also extremely difficult to measure negative externalities
The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all negative externalities because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.
The use of minimum prices to reduce negative externalities would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces.

Aid can be defined as any assistance given to a country that would not be provided through normal market forces.
There are two main types of aid, humanitarian aid; development aid. Development aid would include many different types including: long term loans; tied aid; bilateral aid and multilateral aid.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population grow.
Aid that focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
Aid can increase real wealth and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in aid and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes aid only reaches a relatively small section of the population. For example, due to corruption.
Different types of aid might produce different outcomes. For example, aid in the form of long-term loans might make it more difficult for low-income countries to escape the cycle of poverty.
Aid is sometimes given for political reasons rather than the low-income countries where the need is the greatest.
Tied aid might mean that low--income countries receiving such aid have to purchase goods and services from the donor country which are more expensive.
Long term dependency upon aid might lead to a welfare mentality and reduce levels of innovation in the low-income country.
A conclusion might attempt to form an overall judgement on the short term and long-term efficacy of development aid in relation to the improvement of living standards in low-income countries.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

Fiscal policy would require a government to use taxation and government expenditure changes to influence key macroeconomic goals such as inflation, economic growth and the level of employment.
An output gap will show the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.
A negative output will indicate that there is spare capacity in an economy which will be primarily due to insufficient aggregate monetary demand. A relevant diagram can be used to illustrate this gap.
Analysis can be used to show how a government will be able to significantly influence aggregate demand by either increase its expenditure or reducing the overall level of taxation.
A budget deficit will inject additional demand into an economy which will have a magnified effect on output, income and employment due to the positive contribution of a multiplier effect.

AO3 Evaluation

Fiscal policy could help to close a negative output gap by increasing a government’s budget deficit but this may lead to higher interest rates and crowding out in the private sector.
It is difficult for a government to produce an accurate forecast of the magnitude of the output gap.
Although a budget deficit might help to reduce a negative output gap in the short run, if the deficit is financed by increasing the money supply, this might lead to inflation in the long run.
Alternative policies such as supply-side policies might be more effective by closing the output gap while avoiding the risk of inflation in the long run.
Expansionary fiscal policies used to close an output gap might lead to an increase in the demand for imports and subsequently, a negative impact on the country’s balance of payments.
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low.
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

Analysis should then be used to compare short run and long run outcomes on both types of market. 

AO3 Evaluation

Some monopolies might invest in new technology and achieve dynamic efficiency. This will enable lower average total costs and an opportunity to pass the benefits of lower costs on in the form of lower prices.
Similarly, monopolies might benefit from economies of scale which might also lead to lower prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms might incur additional costs through the need to engage in non-price competition. This might lead to higher prices.
Monopolistically competitive firms will achieve productive efficiency in the long run but a profit maximizing firm will not operate at an allocatively efficient level of output.
A conclusion should attempt to address each element of the statement by addressing both price levels and efficiency outcomes in relation to both types of market structure. The key word ‘always’ should be considered in the light of the preceding argument.

Analysis of how market forces can be used to solve the problem of market failure, caused by negative externalities.

AO3 Evaluation

Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximisation and this might lead to these firms focusing upon private costs and ignoring social cost.
The use of taxation to influence price and output is unlikely to remove all market inefficiency because it is very difficult to measure the correct amount of taxation that should be applied.
The use of minimum prices would only be partially effective and might have significant effects on firm’s profits and employment.
Alternatives to the use of the price mechanism might, in some circumstance, allow a government to achieve a more precise control of negative externalities. For example, through the use of a complete ban of consumption/production.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. through direct government intervention or through the use of market forces. Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Definition of GNI: the total income earned within a country in a year plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production. This is an aggregate measure of an economy’s income.
GNI measures in monetary terms.
For many developing countries which rely on remittances from overseas workers, this will boost the value of GNI.
Other countries that have invested overseas will receive a stream of dividends and interest that boosts their GNI.
Definition of the MPI
Some explicit breakdown of the categories which are involved in the construction of MPI
Health: 1/3rd weighting includes child mortality and nutrition (1/6th each);
Education: 1/3rd weighting includes years of schooling and school attendance (1/6th each); and
Standard of living 1/3 weighting includes cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing and assets (1/18th each).
The measures are fundamentally different in their approaches GNI is concerned with money values whilst MPI is concerned with the adequacy of provision of a number of essential services and goods linked to the Millennium Development Goals.

AO3 Evaluation
Evaluation may be by individual measure or by comparing the measures.

GNI The comprehensiveness of the data collection: 
The GNI figures needs deflating for the effects of price increases and changes in the population to achieve real GNI per head, which allows for comparisons over time.
The range of incomes which are included ‘the dark economy’, illegal activity – drugs crime etc. the ability to count all income flows between countries. 
Incomes from activities that produce negative externalities or are the result of monopoly profits increase the GNI but reduce the level of economic efficiency.
Real GNI per head can be used as a simple measure of economic growth but lacks a distributional measure. Additional measures such as the Gini coefficient need to be calculated to gain a measure of the distributional effect of a given GNI. Both these measures are averages which disguise a wide range of individual circumstances.
The data collection for MPI is more complex than for GNI. The criteria for GNI are well established and are given.
Monetary-based poverty measures can omit a lot. The overlap between monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty is not perfect. In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.
Economic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation. Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.
Real GNI per head data is available for 188 (most) countries of the world whilst MPI data is only available for 103 poorer countries.

AO3 Evaluation

Consumer rationality: indifference analysis assumes that consumers act rationally. They are of a calculating mind, carrying numerous combinations of different commodities in their heads, can substitute one for the other, compare their total utilities and make a rational choice between various combinations of goods.
As the effect of a reduction in price is an increase in demand for both a normal and inferior good (except in the case of Giffen good) it is not possible to know whether a good is normal or inferior.
It is difficult to apply the concept of substitutability to goods such as consumable durables, which are one-off indivisible purchases and the choice is between, for example, 1 fridge and 4 weeks’ food.
A consumer is faced with a much more complex world than the two-good world of the model because a consumer buys not just two but a large number of commodities to satisfy their innumerable wants.

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer of technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
High-income countries are likely to benefit from access to a wide range of goods and services and access to good health care and education.
Comparative advantage allows high-income countries to increase their standard of living by providing access to cheap raw materials produced in low-income countries.
Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries.

Assess the contribution of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the improvement of the standard of living in low-income countries.

Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion.

FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.
This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.
FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a lowincome economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living. 

However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run.
AO3 Evaluation

The links between globalization and the costs/benefits imposed on lowincome countries is not clear. For example, low-income countries might benefit significantly from the transfer of new technology from high income countries.
Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore helping to train the indigenous population.
Globalisation through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth which can then be used to provide merit goods such as health care and education.
In some cases, individual firms in low-income countries might gain access to large markets in high-income countries which will subsequently allow new businesses to grow
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to benefit both high and low-income countries, but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall positive impact.

This merger is an example of horizontal integration where two firms merge at the same level in the production cycle.
Mergers of two large firms producing similar goods, at the same level in the production cycle is likely to lead to a monopoly market structure.
Monopoly providers, through market dominance, can raise prices and drive smaller firms out of business. A diagram might provide supporting analysis.
Given the nature of the goods provided, this merger might also lead to significantly less choice.
A large, dominant organization might have less incentive to operate efficiently and X inefficiencies might occur.
Analysis of the potential negative impact on the local labour market.

NOTE: Limit of Level 2 if no relevant diagram
AO3 Evaluation

Merging firms might argue that an increase in size will lead to more opportunities to provide a wide range of goods and therefore more consumer choice.
Also, it is possible that the merger will lead to an increase in dynamic efficiency and this increase would allow long term more investment and ultimately lower prices. A supporting diagram can be provided.
Such a merger will enable the firms to benefit from economies of scale. For example, reducing managerial inefficiencies. This could also lead to lower prices.
Any potential negative effects of this merger can be accounted for by government intervention and regulation when the merger takes place.
A conclusion should refer to the preceding analysis and then make some attempt to make a judgement whether, on balance, the merger should proceed.

Analysis of the relationship between the public provision of health care and efficient outcomes should be provided.
Analysis of the possible causes of inefficiency relating to the provision of health care by the public sector

AO3 Evaluation

Private providers of health care are unlikely to provide an allocatively efficient level of health care because of a failure to take into account the additional benefits of positive externalities.
Private firms are likely to aim for profit maximization and this might lead to a higher cost of receiving health care.
If access to health care in the private sector is based on an ability to pay, this might create inequitable outcomes in society.
The pursuit of profit might lead private firms to cut costs and reduce any unnecessary bureaucracy thus leading to a more efficient use of scarce resources.
The substitution of public provision by private provision might enable additional resources to become available in the public sector.
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative ie private or public sector provision of health care.
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/consumption is reached.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

In theory, low interest rates would boost the economy by encouraging consumers and investors to take more risks when borrowing. (2)

For a rise in the terms of trade:

This may lower inflation if raw material import prices are lower.
Depending on price elasticity of demand, it may lead to economic growth if the income earned from exports increases and a boost to employment.
It may however lead to lower economic growth if it leads to a current account deficit.

For a fall in the terms of trade:

Exports may be boosted, and this may lead to higher economic growth.
It may reduce a current account deficit.
It may however be a sign of a weak economy with exports that are less in demand and therefore lead to lower economic growth.
If imports are price inelastic, this may lead to import cost-push inflation if the economy is highly dependent on imported goods.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

An analysis of how private goods (which include merit and demerit goods) are allocated within an economy through the demand and supply mechanism.
An explanation of the existence of imperfect information with respect to merit and demerit goods and the associated problems of under or overconsumption.
An explanation of how this is likely to lead different methods of allocation for both merit and demerit goods than for other private goods, (how other private goods are allocated and how this differs from the provision of merit and demerit goods and any other problems that may be associated with their allocation.)
Analysis should consider the consequences of imperfect information in both a market and a mixed economy for the provision of merit and demerit goods compared to other private goods.
Answers which do not compare the provision of merit/demerit goods in both a market economy and a mixed economy cannot gain more than L2.

AO3 EvaluationPoints to consider include

Merit goods and demerit goods need government intervention because of the issues of under and over consumption due to imperfect information, so the market economy fails to operate efficiently.
Other types of private good can be efficiently provided by the market economy without government intervention but the process of allocation may mean e.g., low-income groups do not have the same access to certain goods.
Leading to a justified conclusion answering the question of whether the consequences of imperfect information are more serious in a market economy than a in mixed economy.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Analysis of the concept of price elasticity of supply may explain its use in increasing a business' total sales by examining the following.

Usefulness depends on the type of goods and whether decisions need to be made in the short run or long run.
It may help businesses with regards to stock holding and decisions about which products to focus on
It may help businesses make decisions about productive capacity and whether e.g., to invest in new technology BUT
It depends on the accuracy of the data used to produce the value.
This may change over time and the value may have little value in a growing economy.
Some products, such as agricultural/perishable products, will naturally have a more price inelastic supply and knowledge of the value may have little use.

Analysis of the concept of cross elasticity of demand may explain its use in increasing a business’s total revenue by examining the following.

It will mean the business understands the relationship between its product and others i.e., whether they are complements or substitutes.
It also measures the closeness of the relationship and informs decisions about how quickly and the extent to which it should react for example if a competitor changes its prices.
It should assist a business to develop a pricing strategy that maximises opportunities to generate more sales BUT
The usefulness depends on the accuracy of the data and in a growing economy, it may not be possible to keep the value up to date. It is therefore often dependent on estimates that may be inaccurate.
Businesses may not be able to act on the data by changing prices if their cost structure cannot be easily changed.
Other variables other than cross elasticity of demand may be more important for example non price determinants such as brand loyalty.

Better answers will refer directly/implicitly to their usefulness to a business operating in a growing economy. Answers which do not are unlikely to gain more than L3 lower band.

PED should be easier for a firm to calculate than YED.
PED will indicate whether price should be increased or decreased.
However, a firm will need to take into account the availability of substitutes, the amount spent on the product and the time period under consideration.
YED will be helpful in giving a firm an indication of the extent to which a change in income may affect spending on cars.
However, a firm will need to take into account whether a car is seen as a normal or an inferior good, the proportion of income that is spent on the car and whether an economy is experiencing an upturn or a downturn.
In conclusion, PED is likely to be of greater importance than YED, but YED will still be of some use.

An explanation of the impact of higher interest rates to reduce inflation either through consumer demand or its impact on investment. This can be shown either through the monetary transmission mechanism analysis or AS/AD analysis. 
Alternative macroeconomic aims of the government are identified for example economic growth, unemployment and balance of payments. 
The model employed to analyse the reduction in inflation is applied to the alternative aims to find the outcomes. 
Phillips curve analysis may be used to demonstrate the relationship between inflation and employment to illustrate the unlikelihood of both low inflation and low unemployment being achieved together.

This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC or MSB = MSC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency. 
Negative externalities occur when the when the consumption/use of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that received by an individual producer MPB > MSB or MSC >MPC. This is sometimes described as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect. The negative externality leads to an over production of the good.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-consumption of a good or service. 
Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised. 
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies for consumers to increase consumption and also producers to change production methods, use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services such as alternative transport methods. Indirect taxation. Nudge theory effects. 
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive/negative externality on the level of output and the welfare change will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a negative consumption externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the negative externality is taken into account. The diagram may be amended or re-drawn to show the impact of a chosen policy(ies) and the impact on consumption or production shown. 
Reference to the diagram and the outcomes it illustrates is made in the text. 

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy. 
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached. 
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces. 
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Analysis of the links between a budget surplus and the control of a balance of payments in the long run.

AO3 Evaluation 

The impact of a budget surplus in the short run on the level of unemployment will depend upon the main cause of the existing level of unemployment. 
A budget surplus is more likely to have a negative effect on unemployment when an economy has a lot of existing spare capacity.
If structural factors are responsible for unemployment, supply side policies might be more effective. 
A budget surplus might lead to lower interest rates and cause problems for specific industries within an economy. For example, low interest rates might cause a boom in the housing market.
If a budget surplus leads to a subsequent fall in interest rate, this might ultimately make it more difficult to control a balance of payments in the long run. 
A conclusion should make an attempt to make an overall comparison between the use of monetary policy and alternative fiscal or supply side policies. A judgement should be made which directly addresses the statement in question.

AO3 Evaluation
If firms are rational profit – maximisers, the firms must benefit from their action therefore the initial point that the producer will always benefit is true. 
As total spending on the good / service takes place this represents a transfer of consumer surplus to the producers. 
But it depends on whether the firms gain at the expense of consumer and society. 
If the price discrimination exists between domestic and foreign markets The producer may also be able to drive competition from the foreign market if it charges high domestic prices / recovers overheads domestically. This may improve a country’s balance of payments. 
Some consumers gain and some lose. The lower price in the low PED market will benefit those consumers in that market whilst the opposite occurs in the High PED market. 
The increase in profits may allow the producer to increase its research and development leading to innovative production techniques which lower long term costs – dynamic efficiency. The benefits of the dynamic efficiency may be enjoyed by consumers / society as lower prices. 
The assessment of the statement should conclude with the view that it should benefit the producer as a matter of rationality but whether this is always at the expense of consumers / society is debateable. Accept all valid responses.

Where no diagram – max marks top L2 
AO3 Evaluation

The use of subsidies to encourage the provision of education in the private sector might not be entirely successful because of the difficulties involved when attempting to assess the precise level of subsidy required to achieve an allocatively efficient outcome. 
Subsidies provided by the public sector are often expensive and their use will automatically create opportunity costs. For example, money spent on state subsidies to health care 
Subsidies in the private sector will mean that access to education is still based on an ability to pay, this might create inequitable outcomes in society. 
The pursuit of profit supported by subsidies might enable private firms to cut costs and reduce any unnecessary bureaucracy thus leading to a more efficient use of scarce resources. 
Direct state provision of education might lead to less efficient outcomes and reduce the time taken to ensure a high standard of education is available on an equal basis throughout the population. 
A conclusion should be attempted which examines the net benefits of each alternative i.e. private or public sector provision of education. 
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective. 
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output / consumption is reached

Indicative content 
Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis (max 8 marks)The advantages of encouraging entrepreneurship include: 

The fact that entrepreneurs are the ones who organise the other three factors of production to produce output in an economy.
They are the ones who take risks and in return receive profit which is the motivation to be successful and so stimulate economic growth.
The fact that entrepreneurs must be creative and innovative to succeed and therefore should have the skills to anticipate current and future needs to be successful and therefore increase the productive potential of an economy and thus stimulate long run economic growth e.g., as measured by a shift to the right of the PPC.
Modern economies are dynamic, ever changing and the need to respond quickly to changes is one that can be met by successful entrepreneurs. 

BUT

There may be a cost in training and educating future entrepreneurs.
The rate of success of a policy to increase entrepreneurship may be low
The success depends on other factors such as the availability of government subsidies etc. which have an opportunity cost as well as the availability and quality of the other factors of production,
Because of high risks, entrepreneurs may seek short run gain which may not encourage long run economic growth and may in fact make it less likely e.g., due to rapid depletion of scarce resources.

These should be compared with the likely importance and the advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) of increasing one other factor of production i.e., land OR labour OR capital. This may include an assessment of the availability of other factors of production.

Education is classified as a merit good because it is a private good with the characteristics of being both rival and excludable; it can therefore be provided through a market because it is possible to charge a price for it, although it can also be provided by the state. 
A public good is distinct from a private good because it has the characteristics of being both non-rival and non-excludable; it is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to charge a price for it due to the existence of the free rider problem; it therefore has to be provided by the state.

AO3 Evaluation

Public goods can only be provided by the state.
Merit goods will be underprovided in the free market and governments should intervene to increase provision.
However, if the demand for education is extremely low in a country, when provided through a market, a government could decide to provide it entirely through the state.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2Analysis

Globalisation would promote free trade, free movement of capital and labour and the transfer technology. Cultural and political ties would be strengthened.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primarygoods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to beachieved.
Globalization through trade and technology transfer should provide opportunities to create more real wealth. 
Higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country’s government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard ofliving.

AO3 Evaluation

The links between globalisation and GDP and an increase in living standards in low-income countries are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by more advanced, higher income countries. inlow- income countries
Globalisation can lead to economic dependency and significant imbalances of trade which, in the long run, might have a negative effect on living standards in low-income countries
Higher skilled work might be provided through the global transfer of labour therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place.
In somecases, individual firms in low-income countries might be outcompeted and go out of business. Unemployment might then rise and living standards might fall.
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for globalisation to improve the standard of living but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negativeimpact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not rely entirely on the material benefits gained by globalisation.

A consideration of and an explanation of the type of unemployment that might occur.
Analysis of the use of specific policy instruments and their impact on reducing a balance of payments should be provided.
Analysis of the potential impact of expenditure reducing policies on unemployment will be considered. For example, an increase in interest rates will decrease investment expenditure, decrease aggregate spending which will include spending on imports therefore helping to reduce a balance of payments deficit

AO3 Evaluation

The impact of expenditure reducing policies will depend upon the state of the economy when these policies are introduced. For example, raising interest rates when an economy is experiencing high levels of inflation and a positive output gap will have a limited effect on unemployment.
If contractionary fiscal policies are used the impact on unemployment will depend upon the main cause of the existing level of unemployment.
Contractionary demand side policies might also be accompanied by positive supply side policies which might simultaneously reduce structural unemployment.
Expenditure reducing policies might lead to the substitution of domestically produced goods for goods which were previously imported

The key characteristics of an oligopoly market should be described.
Collusion should be explained and compared to the alternative of price competition.
Some explanation of what is meant by an efficient allocation of resources.
Analysis of the links between collusion, higher prices and allocative efficiency should be provided.
Analysis of alternative price and non-price competitive approaches by oligopolistic firms should be discussed.
A large, dominant organization might have less incentive to operate efficiently and X inefficiencies might occur.

AO3 Evaluation

Colluding oligopolistic firms might argue that an increase in size will lead to more opportunities to provide a wide range of goods and therefore more consumer choice.
It is possible that collusion will lead to an increase in dynamic efficiency and this increase would allow long term more investment and ultimately lower prices. A supporting diagram can be provided.
Such a decision will enable the firms to benefit from economies of scale. For example, reducing managerial inefficiencies. This could also lead to lower prices.
Any potential negative effects of collusion can be accounted for by government intervention and regulation after the collusion has taken place.
A conclusion should refer to the preceding analysis and then make some attempt to make a judgement whether, on balance, collusion will have a net negative effect on prices and/or efficiency.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome thatachieves allocative efficiency. 
Negative externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a cost to society which is greater than that incurred by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimesdescribed as a negative ‘spill-over’ effect.
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of taxation; the use of negative advertising, direct regulation
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a negative externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not recognize the existence of a negative externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of flight use when the negative externality is taken into account.
One type of intervention might involve the use of taxation by a government. A tax will increase the cost of air travel which will decrease demand. A decrease in demand will decrease the equilibrium number of flights and achieve allocative efficiency.
A government might use negative advertising to decrease demand. A decrease in demand will lead to fewer flight, volume of air travel will fall and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a tax however it is difficult to measure the precise level of taxation required.
Also, the impact of a tax on price and demand in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly, and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of consumption is reached 
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of negative externalities, but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

Indicative contentResponses may include:AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Successful supply-side policies will cause a rightward shift in the long-run AS curve, reflecting more efficient production. This would make a country’s products more competitive in international markets and so there is likely to be an increase in net exports, correcting a deficit in the current account. Supply-side policies could include improvements in training and education, making labour markets more flexible, reductions in the powers of trade unions, an increase in competition and a reduction in rules and regulations.
Potential disadvantages of supply-side policies are that they are essentially a long-run solution and so may take a relatively long period of time to have an impact, such as improvements in training and education. Some of the policies could be quite expensive and so would involve the government in considerable expenditure, money which could have spent elsewhere (giving rise to the issue of opportunity cost).
Guidance: There are a number of alternative approaches to answering this question. At the simplest level, analysis and evaluation may focus on an assessment of the effectiveness of supply side policies only. Furthermore, this may be expanded to include a direct comparison with the effectiveness of alternative policies such as fiscal, monetary or protectionist policies. In addition, such an assessment may simply be part of evaluation. However, if supply side policies are ignored or receive scant attention then only a Level 2 mark may be awarded.

Responses may include:
AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis
Key terms ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (FDI) and ‘low-income countries’ may be identified and explained before considering the main issues that might influence the discussion. 

FDI is long-term investment usually by multinational companies (MNCs) in countries abroad.
This type of investment would normally be in fixed capital such as machinery and building factories.
Key characteristics of low-income countries would include: low levels of productivity; high dependency ratios; low GDP per capita; significant dependence on producing and exporting primary goods.
Low living standards are generally associated with: high poverty levels; inequality; poor housing, education and health; and rapid population growth.
An improvement in living standards is very closely linked with an improvement in economic performance. An improvement in economic performance is measured by increases in GDP per capita and changes in productivity which enable changes in GDP to be achieved.
FDI mainly takes place in the secondary (manufacturing) sector of a low-income economy and focuses on the provision of new technology, building new factories and training the work force. As a result of this type of investment it is likely that productivity, output, employment and income levels will rise.
More real wealth will be created and higher levels of tax revenue are likely to be received by a low-income country's government. This will enable more expenditure on health, housing and education as well as increased access to more consumer goods. These improvements are generally associated with a rise in the standard of living.
However, an overreliance on FDI by a low-income economy might mean neglecting more important domestic macroeconomic policies, which might have a negative impact on the economy in the long run. 

AO3 Evaluation

The links between an increase in FDI and GDP and an increase in living standards are not clear. Sometimes, labour is exploited by MNCs in lowincome countries. The majority of MNC profit might be repatriated rather than re-invested in the low-income country.
Higher skilled work might be provided separately by the MNC therefore training of the indigenous population does not take place. In some cases it has been argued that MNCs extract key resources and then leave.
It is not certain that a government will use the increase in tax revenue to invested in key sectors such as health, education and the country's infrastructure.
A government in a low-income economy has to decide whether to allow FDI into their economy which might produce short-term benefits but result in long-term consequences of resource depletion in the long run.
It is very difficult to measure changes in living standards. Increases in GDP might not be divided equally among the population. FDIs might introduce external costs of production which are likely to have a negative effect on overall living standards. 
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a potential role for FDIs to improve living standards but this will depend on many factors which have been referred to above, some of which might have an overall negative impact. Also, it is very important to ensure that an appropriate measure of the standard of living is used, one which does not focus entirely on an increase in access to material goods and services.

280,‘Devaluation of a country’s currency will reduce a persistent balance of payments deficit on its current account in goods and services in the short run but this will inevitably lead to high levels of inflation in the long run.’ Evaluate this statement.,20,"Use Table A: AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis andTable B: AO3 Evaluation to mark candidate responses to this question.

AO1 Knowledge and understanding and AO2 Analysis

A devaluation relates to a decision by a government to fix the exchange rate of its domestic currency at a new lower level.
A persistent balance of payments deficit on a country's current account in goods and services will create problems because it has to be financed. If it is not financed by positive currency flows on the financial account due to direct investment or portfolio investment, it will have to be financed by reducing its reserves of foreign currency. This particular problem will only apply to a country that has adopted a fixed exchange rate.
In this situation the difference between the short run and the long run will be determined by the time taken to reduce the deficit and will also be measured by the final impact on the general price level that is the rate of inflation.
A devaluation of the domestic currency will immediately make all exported goods cheaper and all imported goods more expensive. On this basis it is assumed more exports will be sold and fewer goods will be imported. This would then help to reduce a balance of payments deficit.
To some extent, the ability of domestic suppliers to reduce a country’s current account balance deficit in the short run will depend on how domestic suppliers respond to the opportunity to sell more exports at a lower price. We can measure this response by calculating the price elasticity of supply of domestic producers.
A devaluation might not solve a balance of payments deficit on a country’s current account in goods and services in the short run because domestic supply of goods might be inelastic. This means domestic producers cannot increase output sufficiently to meet the additional demand for exports.
Further analysis of a devaluation on the general price level could be provided. For example, analysis might consider the proportion of imports accounted for by raw materials and how this might affect the cost of goods and services provided in an economy and how an increase in costs might lead to cost push inflation. Links to other costs such as subsequent wage demands might also be examined.

AO3 Evaluation 

In the long run it is necessary to consider both the price elasticity of demand for imports and the price elasticity of demand for exports. The Marshall-Lerner condition states that the sum of the two elasticities must be greater than one to achieve a successful outcome. 
While the long-run impact on the current account is dependent upon respective export/import price elasticities of demand, it is also important to recognise that if raw materials such as oil constitute a significant proportion of the value of imports then the price elasticity of demand for imports is likely to be low. 
The long-run impact on inflation will be influenced by the current state of the economy when the devaluation takes place. For example, if there is a significant amount of spare capacity, the effect on Aggregate Demand of a lower price of exports might be limited.
It could also be noted that a government which chooses to use a policy of devaluation is perhaps prioritising the need to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium at the possible expense of other key macroeconomic goals such as controlling inflation.
Based on the evidence/analysis provided, it is not clear whether a devaluation of the currency will solve a persistent current account deficit in either the short run or the long run. Similarly, the impact on the general price level will depend on a number of variables which are difficult to predict or measure accurately.

A perfect labour market would assume homogenous labour, perfect mobility, identical jobs, many buyers and sellers of labour and perfect information. This would mean that each firm’s supply of labour would be perfectly elastic and a wage taker.
In perfect labour markets the wage that has to be taken by each firm will be determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the industry.
Imperfect labour markets might occur due to the intervention of trade unions or government. A monopsony, single buyer of labour would also lead to market failure. 
Market failure associated with imperfect markets will often result in lower wages and/or higher levels of unemployment.
Intervention by trade unions by controlling the supply of labour might lead to higher wages but this is likely to cause higher levels of unemployment. A diagram that illustrates supply of and demand for labour showing a decrease in supply will illustrate this potential outcome.
A government might impose a minimum wage above the market equilibrium wage which would also result in higher wages but would be accompanied by higher levels of unemployment. This analysis would be supported by an accurate, clearly labelled diagram plus an explanation. 
A monopsony firm would employ labour where the marginal cost of labour was equal to the marginal revenue product of labour. This would potentially lead to both lower wages and higher levels of unemployment. An accurately labelled diagram plus an explanation would support this conclusion.

AO3 Evaluation

In some circumstance it is possible for trade unions to increase labour productivity through increased training. This would increase the demand for labour by increasing the marginal productivity of labour which would enable both higher wages and higher levels of employment to be attained. This can be illustrated by a supporting diagram and further explanation.
The negative impact of imposing a minimum wage on the level of employment will depend upon the relative elasticities of the demand for and supply of labour. If the demand and supply are relatively inelastic then it would be possible to introduce a relatively high minimum wage which will not have a significant impact on the level of employment.
It is possible for trade unions to intervene in monopsonistic markets and undertake bilateral wage negotiations. Depending on the respective bargaining strengths of the union and monopsony, it might be possible for collective bargaining to raise both wages and employment. A supporting diagram plus an explanation would illustrate this potential outcome. 
In some circumstances a government might need to intervene to maintain the provision of vital public services as a priority, if trade unions attempt to increase wages through the withdrawal of labour. 
In conclusion it is possible to show that imperfect labour markets do not always lead to lower wages and a higher level of unemployment. Trade unions, through the power of collective bargaining, can counteract the negative effects of monopsony labour markets. Also trade unions can train labour to increase labour productivity to enable an increase in wages at the same time that employment levels are rising.

Market failure regarding this question would relate to allocative inefficiency. Market failure can be explained by defining allocative efficiency and linking this to the requirement to allocate resources to maximise consumer satisfaction. This can be supported by a diagram illustrating a level of output where AR = MC which is consistent with an outcome that achieves allocative efficiency.
Positive externalities occur when the consumption/production of a good produces a benefit to society which is greater than that received by an individual consumer/producer. This is sometimes described as a positive ‘spill-over’ effect.
Government intervention takes place to address the failure of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. In this case positive externalities would lead to under-production/consumption of a good or service.
Forms of government intervention might include: the use of subsidies; the use of positive advertising; the direct provision of goods and services.
A clearly labelled, accurate diagram can be used to show the impact of a positive externality on the level of output and the welfare loss will be identified.
The diagram could show the market equilibrium point which does not take into account the existence of a positive externality and may compare this with the allocatively efficient level of output when the positive externality is taken into account.
Different types of government intervention can be used to correct the under-production of output to enable consumer satisfaction to be maximised.
One type of intervention might involve the use of subsidies provided by a government. A subsidy will lower the cost of production which will increase supply. An increase in supply will lower price, increase the equilibrium output and achieve allocative efficiency.
A government might use advertising to increase demand. An increase in demand will lead to a higher consumption, output will rise and allocative efficiency might then be achieved.
Alternatively, a government might directly provide the good or service which can increase production and supply and eventually attain an allocatively efficient outcome.

AO3 Evaluation

A government might introduce a subsidy to encourage producers to increase output to enable allocative efficiency, however it is difficult to measure the precise value of the subsidy. Subsidies are costly in that the funds might have been used by governments for other purposes. This means governments will have to make a value judgement when deciding whether to provide a subsidy.
Also, the impact on price and output in some circumstances takes a long time to become effective.
Advertising is often costly and it is not always certain that it will have a sufficiently persuasive effect to ensure the correct level of output/ consumption is reached.
Direct provision is also costly and sometimes less efficient than that provided through market forces.
It is possible to show that government intervention can reduce the level of inefficiency caused by the existence of positive externalities but it is not clear whether the net effect of government intervention will always be positive. Some types of intervention will be more effective than others depending on the nature of the good/service under consideration.

301,A government's decision to move from a fixed exchange rate system to allow free market floating exchange rates will solve the problem of unemployment in the short run but will cause higher rates of inflation in the long run. Evaluate this statement.,25,"Governments in conjunction with central banks can fix exchange rates by buying and selling the domestic currency. Floating exchange rates are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. If unemployment is rising, there are different policy options available to governments. For example, lowering interest rates might stimulate aggregate demand which will increase output and employment. Lower interest rates however will put a downward pressure on a fixed exchange rate. In response, the central bank will either have to sell pounds or increase interest rates.
Both options will undermine policies to increase employment. If a government allows exchange rates to float freely based on market forces, a reduction in interest rates will lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency. In this case lower rates will stimulate domestic demand such as consumption/investment expenditure plus a lower value of the domestic currency will further increase demand for exports. Therefore, low interest rate policies are more likely to be successful under a floating rate system. However, it should be noted that this policy is likely to be more successful when addressing the problem of cyclical unemployment rather than other types such as structural or frictional unemployment.
Also, a freely floating currency which is allowed to depreciate will have some potential inflationary effects in the long run. For example, a depreciating currency will lead to a higher cost of imports and possible cost push inflation. In addition, a switch from fixed to floating exchange rates will mean that the central bank exchange rate policy will no longer have complete control over the money supply. This might be inflationary in the long run. The extent to which inflation might rise in the long run will also be determined by other factors, for example global expansion, rising commodity prices etc.

302,Developing economies have a high proportion of economically inactive people relative to the size of the labour force ( a high dependency ratio). This is the main reason why the standard of living is low in developing economies.  Evaluate this statement.,25,"A dependency ratio indicates the extent to which the working population has to produce not only enough goods and services to sustain itself but also for the rest of the population who do not work and depend upon those who do. Dependency ratios might be high for different reasons. Some economies have a disproportionately large number of young people under the age of 15 who are economically dependent. Some economies have high dependency ratios due to a disproportionately large number of people who are too old to work. Developing economies have high dependency ratios primarily due to very high birth rates. This will have a negative impact on living standards due to the insufficient wealth creation to enable everyone in the population to have access to food, shelter, education, health care etc. A smaller working population will also pay insufficient tax to allow governments to invest in necessary public and merit goods.
However, there are many additional factors which also contribute to low living standards in developing economies, for example, reliance on primary products, low levels of capital investment, insufficient access to training and education, limited natural resources. Also it should be recognised that it is extremely difficult to measure living standards. GDP per capita is commonly used but this omits many important factors which might impact on living standards. Based on the above, it is difficult to accept with any degree of certainty that high dependency ratios are the main reason why the standard of living is low in developing economies.

303,"Consider with the help of a circular flow diagram, why an export led growth policy is likely to be successful when a developed economy is in a recession.",12,"Export led growth is dependent on an outward growth strategy which relies heavily on openness and increased international trade. Successful growth should lead to an increase in national income, output, and employment. Concentration on the expansion of exports should be a key factor determining an increase in aggregate demand, output, and employment. This can be clearly illustrated, using a circular flow diagram which shows all withdrawals, all injections, and the change in national income equilibrium achievable via export led economic growth. This diagram should be clearly labelled and accurate showing an increase in injections (exports) producing a bigger increase in output/income/employment via the multiplier. An economy is in a recession when its GDP falls for two successive quarterly time periods. Recession will generally be accompanied by rising levels of unemployment due to a fall in aggregate monetary demand.
Government can use different economic policies to stimulate aggregate demand to move an economy out of a recession. Lower interest rates might be used to encourage investment, but this might have a limited effect due to low confidence. Government expenditure might be increased but this will depend upon the state of the public finances. When national debt is high this policy option might not be adopted. However, a policy which stimulates the growth of exports might avoid these problems and simultaneously protect the value of the domestic currency while maintaining a positive balance of payments. The effectiveness of this approach will depend upon the existing exchange rate regime used and the type of policy used, for example, lowering interest rates to depreciate a floating currency which should lead to a higher level of export growth.

304,The introduction of new technology will increase efficiency but will also cause an increase in unemployment.Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement?,13,"An increase in productivity will produce a more efficient outcome in an economy. An increase in productivity will be attained when there is an increase in output per unit of resource used in a given time period. This is usually measured by an increase in output per unit of labour employed in a given time period. The introduction of new technology in form of more advanced, more efficient machinery, should enable labour to increase productivity. However, this increase in productivity is often achieved by substituting capital for labour. As a result the level of unemployment will rise.
It should be noted that this is usually linked to a specific type of unemployment known as structural unemployment. There are a number of causes of unemployment for example, cyclical unemployment which are not linked to the introduction of new technology. Therefore, to some extent the statement might be correct in that structural unemployment might rise due to the substitution of capital for labour.
It is also necessary to distinguish between the short run immediate impact of the introduction of new technology. In the long run, it is possible that an increase in productivity will lead to falling prices, more consumer demand and ultimately more demand for labour. Also it is possible that the introduction of new technology will further reduce the cost of producing capital which will also lead to further increases in productivity. Further increases in productivity might then lead to a fall in the price of exported goods and a further increase in aggregate demand. In this case employment might rise in the long run.

305,Discuss the effectiveness of government policies which increase the net advantage of labour on the long term supply of labour in an economy.,12,"Government policies which increase the net advantage of labour will increase the supply of labour in the long run and this can be shown by a shift downwards to the right of the supply curve of labour. This means more workers will be supplied at every wage rate. The net advantage of labour can be divided into pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements. The former might include: wages, salary and bonus payments. Non-pecuniary advantages might include: hours of work, job security, promotion prospects and nature of the work. Reductions in income tax, increasing the minimum wage and the provision of skill training could be used to increase the pecuniary element of the net advantage.
However tax reductions might lead to a fall in supply because some workers will substitute work for leisure. The provision of skill training is expensive therefore has a high opportunity cost. Minimum wage might increase the supply of labour but firm’s might lower their demand for labour and therefore create excess supply. Alternatively, a government can introduce new regulations to ensure worker’s rights such as flexible working hours, working conditions, safety at work etc. Although this extra support will benefit workers new regulations are often costly to implement. In some cases it is the firm which is expected to finance improvement in working conditions and this might lead to a fall in profitability and ultimately a fall in demand for labour
L4 (9–12 marks): For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the meaning of net advantage of labour and links this to a labour supply curve.

306,Compare the impact of an increase in labour productivity on a firm in a monopsony labour market with an increase in labour productivity on a firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market.,13,"Answers should clearly identify and explain the key assumptions which explain the difference between these two labour markets. A monopsony market will consist of a single employer of labour; as a result the supply of labour to the firm will be upward sloping to the right. A profit maximising monopsonist employer will employ labour up to the point where the marginal cost of employing labour is equal to the marginal productivity of labour. A firm operating in a perfectly competitive labour market will pay a wage determined by the market as a whole. The firm will be a wage taker and the supply of labour to each firm will be perfectly elastic at the given wage.
Supporting diagrams in each case should clarify this difference. An increase in labour productivity would be reflected by an increase in the marginal physical product and therefore an increase in the marginal product of labour. In both market situations this would lead to a shift to the right of the firms MRP curve which is equivalent to an increase in the demand for labour. The impact in the case of monopsony will depend upon the extent of the increase in productivity. In a monopsony market, a significant increase in productivity will lead to a relatively higher increase in wages and employment but the extent of these changes will also be determined to some extent by the marginal cost of employing additional labour. In a perfectly competitive market, an increase in productivity will increase the demand for labour but the wage rate will remain the same.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of the difference between monopsony and a perfectly competitive labour market and a detailed analysis of the relationship between an increase in productivity, change in MRP and change in demand for labour. This analysis will then be applied to both markets and the respective impact of these changes on wages and employment in both markets will be compared.
L3 (7–8 marks): For competent analysis which clearly distinguishes between the two types of market and understands the relationship between changes in productivity, MRP and the demand for labour. An attempt should be made to compare the impact on wages and employment in both markets but the analysis will not be fully developed.

307,High market concentration ratios are closely linked to Oligopoly market structures.Explain what this means and consider its importance in relation to the pricing policy of an oligopoly firm. ,12,"Some industries are dominated by a few large firms. A concentration ratio indicates the extent to which large firms might dominate an industry. For example, 4 large firms might control more than 80% of a market while a large number of small firms account for the remaining 20% of the market. In this case the four firm concentration ratio would be 80%.
Oligopolies are market structures which can be specifically identified by noting that there are only a few large firms which dominate the market i.e. they have high market concentration ratios and they also have high barriers to entry which maintains their dominant position. However, because of the nature of this type of market structure, firms have to take into account the reaction of their main rivals before adopting their pricing strategy i.e. they are interdependent. If a firm chooses to ignore the reactions of its main rivals, this could result in a price war where each firm loses potential revenue and consumers gain. As a result Oligopolies will often adopt alternative strategies to maintain/increase market share and maximise profits. Sometimes firms will collude and agree to fix a price. This is illegal but it is still used.
Alternatively, the dominant firm within the group might become the price leader and set the market price which other large firms choose to follow. Game theory and the theory of the kinked demand curve can be used to assess which strategy might be the most effective. Most of these alternative pricing strategies will lead to price rigidity. It should be noted that many Oligopoly firms will adopt non price competition such as advertising or increasing product differentiation to avoid the negative impact of price competition.
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear explanation of what is meant by a high market concentration ratio and an attempt to link this to an Oligopoly market structure. Analysis of alternative pricing policies which might subsequently be adopted will be provided and an assessment of their likely impact on a firm's profits/market share. Some reference to alternative non pricing market strategies might form part of a conclusion.

308,Limit pricing may sometimes be used by a monopoly. It creates a barrier to entry which benefits consumers in the short run but increases costs to the consumer in the long run. Discuss this statement.,13,"Monopoly firms will control the entire market or in some legal definitions, control at least 25% of the market. Barriers to entry will be used to prevent new firms entering the market and any subsequent loss of market share. It is also assumed that Monopoly firms will attempt to maximise profits and this will be achieved by letting the level of output be determined by the point where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). In some circumstances, when the market price falls to a relatively low level, it becomes possible for a new firm to enter the market and profit by charging a price which covers its costs. To prevent this, Monopoly firms might choose to lower their profit maximising but still cover costs and still maintain a satisfactory level of profits.
Monopolies can benefit from dynamic efficiency which is likely to lower average total costs compared to a new smaller firm attempting to enter the market. The new price is known as a Limit price and this can be shown with the help of a diagram which identifies a monopoly’s cost curve and a chosen limit price which is lower than the costs of the new firm. This is why limit pricing can act as a barrier to entry. On this basis it is likely that consumers will benefit in the short run due to a Monopoly firm’s decision to lower prices. However, in the long run, if the threat of entry has been removed and with it the threat to maintaining its market share, it is possible that a monopoly will then revert to its profit maximising policy. This will lead to higher prices which will have a negative impact on consumers and higher prices might now be maintained for a longer time period because the threat of competition has been removed. 
Alternatively, the monopoly might invest the additional profits in research and development and achieve dynamic efficiency which will enable costs to be further reduced and low prices maintained.
L4 (9–13 marks): For an explanation of monopoly and why limit pricing might be used as a barrier to entry. The links between dynamic efficiency, low costs and the use of limit pricing as a barrier to entry should by analysed. The benefits to the consumer in the short run and potential costs in the long run should be evaluated and a conclusion provided.

309,Consider why it is important for a government to use cost benefit analysis when deciding how much of a public good to provide. ,12,"Public goods are non-excludable, non-rival, and usually non-divisible. As a result of these characteristics, these goods will not be provided by profit making firms in the private sector. This non-provision is considered to be a type of market failure and this is generally described as the ‘free rider problem’. Nevertheless, many public goods are seen as an essential part of a modern economy. Examples of such goods would include street lighting, national defence and road signs. Also because of the nature of these goods and the need for their wide scale provision, the cost of providing such goods is likely to be very high.
Governments do not have unlimited access to funds therefore the extent of the provision of such goods needs to very carefully estimated so that maximum benefit can be attained at minimum cost. The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to take into account negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits.
In many cases the provision of public goods will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value/cost of a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice. 
L4 (9–12 marks): For a clear, explanation of what economists mean by a public good and its relationship to market failure. The key elements of cost benefit analysis should then be set out. The link between the nature of public goods and the use of cost benefit analysis should be established and a discussion of the effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in this situation should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For an explanation of what is meant by public goods. Cost benefit analysis will be explained but not fully developed. There will be a limited attempt to link the provision of public goods to cost benefit analysis. The effectiveness of the use of cost benefit analysis in these circumstances will not be considered.
L2 (5-6 marks): For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of public goods and some of the key aspects of cost benefit analysis. There will only be a very limited attempt to link a government’s decision to provide a public good and the use of cost benefit analysis. No evaluation of the effectiveness of cost benefit will be provided.

310,Pareto optimality can only be achieved when an economy is both productively and allocatively efficient. This will create a more equitable society. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.,13,"Answers should provide a clear explanation that productive efficiency is achieved when a firm achieves minimum average total cost for a given level of output or alternatively when an economy is operating on its production possibility boundary. Allocative efficiency will be achieved when resources are allocated to ensure that the price of a unit charged to the consumer is equal to the marginal cost of producing that unit. In this case the firm will produce at an output where price (AR) = marginal cost (MC). 
At a macroeconomic level, allocative efficiency will be attained when all resources are allocated to maximise consumer satisfaction in society. This will be attained when an economy is operating at one specific point on its production possibility curve. Pareto optimality will be achieved when it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off. Any point below the production possibility curve would not be optimal because it would not fulfil this condition. Similarly an economy which is not operating at the unique allocatively efficient point on the production possibility curve would also not fulfil this condition, therefore the first part of the statement in the question is correct.
However, equity relates to an outcome where the distribution of income and/or wealth is considered to be fair. Governments can intervene, for example, through the use of re-distributive fiscal policies to produce a more equitable outcome but Pareto optimality which produces efficient outcomes will not automatically lead to a more equitable outcome. Thus the statement in the question is only partially correct.
L4 (9–13 marks): For a reasoned and clear discussion which explains productive and allocative efficiency. Each type of efficiency should by analysed from a macroeconomic perspective. The concept of Pareto optimality should be explained and clearly linked to both types of efficiency. The second part of the statement should be discussed by explaining what is meant by equity and discussing whether there is a link between Pareto optimality and equity. A conclusion should be provided.
L3 (7–8 marks): For a competent comment which clearly defines productive and allocative efficiency. Pareto optimality might be explained and partially linked to different types of efficiency. Equity would be briefly described but not clearly discussed in relation to Pareto optimality and no conclusion will be provided. 
L2 (5–6 marks): For a descriptive explanation of both types of efficiency and a definition of Pareto optimality. The link between efficiency and Pareto optimality will not be clearly established and there will be no attempt to distinguish between efficiency and equity and no attempt made to address the specific question.

329,A government's decision to increase its budget deficit as a proportion of the economy's GDP will depend significantly upon whether the economy's output gap is positive or negative.  With the help of a diagram explain and evaluate this statement. ,25,"Answers should explain that a budget deficit will occur when government total expenditure is greater than its total income. It should also be recognised that a decision to increase a budget deficit as a proportion of a country's GDP, is likely to inject additional expenditure into an economy. On this basis this policy would be expansionary, in that it has been introduced to increase expenditure, income, output and employment.
An output gap will be positive can be explained in different ways. One approach states that a positive output gap will occur when actual output is above the level of the trend output. Alternative approaches might use production possibility curves or aggregate demand and aggregate supply analysis. Each of these approaches can be explained using a diagram. Each approach should recognise that a positive output gap is associated with an economy that is overheating or undergoing inflationary pressure. A negative output gap can be explained using the same three approaches outlined above. In each of these cases an economy will not be using all its resources and is likely to be in recession. Based on the above it is clear that a government is highly unlikely to increase its budget deficit if the economy is experiencing a positive output gap. Diagrams could be used to show that such a policy in such circumstances is highly likely to lead to high levels of inflation. 
However, an increase in a budget deficit is likely to stimulate the output and employment when the output gap is negative. A diagram could be used to show the potential impact of such a policy. Evaluative comment might note that the extent of positive effect of an increase budget deficit will depend upon the cause of the output gap. It will be less effective if the gap is caused by structural unemployment rather than cyclical unemployment. Also, the use of large budget deficits to close a negative income gap might create additional problems such as high interest rates (crowding out), high inflation in the long run, or negative effects on the balance of payments.
L4 (18–25 marks) For an answer which explains what is meant by a budget deficit and how an increase in this deficit might impact on key macroeconomic variables.

330,Explain what economists mean by an increase in real GDP per capita and discuss the extent to which an increase in real GDP per capita will have a positive impact on economic development. ,25,"GDP is measured by the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy in a particular time period, usually one year. To ensure that an accurate measure of the real output is attained with we have to take account of the price element of the change in value of goods. By taking inflation into account we can calculate the real value of GDP. It is also helpful to calculate the relationship between this increase in real value of GDP and any change in population. Economists will divide the real GDP by the total population to calculate the amount of GDP that is available per person. This would now allow economists to calculate real GDP per capita. An increase in real GDP per capita is consistent with the achievement of economic growth. This potentially allows the population access to more goods and services and this is often associated with an increase in living standards.
However, economic development considers a much wider range of variables than economic growth and many of these variables are more difficult to measure accurately. Economic development attempts to measure the improvement in the overall quality of life enjoyed by the population. Key measures of development include access to education; access to health care; life expectancy; lower levels of poverty. An increase in real GDP per capita might have a positive impact on economic development because more resources will be available to provide better education, better access to health care and a subsequent increase in life expectancy. However, an increase in GDP per capita might a have a negative impact on economic development for reasons which might include negative effects on the environment; loss of leisure time; further inequalities in the distribution of wealth; unsustainable growth due to overuse of scare resources.

331,"Explain, with the help of a diagram, explain the Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap and consider the importance of the liquidity trap to government policy makers when an economy is in a recession.",12,"The Keynesian theory of the liquidity trap relies heavily upon the Keynesian theory of interest rate determination. This theory assumes that the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money. It is also assumed that the demand for money becomes perfectly elastic when the rate of interest on securities becomes very low and that the supply of money is perfectly inelastic because it is determined solely by the Central Bank. This can be illustrated by a supply and demand diagram. When an economy is in a recession, GDP will be falling, incomes will be low and unemployment will be relatively high. 
Monetary policy such as lowering interest rates might be used to stimulate aggregate demand and move the economy out of a recession. However, according to Keynesian theory, when interest rates reach a very low level, an increase in the money supply to stimulate the economy will have no effect because this policy will have no further effect on interest rates. This form of monetary will no longer work. A diagram can support this conclusion by clearly identifying the liquidity trap. If policy makers recognise the existence of a liquidity trap, they might then choose to rely on alternative policies to move an economy out of a recession. Alternative measures might include: a devaluation of the domestic currency if is based on a fixed exchange rate; the use of expansionary fiscal policies such as increased government spending and/or tax reduction; or various supply side measures to increase productivity

332,The most important aim of a central bank is to control the money supply while the most important aim of a commercial (retail) bank is to maximise profits.  Discuss the extent to which these two aims can be achieved together.,13,"Central banks have a number of important roles. One of the most important roles is the use of monetary policy to try and ensure financial stability and help a government to meet its target rate of inflation. Monetary policy would include the use of interest rate changes, exchange rate changes and controlling the money supply. The need to control the money supply is strongly linked to the relationship between the amount of money in an economy can have an important impact on the rate of inflation. Different policy instruments are available to a central bank to enable control of the money supply, these might include changes in interest rates and/or the use of open market operations.
Commercial banks are responsible for creating the largest proportion of the money supply, because banks grant loans which produce new bank deposits which automatically add to the money supply. Therefore, if a central bank increases interest rates, less borrowing from the commercial banks will take place, when bank lending falls bank deposits will fall. When this takes place, the central bank will have achieved its aim of decreasing the money supply. However, commercial bank lending is one of the main sources of commercial bank profits. On this basis one could argue that central bank policy is likely to lead to a fall in commercial bank profits. If this is true then it would seem that the two aims referred to in the statement in question are not compatible. But it could also be argued that the demand for bank loans might be interest inelastic. In this case higher interest rates are likely to lead to an increase in commercial bank profits and therefore the two aims might be compatible.
L4 (9–13 marks) For a response which explains why central banks would want to control the money supply and how commercial banks might maximise profits. Analysis of the impact of changes in the rate of interest on the money supply and also on commercial banks’ profits should be provided. A discussion of the extent to which the two aims are compatible should then follow, supported by a conclusion. L3 (7–8 marks) For an explanation of both aims and the mechanisms through which each aim might be achieve. Accurate developed analysis based on both aims stated in the question will be provided but there will be a very limited attempt to establish the extent to which both aims might be compatible. A conclusion will not be provided. L2 (5–6 marks) For a mainly descriptive comment which demonstrates understanding of why control of the money supply is an important aim of a central bank and also explains what the main influence on commercial bank profitability is. Analysis of how these two aims might be achieved will not be provided. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

333,Explain what is meant by the marginal revenue product theory and consider the relationship between this theory and a trades union's ability to gain higher wages for its members. ,12,"Marginal revenue product theory is a theory which explains what determines the demand for labour. The value of an individual worker’s marginal revenue product is made up of two parts. The marginal physical product of a worker multiplied by the marginal revenue gained by the firm when the product is sold will determine the worker’s marginal revenue product. It is assumed that each firm in all labour markets are profit maximisers and will therefore employ workers up to the point where the worker’s marginal product is equal to the marginal cost of employing this extra unit of labour. In this case, either an increase in worker productivity (increase in worker MPP) or an increase in the marginal revenue gained (MR) will increase MRP. This will shift the demand curve (MRP curve) to the right and indicate an increase in the demand for labour.
The extent to which this increase in demand will enable Trades Unions to negotiate higher wages will be determined to some extent by the nature of the labour market in which they operate. In a perfectly competitive labour market analysis will focus on a situation where wage rates are determined by the supply of and the demand for labour. In this case trade unions can raise the demand for labour by increasing training and ultimately MRP.
However wages will only rise if the MRP of all labour in all firms increase. If the increase is confined to one firm, wages will not rise. In a monopsony labour market unions might be able to achieve higher wages in a bilateral bargaining situation where unions negotiate with a monopsony buyer. The extent to which higher wages can be achieved in this situation without job losses will depend upon the relative strength of the union in relation to the employer.
L4 (9–12 marks) For a sound discussion that provides a clear explanation of the marginal revenue product theory and analyses the potential impact of a Trades Union’s ability to change MRP in both a perfectly competitive labour market and an imperfect labour market. A conclusion should summarize the differences between the two markets. L3 (7–8 marks) For a competent comment with analysis that recognises the determinants of MRP, and how this relates to the demand for labour. Further analysis will establish the links between MRP, Trades Unions and higher wage rates. However the analysis will only be confined to one type of labour market. L2 (5–6 marks) For an attempt describes what is meant by the marginal revenue product and links this to the demand for labour. A limited attempt will be made to show how Trades Unions can bargain for higher wages but the analysis will not be fully developed. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

334,Distinguish between economic rent and transfer earnings and with the help of diagrams discuss why famous sports people receive much higher pay than street cleaners.,13,"Transfer earning is the minimum payment to a worker to remain in their job. Economic rent is that payment beyond that necessary to keep a factor of production in its current use. A diagram can be used to identify this difference in the labour market. Links between the elasticity of supply of labour and transfer earnings and economic rent can be further established with the help of diagrams. Famous sports people have special talents which mean that the supply of such players is limited and very inelastic. Provided there is a strong demand to watch tennis, then it is likely that famous sports people will receive very high pay. Moreover, because their particular skill is not transferable, most of a sports person's high pay will in the form of economic rent. 
The supply of street cleaners is likely to be highly elastic because of the low skill levels required and the short training period necessary. Therefore, even if demand for street cleaners rose significantly, it is still unlikely that they would be able to gain a high pay rise. Also the combination of a high and elastic supply should lead to most of their pay consisting of transfer payments. It is possible for pay levels to fall for famous sports people if they fail to provide sufficient entertainment and the demand to watch an individual player falls or if there is a general decline in the demand to watch professional sports. It is also possible for pay levels of street cleaners to rise if they form part of a Trades Union or benefit from changes in government policy regarding the pay of workers in the public sector.
L4 (9–13 marks) For a response which uses diagrams to distinguish clearly between transfer earnings and economic rent. The links between these two concepts, the elasticity of supply of labour and the two types of labour will be then analysed. Some evaluative comment should be provided to discuss other factors than the elasticity of supply might influence the relative pay of each type of labour. A conclusion should be provided. L3 (7–8 marks) For competent analysis which links transfer earnings and economic rent to the elasticity of supply of labour. This analysis will then be extended to analyse why famous sports people are paid much higher than street cleaners. Alternative explanations relating to this pay difference will not be discussed and no conclusion will be provided. L2 (5–6 marks) For a brief and description of economic rent and transfer earnings. The links between elasticity of supply and different pay for tennis players and street cleaners will not be fully established. Supporting diagrams will not be clearly labelled and will not be used effectively to address the specific question. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

335,Monopoly firms will always aim to maximise profits and limit pricing is the only way to ensure that these profits are maintained in the long run. Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.,12,"Monopoly producers might control all the market supply or sometimes the State might provide a legal definition of a monopoly, for example, a firm which controls at least 25% of the market share. Profit maximisation is generally considered to be one of the key aims of a monopoly firm. This would be achieved by producing a level of output where marginal costs (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). Limit pricing is a policy introduced to lower Monopoly prices to deter the entrance of new competitors into the market. Monopolies can do this because they can keep their average total costs lower than their competitors due to dynamic efficiency and economies of scale. In the short run however this means monopolies will not operate where MC = MR and therefore will not be able to maximise profits. Limit pricing recognises this but the main aim is to maintain/increase market share in the long run by preventing the entry of new firms. Once this has been achieved maximum profits can be attained. So it is possible to partially support the statement in the question.
Limit pricing will not always support the view of monopoly profit maximisation. It will only do so in the long run. It should also be recognised that some monopolies will not necessarily wish to ensure maximum profits are maintained even in the long run. The Principal Agent theory suggests monopolies might prefer to aim for other long run goals such as, sales maximisation, revenue maximisation or growth of market share. In this case the statement in question would not always apply. 
L4 (9–12 marks) For a clear, explanation of monopoly profit maximisation pricing and an analysis of why limit pricing could be used and the extent to which its use would support the statement in question. Evaluative comment should also be provided to question how far the statement in question can be supported. L3 (7–8 marks) For a clear analysis of how a profit maximising monopolist would choose its output and how limit pricing works and the extent to which its use supports the statement in question. No evaluative comment will be provided to question the extent to which the statement in question is correct. L2 (5–6 marks) For a more descriptive explanation that indicates knowledge of the profit maximising pricing strategy of a monopoly and also how limit pricing might work. However, the distinction between the short run and long run impact of limit pricing will not discussed and no analysis further analysis of the statement in question will be provided. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

336,Explain what economists mean by collusion and consider the view that collusion will occur only in a certain type of market structure.,13,"Collusion takes place when firms find that it is in their interest to co-operate with their rivals to maximise profits. Usually this will mean that firms agree together to fix output or prices or both output and price. This is known as forming a cartel. It is also known as formal collusion and is usually illegal. Sometimes an informal agreement takes place (tacit collusion). In this a dominant firm will set the price/output and other firms will then do the same. It is possible to identify specific factors which would favour collusion. These might include firms are likely to produce similar products using similar production methods; firms will be large, often with a dominant firm; there are significant barriers to entry; the market they operate in is usually stable; governments do not interfere. 
Not all market structures are likely to fulfil these conditions. Firms operating in perfectly competitive markets are price takers and there are no barriers to entry. Firms operating in monopolistic competition are very small, they sell differentiated products and there are no barriers to entry. Monopoly firms, are large but by definition, do not face competition because they control all the market, so collusion would not be relevant. Oligopoly markets consist of a few large firms, which often produce similar types of goods and use barriers to entry. These factors would produce the ideal conditions to promote collusive behaviour. Therefore it is reasonable to agree with the view that collusion will only take place in an Oligopoly market.
It should be noted that although collusion can take place it does not automatically ensure that it will. Also, Oligopoly firms will still compete with each other through alternative means such as advertising and/or product differentiation. It should also be recognised that many cartel agreements break down because of cheating or one or more firms not fully sticking to the agreed rules.
L4 (9–13 marks) For a clear explanation what is meant by collusion. The key characteristics of a market which are necessary to enable firms to collude successfully should be identified. Each of the market structures should be discussed in relation to the possibility of collusion taking place. A conclusion which addresses the specific question should then be provided. L3 (7–8 marks) For an accurate explanation of collusion and a more limited explanation with regard to the conditions necessary for it to take place. At least two types of market structures should be discussed in relation to the specific question and a brief conclusion should be provided. L2 (5–6 marks) For a briefer descriptive explanation of collusion and a reference to at least one condition necessary for it to take place. Reference to one type of market structure should be made but no conclusion will be provided in relation to the specific question. L1 (1–4 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

337,Explain what is meant by cost benefit analysis and consider how it might be used by a government to decide whether a new hospital should be built. ,25,"The use of cost benefit analysis enables a government to consider all the costs and all the benefits and then make a rational decision based on maximising net benefit. Identification of all costs would be more accurate because it would attempt to consider negative externalities i.e. the negative impact on third parties. The same approach would identify positive externalities. In both cases an attempt would be made to put a monetary value on these additional costs/benefits. In many cases the provision of certain types of good will take a long time, therefore an attempt has to be made to decide the present value of benefits that might be gained from a project that will not be completed for many years. Thus although it is important to use cost benefit analysis, it is also extremely important to recognise the difficulties involved when putting this analysis into practice. 
The type of analysis outlined above would be particularly useful when considering whether to build a new hospital. Hospitals are huge capital projects; they are extremely costly and the associated benefits are only likely to be gained over a long time period. As well as private costs there are likely to be negative externalities, for example, effect on the local wildlife, increased traffic congestion around the hospital. Also there will be positive externalities, for example easier access to health care for local residents, more jobs for doctors and nurses, local multiplier effects associated with building and maintaining the hospital. When all the costs and benefits have been considered, a government has to decide whether the net benefit justifies the decision by comparing this with the opportunity cost. It should be recognised that it is very difficult to put a monetary value on externalities and to estimate the future benefits in real terms i.e. allowing for inflation.
L4 (18–25 marks) For a reasoned and clear discussion which analyses and explains the key characteristics of cost benefit analysis. This analysis should then be applied to explain government decision making, in this case whether to build a new hospital. Evaluative comment should refer to at least two problems associated with using this type of decision making. L3 (14–17 marks) For a competent analysis which clearly explains how cost benefit can be used to aid a government when deciding whether to build a new hospital. At least one evaluative comment should be provided which illustrates a difficulty associated with the use of such analysis. L2 (10–13 marks) For a descriptive explanation of cost benefit analysis but there will be little attempt to link this analysis to consider the government's decision whether to build a new hospital. No specific problems associated with the use of this analysis will be identified. L1 (1–9 marks) For an answer that has some basic correct facts but includes irrelevancies and errors of theory.

340,Describe the changes in Romanian's workforce mentioned and consider whether they have been a benefit to Romania. ,6,"In 2008, 600 000 left to seek work in higher income countries in the EU. Trend continues to deplete labour force creating shortages in Romania as the economy expands. Total population still lower today than 2008 as migrants fail to return due to lower wage levels. (2) Benefit: Government has doubled minimum national wage to reward labour's share of increased economic growth. (1) Benefit: Cost to Romania may be offset partly by greater productivity in high tech and manufacturing. (1) Benefit: Also possible repatriation of funds from economic migrants.(1) Benefit: Lower welfare payments/greater tax revenue. (1m) Cost: Economic migrants have failed to return to overcome labour shortages. (1) Cost: Wage rates still relatively low (1)

341,The information states that Romania had a budget deficit. Explain what is meant by a budget deficit and discuss whether the measures taken by the government in 2015 were likely to reduce this deficit.,7,"Explanation of the term (2)Reduced taxes would be no help initially but extra spending may increase revenue in longer term. Depends on elasticity of demand for products. Likely to reduce deficit. (3)Minimum wage may increase spending; government doesn’t have to pay for the increased wage in private industry. But they do have to pay for minimum wage in public sector. Increased income/consumer spending raises tax revenue. In the short run this would be likely to increase the deficit. In the long run the change in deficit is more uncertain. (2)
